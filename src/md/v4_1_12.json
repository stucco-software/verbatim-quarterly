As our young writers\nwould be quick to say, “<em>Ph, ps</em>, Greek, shmeek, you know\nwhat they mean.”  And if you are willing to discard mere\npickiness, you know what <em>taken for granite</em> and <em>scuenting</em>\nmean, too.

There is a taste for the elegant\nin the old U.S. of A. <em>surprizing le enought</em>.</p>\n<p>We come now to what can only be seen as phycological\nfenoninums.  Not being one of those head doctors whose title\nI can no longer spell (conditioning, accidental or otherwise,\nbeing what it is), I can but lay these before you as they\ncame before me.  They are exact in every detail of diction\nand punctuation; I would not trifle with scholarly accuracy\nin such a matter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Although our societies are formed by man, he isn't\nable to flunksuate with it's pace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Everything was fine until one day a man and a lay\ndrove up in a van.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As a catholic priest one spends most of his time\nteaching, praying, giving sermons, and absorbing\nsins given out by daily confessors.  (This was not the\nstudent whose paper included a paragraph on the\nrituals of <em>whorship</em>.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And moving ever deeper into the psyche,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>The West's women's doubles team brought the team\nback from a four-game deficate.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps properly trained researchers will get funding for a\nstudy of these.  Surely they belong not to a teacher but to a\n<em>shitisatris</em> (sp?).</p>\n<p>Well.  To end on a positive—even exuberant—note, a\nwhole glorious welling up of creativity exists that cannot\nreally be classified, though by backing off enough one can\nsee it as a kind of simplification—beating the universe to the\nultimate entropy.  For example, there is the man who had\nextra income aside from his job because “<em>he was a member\nof the notor republic</em>.”  Not a <em>horrobile</em> mistake, but art in\nlanguage.  And a <em>chairtable</em> is not a piece of furniture but an\nadjective meaning generous and kindly.  A <em>chesser-drawers</em>,\non the other hand, is furniture, as is a <em>chester doors</em>, but\nyou would have known that all right, even if I <em>hadaded</em> told\nyou.  <em>Tenashoes</em> equals <em>tenershoes</em>; a world of possibilities\nopens up here.  And a <em>stewdress</em> works on an airplane, after\nshe <em>graduwayts</em> from training.</p>\n<p>Maybe it's significant that these alternative spellings\ndeveloped in Southern California, where free spirits flower\nlike the gorgeous <em>bogangadilia</em>.  Let's hear from the rest of\nthe country.  Four cheers for the future and <em>uter caoues</em>!</p>\n<h2></h2>",
