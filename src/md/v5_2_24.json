For what has been\nhappening, however, the metaphor of a mine is less appropriate\nthan that of a magical lucky dip, from which everyone\nwho pays his sixpence pulls out in his triumphant grasp exactly\nwhat he hoped to find.  Could there be such a thing as a definitive\nhistory?  It is not a question to which Dr. Cohen\nchooses to address himself.  In a lively, but densely written <em>Introduction</em>\nhe distinguishes his intentions from those of more\nconventional historians (like R.F. Jones and Aarsleff) whose\naim he characterizes as “to establish extensive pedigrees for\nparticular ideas” [xiv] and equally from the “revolutionary”\napproach of Kuhn or the “episteme” of Foncault.  The word\n<em>practice</em> in his title is crucial; his intention (though he slips\nfrom it as the work progresses) is to concentrate on the numerous\nsecond-rank writers rather than the few prominent\nnames, and so to seek the texture of the history of ideas “in the\nchanging forms of basic texts” [xx].  His work illuminates by\nbeing subjectively interpretative; by telling you how the texture\nfeels to him, he invites you to examine and elucidate your\nown response.  In this sense it is not a beginner's book, for to\nsome degree what you get out of it depends on the extent to\nwhich you have a sense of the period to be illuminated.  It is\nnot designed to be refutable, and those whose interest in linguistics\nis confined to what is scientific on Popper's criterion\nwill be baffled by it.</p>\n<p>The substance of the book is arranged chronologically in\nthree chapters, covering the periods 1640-1700, 1700-1740,\nand 1740-1785.  For the first, Cave Beck is taken as central—\nnot the cleverest, profoundest, or most influential, but in his\nordinariness the most representative of a class of seventeenth-century\nlinguistic thinkers characterized by a series of related\nprinciples.  Sound, letters, and meaning are assumed to be\nparallel systems in which ideally words are rationally organized,\nrepresented by sequential symbols (Arabic numerals in\nBeck's case); the essentials of the system are its basic elements,\nand the representation of them must make visible sense.\nThese assumptions lead in several directions — at the practical\nlevel, to concern with shorthand, signing and visual mnemonics,\nand at the theoretical, to the ambition of using language\nto recover the essence of things and to “remake the\nworld in the image of God's first activity” [3].  But in this most\nambitious conception lie the seeds of change, for it is a small\nstep from the essence of things to the composition and coherence\nof things.  In the latter part of the seventeenth century\nboth Wilkins's realization of the limitations of tabular taxonomy\nand Port-Royal's initiation of search for the rational\nbasis of language in the order of the mind rather than the order\nof things, prepared the way for change.</p>\n<p>For the second phase, 1700-1740, Cohen claims to give\nmore than the fresh angle of view offered in Chapter 1, and\nto present “distinctive linguistic theories and techniques”\nwhich “have not been observed before” [44].  Linguistic\nwriters of the period insist on their continuity with their\npredecessors while in practice shifting the emphasis from\nelements to discourse, especially written discourse.  Even\ndiscussions of orthography are directed towards effective\nreading and composition, and syntactically determined punctuation\nbecomes a focus of attention.  Though visual signaling\nretains its importance, its purpose is not analysis and\ncataloguing but method and sequence.  The shift is seen as\nparallel to the literary change: “The shift in linguistic method\nand emphasis from lexical units to syntactic relations, from\nthe system's taxonomy to its operations, from a locus principally\n<em>in</em> the world to one principally <em>among</em> ideas, is widely\nevident in the poetry, prose, and critical ideas of the period,\nbut nowhere more characteristically, I think, than in the\nvarious ways in which a temporal aspect subsumes the\nspatial” [74].</p>\n<p>In the third phase it is taken for granted that the categories\nand capacities of language are settled, and what is of central\ninterest is internal difference—between languages, between\nperiods of linguistic history, between different kinds of linguistic\nwork.  Practical and theoretical linguistics are different\ntasks (though they may be carried out by the same man in\nthe same book, using visual, typographical cues to the function\nof each passage).  On the theoretical side attention shifts\nfrom natural or theological history and the operations, of human\nunderstanding to the origin and progress of human societies.\nIn language and in literature the emphasis is on forms\nas expressive possibilities rather than simply as the carriers of\nparticular meanings; the poet is newly explicit about the limitations\nof language, and the linguist more modest in his claims\nfor his subject.</p>\n<p>There are full and learned <em>Notes</em>, though references are\ngiven according to the tiresome belle-lettristic convention and\nthere is no bibliography.  The book is full of challenge, and\nmerits the approach it advocates.  One leaves it with a fresh\nview and can come back to it again and again to discover\nmore insights.  I plan to continue doing so, and commend it to\nother readers for its capacity as a widow's cruse of new perspectives.</p>\n<p><em>[Barbara M.H.
