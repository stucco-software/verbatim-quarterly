Despite encomiastic comments by\nvarious newspaper reviewers and William Safire, as well as a\nBIG BLURB from Ann Landers, I find the contents a mixed bag\nof good and questionable advice, of straightforward and confusing\ninformation, and of doubtful value.</p>\n<p>Plunging, with epic convention, <em>in medias res</em>, we find\nPronunciation Pitfalls, a list of 300-odd words that are frequently\n“mispronounced.”  I put that into quotation marks\nbecause some of the pronunciations given are\nmispronunciations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>bullion bul'. yun (u</em> as in <em>alumni</em>)</p>\n<p><em>bouillion boo'. yun</em> (Who <em>says that?</em>  It is not even\nan accurate French pronunciation.)</p>\n<p><em>á</em> <em>[sic]</em> <em>la mode</em>,...</p>\n<p><em>envelope en'.vah .lōp</em> if a noun; <em>en .vel'.up</em> if a\nverb (The pronunciation is fine, but that is a misspelling\nfor the verb, if case you hadn't noticed.)</p>\n<p><em>fiancée fee.ahn'.sā.</em> (But <em>fē.än.sā'</em> is given on\npage 110.)</p>\n<p><em>foyer fwah.yā</em> was the original pronunciation,\nalthough most dictionaries accept <em>foy'.ur.</em> (And,\nindeed, Mrs.  Martin should have learned by now that\ngood dictionaries neither “accept” nor “reject”: they\nreport what people say.)</p>\n<p><em>hors d'oeuvre awr'.durv'</em>.  Please note that you do\nnot pronounce the <em>s</em>.  [The French do not pronounce\nthe final <em>s</em> when they use the plural form.]  (Presumably,\nthe <em>s</em> referred to is that of <em>hors</em>, which, being a\npreposition, has no plural.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...and so on through the horrors.</p>\n<p>Preceding these Pitfalls, which seem to be traps into\nwhich the author has fallen as often as her prospective reader,\nis a chapter on Usage.  Here we encounter what might be\ntermed the “traditional” approach to among (for three or more;\nuse <em>between</em> for two) which, it has been shown, simply doesn't\nwork when a set of three (or more) may have a relation\naffecting only two at a time, reciprocally, as in the Triple\nAlliance.  There are more:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A criterion</em> is a standard test by which something is\ncompared or measured.  (A quick check in a good dictionary\nwould have revealed its correct meaning.  And\ndoes one <em>compare... by?</em>)</p>\n<p><em>decimate</em> This is from the Latin <em>decem</em>, “ten.”  It\nmeans, literally, to “select by lot and kill one in\nevery ten.”  Many people use it incorrectly to mean\n“the killing of a large number,” or “total destruction.”\n(They would certainly be incorrect if they did\n<em>that</em>, for <em>decimate</em> is a verb, not a noun, and cannot\nmean “the killing....”  That aside, there is no rule\nthat we have to use words in English in their literal\nLatin sense, and a review of <em>decimate</em> in the <em>OED</em>\nwill reveal some very respectable citations for the\nsense 'destroy' that antedate this bit of parroted pedantry.\nAnd why not object to the spelling, too?  Latin\nhad <em>decem</em>; we have <em>decim-</em>.</p>\n<p><em>draught</em> Chiefly British.  Pronunciation and meaning\nidentical to <em>draft</em>.  (Much more complicated than that\nas to meanings.  As for “identical” pronunciation, the\nBritish are likely to revolt.)</p>\n<p><em>hung</em> A picture is <em>hung</em>.  A man is hanged.  (First,\nhow about giving women equal time on this one.\nSecond, a man can be <em>well hung</em>, which is more\nthan can be said about a woman.)</p>\n<p><em>lit</em> The latest dictionaries sanction this usage as a\npast tense form of to <em>light</em>.  (I would not characterize\nthe <em>OED</em> as one of the “latest” dictionaries, and its\neditors found a citation in Shelley, which is good\nenough for most people.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...and so on.</p>\n<p>Following Pitfalls is a chapter called Beyond the Basics, in\nwhich the author has combined with her own list a list\npublished in William Safire's column in <em>The New York Times</em> of\n“Out-of-it Words” and “On-top-of-it Words.”  The former are\nordinary words for ordinary things, the latter the terms used by\nthose who, presumably, are “with it.”  Accountably, the On-top-of-it\nWords reek with jargon, euphemistic turns of phrase, and\nwhat might best be called tomorrow's clichés.  Here is a\nsampling:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>OUT-OF-IT-WORDS</th>\n<th>ON-TOP-OF-IT WORDS</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>bathrobe (for a woman)</td>\n<td><em>hostess gown or robe</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>butcher</td>\n<td><em>meat cutter</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cleaning woman</td>\n<td><em>domestic</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>divorced</td>\n<td><em>newly single</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>idiot</td>\n<td><em>developmentally disadvantaged</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>...and so on.  Some of them are merely corrections or sensible\nmodernizations:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>OUT-OF-IT-WORDS</th>\n<th>ON-TOP-OF-IT WORDS</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>icebox</td>\n<td><em>refrigerator</em> (I thought it was fridge.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>machine</td>\n<td><em>automobile, car</em> (Does anyone say that?)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>porch</td>\n<td><em>deck</em> (Not the same thing)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smithsonian Institute</td>\n<td><em>Smithsonian Institution</em> (Wrong name)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wimpleton</td>\n<td><em>Wimbledon</em> (Pronunciation)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This is just plain silly—or should that be <em>ridiculous</em>?</p>\n<p>By far the least useful part of the book is Reviewing\nForeign Menu Terms, in which Mrs.  Martin has adopted the\nrather complicated, narrow system of phonetic transcription\nused in the <em>Larousse French/English-English/French Modern\nDictionary</em>.  There follows a ten-page listing of items culled\nfrom the menus of restaurants where the author doubtless\nwhiled away many happy hours with the editor of St. Martin's\nPress, restaurants serving a <em>choix of coq au [sic] vin, biscuits</em>\n[pronounced biskyi], <em>huîtres</em> [pronounced yi:tr], and <em>boudin</em>.\nThe purpose of such a section, with its elaborate pronunciations,\nis not clear till one learns from its introduction that its\nidea comes from <em>Executive Etiquette</em>, another book published\nby St. Martin's and offering, one must assume, security to those\ntaken to a French restaurant in the course of a job interview.\nPresumably, the candidate is also taught the proper uses of\nknife, fork, and spoon.</p>\n<p>Well, you get the idea.  What else could you expect from\nsomeone who writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Calvary</em> Place near Jerusalem where Christ was crucified.\nI always remember the distinction between <em>Cal\nvary</em> and <em>cavalry</em> by associationg <em>Calvin</em> (the great\nChristian) with <em>Calvary</em> and the <em>cavalier</em> (which\ncomes from the word <em>horseman</em>) with <em>cavalry</em>.  The\nsequence of letters does it for me.</p>\n<p><em>cavalry</em> Has to do with horses.  See above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using that and other mnemonics, this could become the most\nforgettable book of the year.  Perhaps it helps explain why we\nignore many of the books about language that are published\nthese days.</p>\n<p><em>—Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
