Gage Limited, Toronto\n1967).  By the way, this dictionary mentions as well: “esp.\nU.S., lü tén \\?\\ (ü as in <em>ooze</em>) not “lyootenant,” as suggested\nby Mr. Miller.</p>\n<p>My purpose in writing, however, is not to dispute Mr.\nMiller's views, but to draw to your attention two examples in\nthe same May issue of a common misuse of a technical term.\nBruce Price, noting that sometimes the Hebrew P is our\nP and sometimes our Ph (or F), wrote: “Even with that\nschizophrenia, it's worth reporting that the alchemical associations\nassigned to the Hebrew P....”  Jeff Miller wrote:\n“Ultimately, some other Englishman or other (<em>sic</em>) brought\nthe poisonous malapropism over here, contaminating the\nfragile Canadian body politic with a rash of 'loo-,' 'lieu-'\nand 'lef-' tenants and, partially at least, the schizophrenia\nbehind it.”  Although the meaning of this sentence is\nobscure, it is evident that in both examples, the term\n<em>schizophrenia</em> is used to indicate a splitting apart or\nsplitting into two of what should be unitary.  Consistent\nwith this is the common misconception of schizophrenia as\nsplit personality, in psychiatric diagnostic terms, dissociative\nreaction.</p>\n<p>Schizophrenia, a term coined by the famous Swiss psychiatrist\nEugen Bleuler, is a derivative of two Greek roots and\nmeans literally a splitting of the mind (<em>Klein's Comprehensive\nEtymological Dictionary of the English Language</em>, Elsevier,\nNew York, 1971).  The splitting Bleuler meant was not a splitting\nof the personality into two (or more!  — as described in\nsuch popular accounts as “The Three Faces of Eve” and\n“Sybil”) but a “splitting of the psychic functions” (E. Bleuler,\n<em>Dementia Praecox or The Group of Schizophrenias</em>, International\nUniversities Press, New York, 1950) by which Bleuler\nmeant cognitions, striving or volitions, and emotions.  In the\nnormal person these are congruent and consistent; in the person\nwith schizophrenia, fragmented and inconsistent.  Although\nrarely, a person suffering from schizophrenia reports\nfeeling as if he or she is two persons, this is not a characteristic\nsymptom; so the connotation of the term as it is popularly used\nis incorrect, and unfortunate as well, since it perpetuates a\nmisconception about this serious mental disorder.</p>\n<p><em>[Paul Hoaken, M.D., Hotel Dieu Hospital Kingston, Ontario, Canada]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
