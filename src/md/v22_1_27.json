Others of you, of course, know about these splendid beasts, and their activities, in the poem “Jabberwocky”, which is found in Lewis Carroll's <em>Alice through the Looking-Glass.</em> Some of the nonsense words from this poem have been taken into standard dictionaries of the English language. <em>Jabberwocky</em> itself is given in <em>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</em> as designating “nonsensical writing or speech, esp. for comic effect.” <em>Webster's New World</em> gives this: “meaningless syllables that seem to make sense; gibberish.”</p>\n<p>You may remember that the jabberwock, <em>burbled</em> as it came <em>whiffling</em> through the <em>tulgey wood.</em> The verb <em>burble,</em> according to <em>The Concise Oxford,</em> means “speak ramblingly, make murmuring noise.” As a noun it now means “a murmuring noise; a rambling speech.” It also says that it is an aeronautical term meaning, “(of an air-flow) break up into turbulence.” Carroll may have taken it from the Scots language, in which it means “to bubble or boil up, like water from a spring”; for Scots <em>burble-headed</em> means 'stupid, confused.' <em>Whiffle</em> is defined as 'be variable or evasive.' In Scots it means either to 'drive before the wind' or to 'play the fife or flute.' I like to think that the jabberwock played the flute in the tulgey wood. According to the big <em>Oxford,</em> Carroll coined <em>tulgey</em> to designate a wood that is “thick, dense, and dark.”</p>\n<p>Others of Carroll's verbal concoctions are now found in our dictionaries, such as <em>slithy</em> (probably from <em>slither</em>), <em>gyre</em> (from <em>gyrate,</em> perhaps), and <em>chortle</em> 'utter a low, deep laugh.' There is the splendid <em>galumphing,</em> which, according to <em>Chambers English Dictionary</em> now means “to stride along exultantly; to bound about in an uncoordinated, noisy way.” Then we are given <em>frabjous,</em> as in “O frabjous day!,” which <em>The Concise Oxford</em> allows straightforwardly as meaning “delightful, joyous” and has provided the adverb, <em>frabjously.</em></p>\n<p>Incidentally, the time at which the slithy toves were doing things in the wabe and the borogoves were going all mimsy was <em>brillig,</em> which Humpty Dumpty said is “four o'clock in the afternoon—the time when you start broiling things for dinner.”</p>\n<p>When Carroll coined the word <em>borogoves</em> he gave it only one <em>r,</em> but somehow a few editors gave it a second <em>r,</em> as in <em>borogroves.</em> This led to great confusion. For example, the second edition of <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</em> (1953) gave two-<em>r borogroves</em> in its index, but in the text has the one-<em>r borogoves.</em></p>\n<p>Probably many years ago a careless printer put in that extra <em>r,</em> which an equally careless proofreader let pass.</p>\n<p>James Joyce said that this poem had some influence on him when he was writting <em>Finnegans Wake.</em></p>",
