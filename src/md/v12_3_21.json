Though not common, examples can be seen\nin obvious places, like the Droste cocoa boxes, where the box\nthe boy and girl are holding has on it a picture of a Droste\nCocoa box showing a boy and girl holding a box, which\n...you get the idea.  It is also represented on the Old\nDutch cleanser box.  (What connection may there be\nbetween the Dutch and this sort of representation?)\nAnother, albeit fleeting, manifestation is often seen on television\nas when, for example, a newscaster is shown seated\nbefore a monitor that shows him seated before a monitor\nthat shows....  For decades I have been searching for the\nword, asking people, writing to <em>English Notes and Queries</em>\nand other journals that tolerate such trivia, combing dictionaries,\nand so forth.  Being a lexicographer, hence\nexposed (at least) to a great many words, many weird, many\nwonderful, it is odd that I have not encountered the word\nagain.

A\n<em>nucleolinus</em> is the nucleus of a nucleolus, and a <em>nucleolus</em> is\nthe nucleus of a nucleus.  Thus, though I readily acknowledge\nthat the term may not be perfectly descriptive of the\nphenomenon, it should serve well till another comes along.\nAt least it is established in the language.  Therefore, to sum\nup, an added sense of <em>nucleoline</em> is 'of, pertaining to, or\ncharacterizing a pictorial representation in which an object\nappears that contains a representation of itself, which, in\nturn, contains a representation of itself, and so on, in infinite\nregression.'  Free use is hereby accorded to all lexicographers,\nthough they could undoubtedly improve on this\nwording.
