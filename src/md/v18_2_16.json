It has always seemed to\nme that we view the answering of questions of fact\n(like what a word means or what is its etymology) as\neither “easy” or “difficult” depending on whether\nwe know the answer or not.  In other words, if one\ndoes not know the date of the Flushing Remonstrance\nno amount of thinking, soul-searching, calculation,\nor any other mental activity is going to yield\nthe correct response to the question, “What was the\ndate of the Flushing Remonstrance?”; on the other\nhand, if you know that the date was 1657, one cannot\nsay that the answer was “easy” or “difficult”: it\nis like asking a person his name.  Some people have\nbetter memories than others, and we can admire\nthose who, despite the extraordinary pressure of being\nunder the klieg lights in a TV studio before an\naudience, are able to dredge up obscure information\nin response to quizmasters' questions.  But the accession\nof factual information from the recesses of\nthe memory is not the same as answering questions\nthat require rapid mental calculation or analysis.  A\nvery large percentage of quiz shows consist of testing\nthe participants' abilities to recognize familiar\nthings, like identifying the pattern K—K —- —-K— as\n<em>kick the bucket</em> before too many letters have been\nexposed.  There are several TV quiz programs in the\nUK and in the US in which the winners are those\nwho are quickest at recognizing clichés, like <em>come\nhell or high water</em>, something that the rest of us\nspend a lot of time avoiding (though we can scarcely\nhelp knowing them).  Yet, there are some who, believe\nit or not, do not possess even minimal control\nover this linguistic dross: within the past few weeks I\nheard one TV newscaster say “wheres and whyfors”\nand another refer to “a Herculanean task” (presumably\nthe labor involved in giving birth to a volcano).\n[See, elsewhere in this issue, the review of <em>Have a\nNice Day—No Problem!</em>]</p>\n<p>That having been said (to coin a cliché), quizzes\nare for some people an attractive way to learn things\nwhile playing a sort of game, testing either themselves\nor others.  In <em>Wordspinner</em>, some of the quizzes\nare mere vocabulary tests, though couched in\nlight-hearted utterances; for example, at Graffiti II\nthe reader is asked to define the underscored words\nin sentences like “Clark Kent was a transvestite”\nand “Vasectomy means never having to say you're\nsorry,” though one could think of a lot of regrettable\nactions for which vasectomy would be a feeble excuse.\nOther quizzes “test” the knowledge of the\nreader's knowledge of gay, black, or carnival slang,\nof the origins of certain words (<em>topaz</em> matches up\nwith “Greek for 'conjecture' because they could\nonly guess where it came from”), some of tautological\nclichés (like <em>beck and</em> —), others of nautical jargon,\neuphemisms, numerical allusions, Yankee dialect,\nand so forth.</p>\n<p>The range of language is, of course, vast, and\none should not treat with contempt those parts of\nthe book that deal with matters considered “common\nknowledge”: those parts that seem recondite to\none are common knowledge to another.  The challenge\nis slightly mitigated in many instances by offering\na listing of multiple choices from among\nwhich one selects the answer.  If one needs a more\ndifficult challenge, the choices can be covered by\nthe hand.</p>\n<p>There is no index, hence no way of retrieving\ninformation once encountered (except by trying to\nrecall the “name of the game”).  But that is not critical,\nfor this is not a reference book.  The 400-odd\nquizzes could serve well as a source for teachers\nwho want to test their students' knowledge of different\naspects of language.  And while much of the material\nmight seem simple to sophisticated readers of\nVERBATIM, its editor learned from <em>Wordspinner</em> that\na marriage between a brother and the childless\nwidow of the groom's brother is called a <em>leviratic\nmarriage</em> and that <em>cut the green calabash</em> is Gullah\nfor 'exaggerate.' I am devising ways of working\nthose into the conversation at the next cocktail party\nI am invited to, though that might be my last.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
