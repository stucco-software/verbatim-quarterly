Most readers of VERBATIM\nwould, I am sure, have been as intrigued as I was\nto discover that a <em>yeoman</em> is “an English landowner\noften having municipal functions”; that in tennis a\nball is <em>net</em> “when it touches the top of the summit\n[<em>sic</em>] of the net separating the two sides”; that a <em>starting\nblock</em> has “compartments in which race-horses\nare put before the off so they can all leave simultaneously”;\nand that <em>brick</em> is the English for “a sailing-ship\nwith two masts”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-a1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup>—taking part, maybe, in a <em>lofing\nmatch:</em> “in a sailing-boat regatta, the action of\none of the participants consisting in an attempt to\nbring one of his rivals head to the wind.”</p>\n<p>We are, of course, in the magical domain of\nFranglais, where it is virtually impossible to tell\nwhether the given definitions accurately represent\nthe way English words and phrases are employed by\nthe French or merely reflect one person's valiant but\nill-founded guesswork: in other words, whether such\nmassive incomprehension is individual or collective.\nLet us explore further and see if we can decide.</p>\n<p>After the regatta one would presumably adjourn\nto a <em>bostel</em> “a hotel built on the water's edge, intended\nfor amateurs of navigation,” otherwise <em>ship\nlovers</em>.  Fans of sport in general might then bet on a\nfavored <em>hurole-racer</em> or watch a bout at <em>walter</em>—“in\nboxing, medium weight about 65 kg.”—or visit a\n<em>skating-ring</em>, conceivably in the company of a\n<em>W.A.S.P.</em> “a female auxiliary in the army”; or play at\n<em>horse shop</em> “a game that consists in trying to place,\nby throwing it from about ten meters, a horseshoe\naround a post,” clad (if female) in something suitable,\nlike a <em>mode smash</em> “a type of light feminine\ncostume, specially intended for tennis-players and\neasily permitting all movements”; or simply relax at\n<em>gin-rommy</em>.</p>\n<p>Data concerning transport abound.  One may\ntravel in a <em>break</em> “a car of which the rear can be\nopened to load goods” or in an airliner affected by\nthe <em>jet-stremon</em> which is “found at a great height in\nthe stratosphere,” presumably by members of <em>jetsociety</em>\n“a group of socially prominent personalities.”\nIf one is not too old one can enjoy a <em>railway\nscenic</em> “a little train used as an attraction for young\npeople.”  (If one is too old, one must beware of <em>lying</em>\n“spontaneous and inexplicable recollection of\nyouthful memories forgotten since long ago, above\nall involving elderly persons.”)  On returning to base\none parks one's car in a motor-home—where else?</p>\n<p>Questions of business and commerce are not neglected\nin this guide, from the most basic rural matters\n(<em>pick-up</em> “agricultural equipment for the collection\nand storage of lucerne, hay, etc.”—the hay\nbeing made, no doubt, from <em>ray-grass</em> “a sort of English\nturf”) to the abstractions of high finance.  A\n<em>tresaurer</em> will doubtless be interested to hear of a\n<em>High-Flyer</em> “a stock of the future,” even though he\nmust beware of being misled by a <em>racketter</em>, involved\nin “the possibility of obtaining money by means that\nare often illegal.”  He would be better off joining\n<em>Dinner's Club</em> “an association whose members have\na certain economic solidarity.”</p>\n<p>Clothing and fashion receive due attention, as\nwell.  Given the figure, one might don <em>slooghies</em>\n“tight-fitting trousers and loose jacket of imitation\nleather worn by up-to-date young people or young\ngirls” and <em>baskets</em> “sports shoes of cloth with rubber\nsoles.”  A man, naturally, could also get himself a\n<em>hair clean</em> “a man's haircut exposing the ears and\nnape,” while a woman might prefer a <em>Catogan</em> “a\nsmall bun ending in a tuft of hair.”</p>\n<p>The conclusion is inescapable.  Franglais is a collective\nphenomenon, like fog or an epidemic, but\nthe person who compiled this volume has made a\nnoteworthy individual contribution, epitomized by\nhis assertion that <em>Union jack</em> means “the different\ncountries composing the British community.”  So\nmuch for my publishable opinion; save for a few\nclosing remarks the rest must be <em>on the records</em>,\nwhich is here defined as “part of an interview, a\nspeech or report of a meeting not made available to\nthe public and retained in the archives.”</p>\n<p>One suspects that this volume must be the work\nof its publisher, Guy Le Prat... concerning whom I\nam obliged to assume that, as they, say in the vermouth\nadvertisements, you do pronounce the <em>t</em>.  At\nany rate he has dropped more than one <em>brick</em>.  The\ngrand tradition of Pedro Carolino is not dead.</p>\n<p><em>[John Brunner, South Petherton, Somerset]</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h1></h1>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a1\">\n<p>On the other hand, this is not Franglais, either: according to\n<em>Petit Robert</em> it has been standard French since 1782. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",
