On dit qu'il marchait ci et là,/ Haut et bas,/Même\nen Calcutta./  Un peu farouche,/Et grande de bouche,/Il\nmangeait des anchois....”  Well, you get the idea.</p>\n<p>Now Alistair Reid comes along with an anthology\ngleaned from Victor Proetz's collection of memorable translations,\nbut most of these are serious ones.  At least you\nmay take as serious this translation of <em>Yankee Doodle\nDandy:</em></p>\n<p>Und niemals überfett, Herr,</p>\n<p>Und wo Gelag und Tanz und Gang,</p>\n<p>Wie'n Katz so flink und nett, Herr!</p>\n<p>Yankee, acht der Küste gut,</p>\n<p>Yankee doodle dandy,</p>\n<p>Drehn und Prahlen nichts dir thut,</p>\n<p>Yankee doodle dandy!\n</p>\n<p>Proetz, who died in 1960, was by profession an\narchitect; yet he pursued his hobby of collecting ungainly,\nunseemly, and entertaining translations like a professional\nlinguist.  His amusing comments abound in this book: in\nfailing to find Irving Berlin's <em>Over There!</em> in German translation,\nhe wrote: “...on second thought, it would have\nto be changed to 'Over Here'!”</p>\n<p>Among the pop stuff are nestled gems from Blake,\nBrooke, E. B. and Robert Browning, Burns (can you imagine\n<em>To A Mouse</em> in German?), Lewis Carroll (<em>Alice's\nAbenteuer im Wunderland</em> in which the Cheshire Cat becomes\n“die Grinse-Katze,” or, if you prefer the French\nversion, simply “le Chat”; and wait till you read “Jabberwocky”\nin French and German!), Chaucer, Coleridge,\nDickens, Dickinson, and others.  All in all, this is a very\nworthwhile book even on the surface, often belying its\nunderstated scholarship but never really answering the\nquestion of what all those Japanese and Russian whalers\nsay when they want to shout “Thar She Blows!”</p>\n<h2></h2>",
