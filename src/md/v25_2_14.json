What's the point? I thought; why say something in so few words, if you could say it in so many? Why go straight to the point, if you can twist and turn for a while with lengthy preambles, deviations, and clever word-pairings, regardless of their essentiality to the plot? Well, I got rid of the margins and so on, did away with paragraphs, and reduced the font to 10; small words that say big things, I suppose that's what they were looking for. But even so, it was terrible. It was like having a tax on words. Imagine that. Imagine all the complaints you'd get about the politicians squandering the tax-payers' money. What would the papers have to say? Not much probably. The Times's shortest article ever: “WORD TAX! Bugger.” The <em>Sun</em> wouldn't suffer too much; they'd just have even shorter texts to accompany their pictures; Big Tits; Plane Crash; Queen Mother Sick. No change there, really. The people whose job it is to write dictionaries would be (silently) cursing the day they visited their school careers officer. They'd be cursing the school careers officer, let's face it, not just the day. There'd probably be a spate of killings resulting in the invention of a new word: <em>Careersofficericide.</em> The levy they'd have to pay on that would cover their prison sentence. And just think about what would happen to the language! People would start using words like <em>notwithstanding</em> and <em>splendiferousness</em> just to get value for money, envying (how ironic!) speakers of Welsh or German whose average word contains twenty-seven syllables. Half the language would become obsolete; there'd be no more raving lunatics; nobody would love the sound of his or her own voice; or beat around the proverbial bush. And the other half would have to be abbreviated; it would start raining cats only, because we wouldn't be able to afford the dogs as well; things might at a stretch be topsy, or turvey, but never both. I expect we would do away with articles, prepositions, and conjunctions altogether, and personal pronouns, because of the disproportionally high sums of money it would mean spending on them. Adverbs and adjectives would become glib extravagancies, the playthings of millionaires, while for the rest of us, metaphor, simile, tautology, and synonym would cease to exist. Nuance would leap to the top of the popularity stakes, and the entrepreneurial amongst us would start giving courses in the grammar of body language, or taking 10-day meditation retreats involving a vow of silence. Relax in the peaceful countryside and save money! Tax rebates would cancel themselves out owing to the additional vocabulary required to demand and issue them. Silent movies would relive their heyday, and there would be mimed parliamentary debates on whether hyphened words count as one word or two. It would be no joke, or rather there wouldn't be any jokes, that's for sure. Nor poetry, stories, novels or songs. History would belong to a foregone age—something that used to happen to other people, but doesn't any more. Murder trials would be reduced to a game of charades: So, Mr. X, go ahead and act out your movements of the evening of January the 25th? That's after Mr. X had placed his right hand on the Bible and nodded to tell the truth, the . . . well, let's just leave it at that, shall we? The jury would adjourn to discuss their verdict: one knock for guilty, two for not. Still, there would be some consolation inasmuch as most drawers-up of legal documents would go bankrupt. On the other hand, claimants of unemployment benefits would have spent their allowance on the compilation of their claim forms. Manners and politeisms would inevitably be done away with, and anyone who bothered with as lengthy a prefix as “would you be so kind as to” in front of “pass me the salt” would be immediately labeled a braggart or spendthrift. There would be word-tax riots, in which students storm the streets of London without any slogans or demands, because they'd already used up their student loans on filling out their matriculation forms. Still, the riot police would be happy—having all sorts of other means of expression at their disposal. Society would be rocked. Speakers Corner in Hyde Park would have to be renamed Mime's Corner. The rich would have the last word. Mad! Absolute madness. That's what it would come down to. That's what it was coming down to, and there I was practically condoning such an outlandish suggestion by submitting myself to the task. Not that I got very far with it; didn't even introduce a single character. As for a plot, or anything vaguely resembling a beginning, middle and end, well it got a bit late for all those really. Punchy opening lines followed by tangled webs for my protagonist to weave through then wrap it all up or tie the dangly bits together at the end, leaving the reader relieved, satisfied, smug, or surprised. Or perhaps not. Perhaps he would have been a hapless cad who made a complete blunder of resolution, while our poor reader clenched his or her teeth in frustration. Well, I'll never know now. I could have done it, if I'd had a bigger page. But that way, it was all just too taxing.</p>\n<p><em>[Luisa Orza teaches English in Vietnam.
