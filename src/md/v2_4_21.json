In excavating the ruins, the ancient and prosperous town of Ugarit was discovered with thousands of clay tablets written in cuneiform, or stylus writing.  It is conjectured that the alphabet employed in these tablets was invented by a native user of the North Semitic alphabet, and that he was adept in the use of the stylus on clay.  This inference is based on the fact that out of the thirty letters used in the Ugaritic documents, twenty-two were not only similar in form and function to the North Semitic alphabet, but even appear in the same order of recitation.  As expeditions continued to operate in the Near East, similar discoveries began to unfold.  A mere decade later, another outstanding epigraphic, or stone writing, discovery was made in Lachish. It was here that the scribblings of a school boy on a clay tablet were found with the scratchings of the first five letters of the Early Hebrew alphabet.  From all of these expeditions and discoveries, the story of the alphabet gradually emerged.  It is a widely accepted fact that the word-syllabic writings of Egyptian formed the basis for the West Semitic and Phoenician syllabaries.  From these the vocalic and consonantal system of Greek emerged as a superior orthographical system.

Because all writing systems grew out of pictographs or representations of pictures, this theory was widely believed.  Diringer views this theory with skepticism and argues that the adoption of the names “oxhead,” “house,” and “camel” were merely artificial mnemonic devices similar to those which modern school children use when they recite: “A is for Apple.”</p>\n<p>The chapter which deals with the Hebrew system for representing vowels is highly informative.  Unlike the Greek alphabet, the vowels of Hebrew are not indicated by means of separate signs intercalated among the consonantal forms of a word, but are symbolized by means of separate diacritic marks placed below or among the consonantal signs.  When these letters were included in writing, they were usually known as <em>matres lectionis</em> or 'mothers of reading,' because of their function in clarifying the reading process.  The insertion of these vowel letters is sometimes referred to as <em>scriptio plena</em> ('full script'), and the exclusion or omission as <em>scriptio defectiva</em>, (defective script').  An example of the two types of scripts can be seen in the name David which was written as <em>DWD</em> in the defective syllabary of Old Hebrew, and <em>DWYD</em> in the full script of alphabetic Hebrew.  The sign <em>Y</em> is not an independent syllable, but functions as a device to guarantee that the <em>W</em> of <em>DWYD</em> is pronounced as <em>WI</em> and not as WA, WE, WO, or WU.
