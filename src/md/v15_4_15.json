A certificate issued by a law-enforcement\nagency indicating security clearance\nfor a casino employee.  See also 50 CARD and SHERIFF'S\nCARD.</p>\n<p>1963 Taylor <em>Las Vegas</em> 100.  No inside man can work\non the Strip without the county's “50” card, or\ndowntown without the city's “A” card, signifying\nclearance.</p>\n<p>1983 Clark <em>Oral Coll</em>.  We used to call a work permit\nan <em>A card</em>, but since Metro was formed [Las\nVegas Metropolitan Police, combining city and\ncounty police], we just call it and the fifty card a\nsheriff's card.</p>\n<p><em>one hand on the dice</em>, <em>n. phr</em>.  In bank craps, a\ncommand from the stickman or boxman to a player\nto pick up and throw the dice with a\nsingle hand.  Compare NO DICE and NO ROLL.\n1984 Martinet <em>Oral Coll</em>.  The house doesn't want\na shooter to use two hands in handling the dice.\nIt's too easy to pull a switch.  If somebody uses\ntwo hands, like cupping the hands and blowing\non the dice, the stick or somebody will yell,\n“<em>one hand on the dice</em>, shooter.”  If there's\nanything suspicious about the move, the stick\nwill kill the dice [stop the dice while they are\nrolling] and shove them to the boxman.  He has\nto say “no roll” quickly so there won't be a\nbeef.</p>\n<p><em>second dealing,</em> n.  The act of dealing a card\nother than the top card on a pack.</p>\n<p>1891 Hoffman <em>Baccarat</em>.  There is, however, an\nexpedient familiar to conjurers as “changing a\ncard,” which, with a little modification, is\nextensively used by the cardsharping fraternity\nunder the name of “<em>second dealing</em>.”  The result\nof the sleight is that the dealer, while apparently\ngiving the top card in the usual way, actually\ngives the second card instead of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clark relies to some extent on oral collections, his own\nand that of Thomas A. Martinet, which have been\nbuilt up over the years.  One is tempted to envision\nClark, “wired,” hanging about in gambling dens; but\nanyone familiar with the casinos around the world\nknows that those glittery palaces could scarcely be so\ncharacterized.  Damon Runyon's ghost (or the ghosts of\nsome of the personnel who “worked” his novels) will\nnot be in evidence here.</p>\n<p>According to the Dictionary, a <em>chute</em> is the name\nfor the slot (over the <em>drop box</em>) through which the\ndealer pushes the money paid for chips at a gaming\ntable.  According to Monte Carlo folklore, it was a\nslide, accessible only through a trap-door, that emptied\nout into the Mediterranean far below: the bodies\nof gamblers who had taken their own lives after losing\nthe family fortunes were dispatched through the chute\ninto oblivion.  What happens to bodies in Atlantic City,\nLas Vegas, and other gambling hells is not revealed in\nthis book, but one can be sure that those who run the\nestablishments do not take kindly to losers who ask for\ntheir money back, explaining that they did not know\nthat they were playing “for keeps.”</p>\n<p>There have been other dictionaries on the subject:\nClark lists the important ones as Sources at the end of\nthis volume.  But this work is probably the best of them\nall.  <em>The Dictionary of Gambling</em> &amp; <em>Gaming</em> is not a\ngamble, and anyone putting down his $48 will be betting\non a sure thing.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
