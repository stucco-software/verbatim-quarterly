In the final vote, which took\nplace one month later, the proposal for translation\nwas defeated.  The ayes and nays of the final vote are\nnot recorded.

But while Muhlenberg's\nvoting record in the Third Congress did not seem to\nannoy his German American constituents, they did\nreact quite strongly when, as Speaker of the Fourth\nCongress, he stepped down and cast the deciding\nnegative vote against the Jay Treaty.  This action\ncaused his brother-in-law to stab him, and it cost him\nhis congressional seat in the 1796 election as well.\nThis significant tie-breaker soon became confused\nwith the earlier adjournment cliffhanger, conveniently\nfleshing out the myth of the German vote.</p>\n<p><em>[Dennis Baron, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>[<em>A helpful letter from Colyn L.
