<p>Millions of people have delighted in solving crossword
puzzles ever since their introduction in the 1920s the first
successful book published by Richard Simon and George
Schuster was a collection of crossword puzzles, and look at
Simon and Schuster today!  From the beginning, solvers were
taught about 'volcanic lava,' 'bitter vetch,' 'Persian fairy,'
'young salmon,' and other esoterica dredged from the nether
reaches of the language by the compilers who needed odd bits
and pieces to fill in the gaps with <em>aa, ers, peri</em>, and <em>smolt</em>.</p>
<p>British puzzles, which came later, require little of this
linguistic detritus because only alternate characters in horizontal
words are crosskeyed to vertical words (and vice versa);
besides, British puzzles tend more toward the kinds of clues
found in America in the “puns and anagrams” puzzles, though
recent imports from Britain are called “cryptic” crosswords.
(For a rather easy American version, see our Anglo-American
Crossword on page 24.)</p>
<p>This book defines and, in many instances, illustrates the
odds and ends of (mainly) the English found in crossword
puzzles.  One omission noted is <em>parr</em> 'young salmon,' but for all
I know, that may be a common word on everyone's lips and,
hence, has no place in this collection.  Mercifully, the compilers
have avoided listing the kinds of nonsense appearing in so
many puzzles today: ' go home' as the clue for <em>I wanna</em>,
'Pierre's nail' for <em>ongle</em>, etc.  Such items are used by bad puzzle-makers
(and published by worse puzzle editors): the English
lexicon is sufficiently replete and solvers should not be expected
to know French, German, or Swahili; multiword combinations
have long been standard in cryptic puzzles (where the arrangement
of words and the number of characters of each is usually
given), but they have only recently begun to creep into
American-style puzzles, where they have no place.</p>
<p>American puzzles some, at least have become tricky but
more in the wiseguy mode than by becoming clever.  Also, more
and more of them contain outright errors of fact, which is
inexcusable.  These shortcomings are to be laid at the door of
the editors who seem increasingly less capable or less energetic
in checking for accuracy.</p>
<p>All that criticism has nothing to do with <em>The Illustrated
Encyclopedia of Crossword Words</em>, which is good fun and
should be in the library of every puzzle-solver if only to inform
him about what he has been doing all these years.  [If copies are
