One\nexample, not the author's fault, is the comment,\n“The editors of the <em>Random House Dictionary</em> of\n1966 decided, after considerable agonizing, not to\ninsert any four-letter words.”  As I was in charge of\nthat edition, let me set the matter straight.  There\nwas no agonizing whatsoever on the part of the editors:\nevery editor associated with the book wanted\nthose words in.  Jess Stein and I attended the meetings\nat which these sensitive matters were discussed\nand were invited to put our case, though we were\nfully aware that the ultimate decision rested with\n(particularly) the sales department.  The sales director\nat the time (1965) was Lew Miller, as wise and\nexperienced a marketing man as one could find in\npublishing; Bob Bernstein was president; Bennett\nCerf was chairman of the board, and the other important\ndirectors were Donald Klopfer and Tony\nWimpfheimer.  After Jess and I presented our case,\nLew Miller said he needed a week or so to think\nabout the matter.  Bennett was going out of town on\none of his many lecture tours, while the final stages\nof reading proof proceeded in the reference department,\nof which I was director.  Whichever way it\nwas to go, we were ready to abide by Lew's decision.\nAbout ten days later, Bennett returned and,\nencountering Bob in the corridor, asked him about\nthe “four-letter decision”; “<em>Shit</em> and <em>piss</em> are in,” replied\nBob, “<em>Fuck</em> and <em>cunt</em> are out.”  Lew Miller's\ndecision had been a practical one: he felt it foolish to\nsacrifice the sales of many thousands of copies of the\ndictionary in the Bible Belt and other puritanical\nbastions of conservatism like Texas and California\nmerely for the sake of a “couple of four-letter\nwords.”  (Those who think of California as a paragon\nof avant-garde thought may need reminding that the\nschool-marms there succeeded in banning the sale of\nthe <em>Dictionary of American Slang</em>, by Wentworth and\nFlexner, in the 1970s, by which time one might\nhave thought that their moral fiber would have\ncaught up with their professed modernity.)</p>\n<p>John Ayto, editor of the <em>Bloomsbury Dictionary\nof Word Origins</em>, reviewed elsewhere in this issue,\nwill not be happy to see his name misspelled\n“Ayton.”  Also, in a section best described as\n“Webster-bashing,” Bryson fails to mention Joseph\nEmerson Worcester and his competing dictionaries,\nin some ways superior to Webster's, and I cannot\nagree with the comment [p.150] that the simplified\nspellings advocated by Webster “would probably\nhave happened anyway”—they didn't happen “anyway”\nin Britain, where, despite the fact that many of\nthe forms cannot be justified etymologically or any\nother way, the conservatives continue to heap scorn\non American spelling.  I think it misleading to describe\nthe section A to Ant of <em>The New English Dictionary\non Historical Principles</em> (the original title of\nthe <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>) as “a slim paperback\nbook”: it was the first fascicle to be published and\nwas not the “first of twelve volumes.”  (The <em>OED</em>\nwas originally published over a number of years in\nfascicles of various lengths which were sold by subscription,\na method that is, alas, no longer practised.)\nThese are details, I know, but that is no excuse\nfor not getting them right, especially when the\naccurate information is so easily accessible.</p>\n<p>I am willing to take Bryson's word for many of\nthe bits of information with which this book\nabounds, to wit, “Among the Xoxa tribe of South\nAfrica the most provocative remark is <em>hlebeshako</em>—\n'your mother's ears,' ” the wisdom that “Some cultures\ndon't swear at all,” and the revelation that in\nFinland, “When you stub your toe getting up to answer\nthe wrong number at 2.00 a.m.,” you mutter\n(shout?) “Ravintolassa!,” which means 'in the restaurant.'\nOne hesitates to consider what the restaurants\nmight be like in Finland, or, indeed, what the waiters\nsay when they drop a tray, perhaps “Hlebe-shako\n!”</p>\n<p>There is much to interest and amuse the reader\nin <em>Mother Tongue</em>, and I find it a pity that teachers do\nnot use books like this to introduce students to the\nwonders and humor of language to reinforce what I\nhope is their own enthusiasm for the subject in place\nof the turgid texts they are stuck with.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
