Barnhart, (Hammond, 1986), xxiv + 740pp.</p>\n<p>These days the general public and the media\nexhibit an increasing inability to distinguish between\nscience and technology.  Indeed, it is not always easy\nto draw the distinctions, though the editors of this\nbook (<em>HBDS</em>) have achieved some measure of consistency.\nThus, <em>radiology</em> is in but not <em>radiography</em> or\n<em>radiograph</em>; on the other hand “ 'a photograph made\nby means of X rays,' ” is given as the second definition\n(after the <em>Physics</em> definition) under <em>X ray</em>.  This illustrates\nnot a shortcoming of the dictionary but of the\nproblems encountered in trying for a separation\nbetween technology and science: omitting the photo\nsense would have been silly; including it violates the\nmost stringent application of principle.  In those\ninstances I have checked, the editors have erred on the\nside of common sense.  <em>Wheel</em> and <em>axle</em>, a simple physical\nmachine, is in; <em>wheel</em> is not.</p>\n<p>For the student of science and for any person\nfunctioning outside his own discipline, whether scientist\nor layman, the <em>HBDS</em> is a fine work.  The only\nfault I find with it is in its illustrations of ostensive\nobjects, many of which are crudely executed.</p>\n<p>The style of defining is explanatory and straightforward:\nthe editors have eschewed the stilted, formulaic\ndefinitions so often found in many dictionaries,\nespecially those compiled by amateur lexicographers\nwho seem to feel that definitions must be written in a\nturgid, old-fashioned way.  Thus, for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>graft... 2</em> <em>Biology, Medicine</em> a to transfer (a\npiece of skin, bone, etc.) from one part of the\nbody to another, or to a new body, so that it will\ngrow there permanently.</p>\n<p><em>renal...</em> <em>Anatomy</em>. of, having to do with, or\nlocated near the kidneys: <em>renal arteries</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This latter is certainly preferable to the “of or pertaining\nto ...” or “of or relating to...” which pervades\nmost dictionaries.  I might pick a bone with\n“located near” for which I should have preferred “situated\nnear.”  Generally, I like the almost conversational\napproach.</p>\n<p>One particular nasty problem in scientific defining\nfor the layman—for much of this century—has\nbeen a definition of <em>relativity</em>.  The <em>special theory</em> and\nthe <em>general theory</em> present serious obstacles to the\ndefiner for several reasons, the most important being\nthat neither can be adequately defined in the compass\nof a paragraph.  Another is that there are few people\nwho truly understand the theories.  Yet, the terms are\nbandied about by amateurs, in contrast to other highly\nspecialized terms in science, most of which are seldom\nencountered outside their disciplines.  In the circumstances,\nthe editors have, I think, done very well,\nindeed.</p>\n<p>Entries incorporating uncommon words show\ntheir pronunciations in a respelling system that is easy\nto use and for which essential key information is provided\non odd-numbered pages.  In some cases, brief\netymologies are provided.  Some of the illustrative\nexamples are contrived (e.g., <em>renal arteries</em>); those\nthat have been taken from scientific writings do illustrate\nthe entry in context, but they are not always\nrevealing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>scatter... 2</em> to undergo scattering: <em>The\nmajority of the energy is carried by phonons\nwhich inelastically scatter at the interface</em>\n(Nature).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such instances, however, are rare, and most of the\ncitations I read provided not only syntactic evidence of\nthe use of the term in context but yielded up additional\ninformation not provided by the definition\nitself.</p>\n<p>This is a fine work, certainly usable at the secondary\nschool level and by people of any age and persuasion\nwho need ready access to good definitions in the\nsciences.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
