Only one of the contributors\nis at Yale, and the ghost of Frederick Pottle\nand his colleagues in the “Boswell Factory” should\nbe delighted that there has been such widespread\nenthusiasm for the field they have ploughed for the\npast six decades.  Professor David Daiches of Edinburgh\nleads off with a splendid introduction on Boswell's\nambiguities, writing about the biography that\n“the subject understood the biographer more profoundly\nthan the biographer understood the subject.”\nTrue enough, but Johnson's intellectual capacity\nwas greater than Boswell's <em>ab initio</em>.

Boswell's ambiguities and internal contrarieties\nare neatly shown in his treatment of William\nRobertson, Principal of Edinburgh University,\npraising his literary skills but inveighing against his\ntheology.  Pat Rogers (University of South Florida)\nprovides Boswell's attitude to and use of Scotticisms\nboth in writing and in speech; at one time, we are\ntold, Boswell considered compiling a dictionary of\nwords peculiar to the Scottish tongue.  Joan Pittock\n(Aberdeen) undertakes the important task of evaluating\nBoswell as a critic.  She points out that had he\nlived in this century he would have excelled as an\ninterviewer, much like David Frost.</p>\n<p>Boswell wrote a considerable volume of published\nwork before he began the <em>Life of Johnson</em>, preliminary\ntrials of strength.  Thomas Curley (Bridgewater\nState College) uses his <em>Account of Corsica</em> as\nan example of a travel book in the same genre as\nSterne's <em>A Sentimental Journey</em> and Smollett's <em>Travels\nthrough France and Italy</em>.  It is also a tract on political\nliberty, and Curley quotes the epigraph from the\nCorsican rejoinder to a Pope in 1320: “Non enim\npropter gloriam, divitias aut honores pugnamus, sed\npropter libertatem solummodo quam nemo bonus\nnisi simul vita amittit.”  [For we fight not for glory,\nriches, or honors, but solely for liberty, which no\ngood man loses except with his life.]  Gordon Turnbull\n(Yale) focuses on Boswell's account of his defense\nof the sheep-stealer John Reid to illuminate\nBoswell's sense of sympathy, one of a biographer's\nnecessary skills.  Richard Schwartz (Geogetown)\nuses Boswell's interview with Hume on his deathbed\nto explore Boswell's own philosophy as well as his\nattitude toward death and the life hereafter.  Susan\nManning (Newnham, Cantab.) deals with Boswell's\nepisodes of melancholia, a trait he shared with Johnson,\nand his essays on it in <em>The Hypochondriack</em>.</p>\n<p>The above essays set the stage for essays dealing\ndirectly with the <em>Life</em>.  The first of these is an outstanding\naccount of Boswell's treatment of the famous\nquarrel between Johnson and Lord Chesterfield.\nJohn Burke (Alabama) reviews and analyzes\nother contemporary accounts and finds that Boswell's\nis not only the most accurate but that he uses\nit to demonstrate Johnson's character, whereas others\nwere merely retailing literary gossip.  Marlies\nDanziger (Hunter) takes up the question of Boswell's\nauthorial comments that are interspersed\nthroughout the <em>Life</em>.  Certainly he intrudes himself\ninto the scenes, sometimes for sheer self-display, but\nalso for a variety of other purposes, all of which are\ncarefully examined.  Paul Korshin (Pennsylvania)\nsupplies a masterly analysis of Johnson's conversation\nas recorded by Boswell, sometimes a bit long\nafter the fact.  It may be true that Boswell's formal,\nhighly generalized diction, quite possibly encouraged\nby Malone, is no longer to our taste, that is, not\nthe diction of twentieth-century biographers; but if\nso, so much the worse for 20th-century readers of\nbiography.  Donna Heiland (Vassar) comments on\nother contemporary biographies of Johnson.  She\ncomments that Boswell presents Johnson as a divine\nfigure with Boswell as his priest.  “The paradox inherent\nin the concept of divinity incarnate is the\nepitome... of the dichotomy in Boswell's portrayal\nof his subject.  Boswell reveres Johnson, and at the\nsame time manipulates him continually.”  Greg\nClingham (Fordham), the editor, modestly places his\nessay last.  He attacks the complex question of\n“truth” vs.  “authenticity” in Boswell's portrait of\nJohnson, and therein lies the art of biography.</p>\n<p>This is an exceptionally fine collection of scholarly\nessays, greatly to be valued by readers interested\nin Boswell and Johnson.  Though some of the\nmost opaque prose written today is by Ph.D.s in\nEnglish Lit., these essays are largely free of that\nfault.  Perhaps their clarity owes something to their\nsubject.  Both Boswell and Johnson wrote readable\nand lucid prose, and scholars who gloss their texts\ncannot resist their influence, which is all for the\ngood.  The contributors have, as Johnson advised\nBoswell, rid their minds of cant.</p>\n<p><em>[William B. Ober, M.D., Tenafly, New Jersey]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
