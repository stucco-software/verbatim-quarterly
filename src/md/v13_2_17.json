Because of the\nsometimes bizarre nature of English orthography,\nwords which, to the eye, should <em>not</em> rhyme, to the ear\n<em>do</em> rhyme: <em>journal/colonel; busy/dizzy; who/Sioux;\nblubbered/cupboard</em>.</p>\n<p>The reverse process is also common: there are\nmany words in English that look as if they should\nrhyme with one another but do not.  These are called\n<em>eye</em> (or <em>sight) rhymes</em>.  (They should be distinguished\nfrom the heteronyms previously discussed by Donald\nDrury in VERBATIM [IX, 3 and X, 1]: heteronyms have\ndifferent pronounciations but, because of their <em>identical\nspellings</em>, they would never, strictly speaking, be\ntaken for rhymes.)</p>\n<p>Rhyme, in the history of literature, is a relatively\nrecent phenomenon.  It was not a device which was\nintegral to Greek, Roman, or early Anglo-Saxon poetry.\nBy the time of Chaucer, however, rhyme was\nwell-established.  Scholars speculate that its rise to\nprominence came about through its use in the Catholic\nChurch as a mneonic aid in religious ceremonies.</p>\n<p>To historians of the English language, rhyme has\nproved to be a useful key in determining how words\nwere pronounced at different times and in different\nplaces.  Thousands of examples could be cited, but this\nexcerpt from Dryden's <em>The Hind and the Panther</em> (I:\n445-447) should suffice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Without respect they brush'd along the wood,\nEach in his clan, and, filled with loathsome food,\nAsk'd no permission to the neighb'ring flood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Three words which once contained the same vowel\nsound have, over a period of three hundred years,\nparted company.  Strictly speaking, Dryden's use of\n<em>wood/food/flood</em> does not constitute an eye rhyme\nbecause at the time that he used these words, they\nactually did rhyme.  If the words were used today in a\nsimilar manner, however, they would constitute eye\nrhymes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Coleridge's Ancient Mariner says (II: 53-56):</p>\n<p>And every tongue, through utter drought,<br>\nWas withered at the root:<br>\nWe could not speak, no more than if<br>\nWe had been choked with soot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this instance Coleridge is making use of a genuine\neye rhyme.</p>\n<p>I suppose that most word lovers are addicted to\nmaking lists and notations of curiosities they encounter.\nEye rhymes have been a consuming interest of\nmine for years.  I cannot say exactly what precipitated\nthis mania, but I do know the first example which\nwent into my notebook: <em>mint/pint</em>.  Dozens of other\nitems have been added to the list since then.  I doubt\nthat my list even approaches completion.  My teaching\nand writing duties have never allowed me the time to\nsearch an unabridged dictionary in a methodical manner;\nwith such perseverance this list might be several\ntimes longer.</p>\n<p>The eye rhymes below have been alphabetized\nfrom that vowel after which all remaining letters are\nidentical.  Most of my items are in pairs, but there are\na few triplets and one sextuplet—or septuplet, if I am\ngranted a Scottish pronunciation given in the <em>OED</em>.  In\nmany cases I have let one word arbitrarily represent\none or more other words.  For instance, <em>come/dome</em>\ncould as easily be <em>some/home</em>.  Some examples are a\ntouch obscure.  Some, depending on the reader's dialect,\ncan be made to rhyme.  And I'm never completely\nhappy when I include a proper noun.  On the whole,\nthough, the list illuminates another of those curiosities\nwhich make the English language a constant source of\nwonder.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A</em></p>\n<p>rabot/sabot<br>\ngames/Thames<br>\ngasp/wasp<br>\nface/pace (prep.)<br>\nran/wan<br>\nbass (voice)/pass<br>\nache/cache<br>\nsand(er)/wand(er)<br>\ncaste/waste<br>\ntaco/Waco<br>\ncanes/manes (souls)<br>\nfasten/hasten<br>\npad/wad<br>\nhanger/manger<br>\nchat/what<br>\npaddle/waddle<br>\npant/want<br>\nlatch/watch<br>\nbade/wade<br>\ncanton/wanton<br>\nlater/water<br>\nHades/shades<br>\ncar/war<br>\nbather/father/lather<br>\nbaffle/waffle<br>\ngarble/warble<br>\npatio/ratio<br>\nraft/waft<br>\ncard/ward<br>\ncattle/wattle<br>\nbagged/ragged<br>\ngarden/warden<br>\nmature/nature<br>\nague/vague/Prague<br>\nare/care<br>\ndaughter/laughter<br>\npaid/plaid/said<br>\ncares/lares<br>\nlavage/savage<br>\nbake/sake (alcohol)<br>\nscarf/wharf<br>\ncave (beware)/gave<br>\nbaked/naked<br>\nfarm/warm<br>\ngavel/navel<br>\nbalance/valance<br>\nbarn/warn<br>\nhaven/raven (prey)<br>\n(vā—)<br>\nharp/warp<br>\nslaver (drool)/waver<br>\nhall/shall<br>\nmarry/starry/quarry<br>\ntaxes/axes (plural of <em>axis)</em><br>\nmallet/wallet<br>\ncart/wart<br>\ngallop/wallop<br>\ngas/has/was<br>\naxis/taxis<br>\ncallow/wallow<br>\nbase/rase<br>\nquay/say<br>\nally/rally<br>\nbaseline/vaseline<br>\nplayer/prayer<br>\nsalve/valve<br>\ncash/wash<br>\npays/says<br>\nrename/sesame</p>\n<p><em>E</em></p>\n<p>be/re (musical note)<br>\nease/lease<br>\nhere/there/were<br>\nsea/yea<br>\nbeast/breast<br>\nerring/herring<br>\nbead/head<br>\nbeat/great/teat<br>\ndespite/respite<br>\ndeaf/leaf<br>\nbreath/wreath<br>\nfetched/wretched<br>\nbeak/steak<br>\nbeer/freer<br>\nether/tether<br>\nleaked/peaked<br>\nheight/weight<br>\npetty/pretty<br>\n(sickly)<br>\ndemise/premise<br>\nbrevet/chevet<br>\ndeal/real (money)<br>\ndemon/lemon<br>\ndevil/evil<br>\ndean/Sean<br>\nlenses/menses<br>\nfew/Jew/sew<br>\nfear/wear<br>\nNepal/sepal<br>\nfey/key<br>\nbeard/heard</p>\n<p><em>I</em></p>\n<p>hi/mi<br>\nclimber/limber<br>\nfir/pir<br>\nchic/tic<br>\nprimer (school-book)/timer<br>\nhis/this<br>\nlicked/wicked<br>\nlist/Christ<br>\ndie/Brie<br>\nimply/simply<br>\ndistress/mistress<br>\ndied/Lied (song)<br>\nbind/wind (air)<br>\nlithe/withe<br>\nlien (spleen)/mien<br>\nfinger/ginger/singer<br>\ngive/hive<br>\ndrier/tier<br>\nstingy/stringy<br>\nshrieve/sieve<br>\nmint/pint<br>\nonion/Orion</p>\n<p><em>O</em></p>\n<p>go/to<br>\nbrooch/pooch<br>\nfosse/posse<br>\nbroad/load<br>\nfood/flood/wood<br>\ncost/post<br>\nkoan/loan<br>\nhoof/roof<br>\nboth/moth<br>\ndoes (verb)/hoes/shoes<br>\ncool/wool<br>\nbother/mother<br>\ndoor/poor<br>\npouch/touch/mouch<br>\ncolder/solder<br>\nchoose/loose<br>\nbough/cough/though/through/hiccough/rough/sough (Scot. pronunciation)<br>\ngolf/wolf<br>\nboot/foot<br>\ndoll/poll<br>\ncoped/moped (motorbike)<br>\nholly/wholly<br>\ncolor/dolor<br>\ncord/word<br>\nmom/whom<br>\ncores/mores<br>\nfoul/ghoul/soul<br>\nRoman/woman<br>\ncork/work<br>\ncould/mould<br>\nbomb/comb/tomb<br>\nform/worm<br>\npound/wound (injury)<br>\ncome/dome<br>\nlorry/worry<br>\nomen/women<br>\ngorse/worse<br>\npour/sour/your<br>\ndon/son<br>\nmort/wort<br>\nbourse/course<br>\nponder/wonder<br>\nforte (music)/torte<br>\nmouth/your<br>\nbone/done/gone<br>\nforth/worth<br>\nclover(r)/lover(r)/move(r)/<br>\ndonkey/monkey<br>\nchose/dose/lose<br>\ndonor/honor<br>\nMoses/roses<br>\nnovel/shovel<br>\ncow(er)/low(er)<br>\nbowl/fowl</p>\n<p><em>U</em></p>\n<p>hue/rue<br>\ncure/sure<br>\nfuss/puss<br>\nbuffet (sideboard)/tuffet<br>\nbury/fury<br>\nbut/put<br>\nbused/fused<br>\nbutch/hutch<br>\nrugged/slugged<br>\nbush/rush<br>\nlumber/plumber<br>\nhumor/rumor<br>\nhunger/plunger</p>\n<p><em>Y</em></p>\n<p>cyan/Ryan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>",
