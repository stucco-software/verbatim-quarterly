The butt of the joke replies <em>dos chalindas,</em> 'two ties.' The final <em>s</em> is pronounced as an <em>h</em> sound, an almost imperceptible breathing.  The reduction of final <em>s</em> to a breathing was a common speech pattern in unstressed syllables at the ends of words. The game continues until the butt of the joke reaches eight: <em>ocho chalindas,</em> at which point everybody laughs and points their fingers.  The phrase translates as 'eight ties,' but also sounds like <em>O chocha linda,</em> 'O what a beautiful cunt!'; and the joke is sprung.  A slang word for vagina at the time was <em>chocha</em>, probably a feminine version of <em>chocho</em>, a vulgar usage frequently glossed by Spanish dictionaries as 'vulva.' The uaccented vowels at the ends of both words would likely reduce to schwas.</p>\n<p><em>[Michael T. O'Neill, Arlington, Texas]</em></p>",
