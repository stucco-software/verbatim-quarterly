Shapiro</span></h1>\n<p>In his article, “That Dirty Bird,” on the onomastic\nmigrations of the shitepoke [III, 3], Steven R. Hicks makes\npassing reference to the intriguing word <em>shyster</em>, an American\ncolloquialism dating from at least as early as 1846 (see Mitford\nMathews, <em>Americanisms</em>, 1966).  Like Mr. Hicks, I have\nalways taken for granted that it derives from the German\n<em>Scheiss</em>, 'shit,' (despite other esoteric possibilities put forth\nby Mencken).  Not, however, via <em>Scheisser</em>, as he assumes\nalong with Partridge and others, but rather from an oral\nform <em>scheiss</em>-ster, by analogy with so many nouns in which\nthe venerable suffix -<em>ster</em> originally implied contempt.\n(Needless to say, it no longer always does so: witness <em>youngster</em>,\n<em>roadster, songster</em>, and scores of others.)  Partridge supposes\na transmission from German through Yiddish.  This is, I\nthink, a debatable suggestion, since the usual Yiddish word\nfor the substance in question is <em>drek</em>, not <em>scheiss</em> (which, if\nused at all, would very likely have undergone a standard\nvocalic shift—moved its vowels, so to speak—and been\npronounced “shayss,” hence an unlikely forebear of <em>shyster</em>).</p>\n<p>But scatymological considerations aside, readers may\nbe interested in another proposed derivation, found in\nFarmer and Henley's <em>Slang and Its Analogues</em> (1890-1904).\nThis invaluable volume, reprinted by the Arno Press in 1970,\noffers the following citation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. DE VERE, <em>Americanisms</em>,... This is the\nSHYSTER ... Ill-reputed men [who] offer their services\nto the new-comer, compel him to pay a fee in advance,\nand then—do nothing.  On the contrary, they fight\nSHY of him, and hence they have obtained their name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However logical this early etymology, partisans of\n<em>Scheiss</em> will probably not be budged.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the alimentary canal, John G.\nCaffrey, in the same issue, calls attention to the phenomenon\nof what he terms the “dropped d” in names of foods and\ndishes (<em>chop sirloin</em>, et al.).  Many common examples might\nbe added to his list.  Foremost among them, <em>ice coffee, ice\ntea</em>, and especially <em>ice cream</em>.  The <em>OED Supplement</em>\ndocuments this last apocopated form in a passage from 1744,\ndecades before Dolley Madison introduced the White House\nto her dessert.  The original, <em>iced cream</em>, is attested as early\nas 1688.  Coincidentally, cream also provides a recent\nexmaple of what can be dubbed an “added d.”  Some dairy\nfood companies have lately taken to calling their product\n<em>soured cream</em>, apparently in an effort to destigmatize it\nsomehow by giving the impression that it has been “soured”\nintentionally and that it hasn't just turned “sour” through\nage or neglect.[<em>Norman R.
