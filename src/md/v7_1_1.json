By some, punning is\ncalled an art form; by others, a mental sickness. <em>Stedman's\nMedical Dictionary</em> lists an ailment known as <em>Witzelsucht</em>—\nliterally 'wit-seeking'—which is characterized by “a morbid\ntendency to pun and tell pointless stories while being inordinately\nentertained thereby.” No indication of the cause and\ntreatment is given, nor is it stated whether a cure is even\npossible.</p>\n<p>A long line of wags and wits have given the lie to the\nold adage that “The pun is the lowest form of wit” (“The\nbun is the lowest form of wheat”). Although there have\nbeen some low moments in the history of the pun, each play\non words must be judged on its own merits, for the proof is\nin the punning.</p>\n<p>Since Biblical times, the pun has been considered a valuable\nliterary device. In the sixteenth chapter of St. Matthew,\nJesus calls his disciple Peter (<em>petros</em>) and says of him\nthat upon this <em>rock</em> (<em>petra</em>) he will build his church. In the\nOld Testament, it is stated in the Book of Samuel that\nDavid shall not build a <em>house</em> ('temple') for Jehovah but\nJehovah shall build a <em>house</em> ('dynasty') for David.</p>\n<p>Aristotle, in <em>Rhetoric</em>, held that several forms of paranomasia,\nas puns were once called, might be permissible in\nelegant writing. But not all puns made by the Greeks approached\nelegance. A certain Philagius produced a book of\nwitticisms called <em>Laughter-loving</em> in which the following\nstory can be found:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A one-eyed doctor visiting a patient asked in salutation\n“How are you?” “As you see,” replied the patient.\n“Then,” said the physician, “if you are as I see, you are\nhalf-dead.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best known pun in classical literature can be found\nin the ninth book of Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>. Ulysses and his comrades\nhave been captured by Polyphemus, the one-eyed\ngiant to whom Ulysses gives his name as <em>Outis</em> ('No man').\nPolyphemus is later betrayed by this pun when Ulysses\nblinds him with a blazing pole and the giant, in his agony,\nyells, “No man has blinded me.” Polyphemus' brother giants\ntake him literally and ignore him while Ulysses escapes.</p>\n<p>Medieval literature is almost devoid of puns and even\nChaucer, for all his wit, was not addicted to this form.\nPetrarch, however, is accused of making endless puns on the\nname of his beloved Laura. With the revival of literature,�\nthe Renaissance brought a rebirth of punning. Rabelais\nfilled his <em>Gargantua and Pantagruel</em> with a plethora of\npuns—many of them ribald and unfortunately lost in the\ntranslation from French to English.</p>\n<p>By the 16th century, a school of punsters had arisen,\ncomprised chiefly of the best-known English dramatists:\nShakespeare, Jonson, Marlowe, Dekker, and Heywood. Unfortunately,\nthere was more quantity than quality to their\npunning, as can be deduced from a few lines of Thomas\nDekker's <em>The Shoemaker's Holiday</em> where double entendre\nchanges the object of a hunt from deer to women:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ROSE: Why do you stay and not pursue your game?<br>\nSYBIL: I'll hold my life, their hunting nags be lame.<br>\nHAMMON: A deer more dear is found within this place.<br>\nROSE: But not the deer, sir, which you had in chase.<br>\nHAMMON: I chased the deer, but this dear chaseth me.<br>\nROSE: The strangest hunting that ever I see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the art of punning, Shakespeare was great shakes\nand without peer. Molly Mahood, in <em>Shakespeare's Wordplay</em>,\nestimates that he used approximately 3000 puns in his\nplays. The manner in which his characters use puns lends\nsupport to the contention that the function of verbal wit is\nto afford a safe outlet for repressed impulses. Falstaff's impulse\nto be irrational provides a type of pointless punning.\nIn <em>Henry IV, Part 2</em>, he puns on the names of his soldiers.\nMouldy is told that it is time he were used; Shadow, that he\nwould make a cold soldier but would serve for summer; and\nWart, that he is a ragged wart. At his cohort Pistol, Falstaff\nbellows, “No more Pistol; I would not have you go off here.\nDischarge yourself of our company, Pistol.”</p>\n<p>A more subtle release of impulses can be found in Mercutio's\npunning in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NURSE: God ye good morrow, gentlemen.</p>\n<p>MERCUTIO: God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.</p>\n<p>NURSE: Is it good den?</p>\n<p>MERCUTIO: Tis no less. I tell you; for the bawdy hand\nof the dial is now upon the prick of noon.</p>\n<p>NURSE: Out upon you. What a man are you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both <em>den</em> and <em>dial</em> allude .to the time of day and the female\nsex organ. <em>Prick</em> alludes to the time of day and the male\norgan. Under the guise of giving Nurse the time, Mereutio is\nsuggesting a role in the hay.</p>\n<p>A pun sometimes attributed to Shakespeare was actually\nmade by Charles Dibdin, a British dramatist, and published\nas part of a poem in 1803. It is in the form of a punning\nepitaph on the death of Shakespeare's wife:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To melt the sad, make blithe the gay,<br>\nAnd Nature charm, Anne hath a way,<br>\nShe hath a way,<br>\nAnne Hathaway<br>\nTo breath delight Anne hath away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the dramatists of the Elizabethan age did not have\na monopoly on punning. Elizabeth herself joined the ranks\nof pun devotees when she remarked to one of her noblemen,\n“Ye may be burly, my Lord of Burleigh, but ye shall make\nless stir in my realm that the Lord of Leicester.”</p>\n<p>A rather neat but probably apocryphal pun is attributed\nto Sir Francis Drake who, reporting to Queen Elizabeth\nafter his defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, supposedly\nuttered only the Greek name for a well-known\naphrodisiac—<em>Cantharides</em> ('the Spanish fly').</p>\n<p>James I was a pun fancier and purportedly appointed\nfew members of his Privy Council who were not versed in\npunning. When Charles I took the throne, he bestowed\nupon Thomas Killigrew, the English dramatist and wit, the\ntitle of king's fool, or jester, and provided him with cap and\nbells so that he could joke without offense. Killigrew once\nboasted that he could make a pun on any subject. “Make\none on me,” said Charles. “But that I cannot do, your Majesty,”\nretorted Killigrew, “for the king is no subject.”</p>\n<p>A controversy flourished in the 18th century over the\nmerits of punning. Although history has exculpated Samuel\nJohnson from the remark that “A man who would perpetrate\na pun would have little hesitancy in picking a pocket,”\nhe was still no great proponent of the pun. An anecdote has\nit that Johnson, when confronted by Boswell's challenge\nthat his dislike of puns might be attributed to his inability to\nengage in this practice, roared at his accuser, “Sir, if I were\npunish-ed for every pun I shed, there would not be left a\npuny shred of my punnish head.”</p>\n<p>In his <em>Dictionary of the English Language</em>, Johnson defined\na punster as “a low wit who endeavors at reputation\nby double meaning.” Yet he was not above getting off a pun\nwhenever an opportunity arose. At the Library of St. Andrews,\nhe inquired whether they possessed a certain book.\n“No sir,” was the reply, “it's a very expensive book and\nbeyond our means.” “Oh,” said the doctor, alluding to the\ncustom of selling diplomas, “you'll probably get it by\ndegrees.”</p>\n<p>Joseph Addison, editor of <em>The Spectator</em>, also looked\nless than favorably upon a pun. He stated in an editorial\nthat “The seeds of punning are in the minds of all men;\nand, though they may be subdued by reason, reflection, and\ngood sense, they will be apt to shoot up in the greatest\ngenius that is not broken and cultivated by the rules of art.”</p>\n<p>Unlike Addison, Jonathan Swift defended the pun,\ndeclaring that “Punning is a talent which no man affects to\ndespise, but he that is without it.” In a tract on punning\nwhich Swift is purported to have written, seventy-nine rules\nof punning are listed which read like a manual of parliamentary\nprocedure. Rule five states that any man may pun\nanother man's puns about half an hour after he has made\nthem. According to the “Rule of Interruption,” it is lawful\nto interrupt a discourse of the most serious consequence with\na pun. The “Rule of Retaliation” obliges the individual, if\nanother man makes fifty puns, to return all or most of them\nin kind. By the “Rule of Concatenation,” a person should\nmake a string of puns as fast as possible so that nobody else\ncan put in a word until he has exhausted the subject. The\n“Rule of Alienation” might be the best means of bringing\npeace and harmony to the world. When people are disputing\nhotly on a subject, the punster is obliged to pick out the\nword that is causing the greatest disturbance and make a\npun on it. This, says the tract, has not only occasioned\npeace in private companies but has put a stop to hot wrangling\nin Parliaments and convocations which, otherwise,\nwould not so soon come to a resolution.</p>\n<p>One of Swift's allies in The Great Pun Debate was the\ndramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan, author of The Rivals,\nwho invented a fanciful origin for the pun in his poem <em>The\nOrigin of Punning from Plato's Symposiaks:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once on a Time in a Merry Mood<br>\nJove made a Pun of flesh and blood,<br>\nA double two face'd living creature<br>\nAndrogynes, of two-fold Nature<br>\nFor Back to Back with Single Skin<br>\nHe bound the Male and Female in<br>\nSo much alike so near the same<br>\nThey stuck as closely as their name<br>\nWhatever words the female spoke<br>\nThe male converted to a joke<br>\nSo in this form of man and wife<br>\nThey led a merry Punning life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One would not expect to find Napoleon Bonaparte\namong the ranks of 18th-century punsters, but authorities\ngive him credit for a pun made during his Italian campaign\nof 1796-97. To a lady who was amazed to find him so\nyoung, he replied “I am young today but tomorrow I shall\nhave Milan.” (<em>Mille ans</em>, in French, means 'a thousand\nyears').</p>\n<p>The first half of the 19th century has been called the\ngolden age of punning. In Britain it spawned a bevy of pundits\nwhose irreverence for the English language was unbounded.\nCharles Lamb, author of the <em>Essays of Elia</em>, and a\nfew friends were once seated in a comfortable drawing\nroom on a rainy night when a dog began to howl outside.\nOne of the group arose to let him in, but Lamb protested\nwith “Why begrudge him his whine and water?” When\nsomeone said to Lamb, “Make me a pun,” he replied “Upon\nwhat, sir?” Regarding those who were foe and against punning,\nLamb commented, “I never knew an enemy of puns\nwho was not an ill-natured man.”</p>\n<p>Two younger contemporaries of Lamb, Theodore Hook\nand Thomas Hood, were perhaps the most notorious\npunsters of all time. Hood, probably the first Englishman to\nmake a living solely from commercial humor, was a veritable\npunning machine who ground out puns with alarming\nfacility. His many volumes of poetry are riddled with puns\nwhich used to annoy his more serious readers. But he\ndefended himself with the couplet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However critics may take offense<br>\nA double meaning has a double sense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of his better puns can be found in verses from “Faithless\nSally Brown”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>His death which happened in his berth<br>\nAt forty-odd befell<br>\nThey went and told the sexton<br>\nAnd the sexton tolled the bell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and from “Faithless Nelly Grey”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ben Battle was a soldier bold,<br>\nAnd used to war's alarms;<br>\nBut a cannon ball took off his legs<br>\nSo he laid down his arms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Extolling a drink called Athel brose, made in the northern\npart of Scotland by pouring boiling water on oatmeal and\nadding some condiments. Hood wrote the following\nepigram:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Charmed with a drink which Highlanders compose,<br>\nA German traveller exclaimed with glee,<br>\n“Potztausend! sare, if dis is Athol Brose<br>\nHow goot der Athol Boetry must be!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Edgar Allan Poe once said of Thomas Hood that “during\nthe larger portion of his life, he seemed to breath only\nfor the purpose of perpetrating puns.” Describing the meeting\nof a man with a lion. Hood said, “The man ran off with\nall his might and the lion with all his mane.”</p>\n<p>Theodore Hook achieved success at an early age by\nwriting comic operas and spent a number of years as a man\nabout town, winning a foremost place in the world of\nfashion as well as startling the public by the audacity of his\npractical jokes. Hook's memory is associated with what\nWilliam Walsh called “the most audacious jest on record.”\nAs Governor of Mauritius, Hook ruled for five years before\nbeing accused of embezzling 12,000 pounds of public funds.\nHe was dismissed from his post and returned to England,\nwhere he told friends that his dismissal was “on account of a\ndisorder in my chest.” Neither Hood nor Hook was above\nusing any possible situation as an excuse to make a pun.\nHood said that an undertaker, who wanted to cremate his\nashes when he died, had become very solicitous of late\nbecause he was seeking to “urn a lively Hood.” Hook, not\nfar behind, spoke lightly of a “fit of coffin” and told of the\nbereaved widower who said at his wife's funeral that he was\ngoing on a black-burying party.” Of a man hanged at Newgate,\nHook said that “he had taken a drop too much,” and\nof a man murdering his mother in a garret, “he was above\ncommitting a crime.” A story is told about Hook and Hood\nstrolling one evening on the outskirts of London with their\nfriend Charles Mathews, the actor. Hood said to Hook,\n“They call us inseparables, but after all it's only natural that\nHook and eye [I] should go together.” Hook then suggested\nthat the two have a match to see who could make up the\nbest joke on the spur of the moment. They agreed that the\nloser would buy supper tor the group and Mathews was appointed\numpire. Scarcely were the terms agreed on when\nthey spied a sign board the owner of which, wishing to advertise\nthat he sold beer, had mistaken an a for an e and, instead\nof “Beer sold here” had written “Bear sold here.”\n“Aha,” said Hook, “I suppose that bear is his own bruin\n[brewin'].” Hook then went on to say that his rival might\nbeat him because he carried more than two faces under one\nHood. At that moment. Hood sighted a small house which\ndisplayed a sign reading “Beware the dog.” Discovering no\ndog, he scribbled on the sign, “Ware be the dog?” At this,\nMathews declared that he could not decide between two\nsuch horrible puns and that each should pay for his own\ndinner.</p>\n<p>Though Lamb, Hood, and Hook dominated 19th-century\npunning, there were other wags whose tales dogged\nthose of the better-known punmen. A Mr. Poole, author of\n<em>Paul Pry</em>, was also considered a clever wit. An actor named\nPriest was playing at a London theater and someone at the\nGarrick Club remarked that there were a great many men\nin the pit. “Probably clerks who've taken Priest's orders”\nquipped Poole, who once defined <em>dogmatism</em> as “Puppyism\ncome to maturity.”</p>\n<p>When asked if he could pun on the signs of the zodiac,\nthe dramatist Douglas Jerrold replied, “By Gemini, I can.”</p>\n<p>Sydney Smith quoted the anonymous teacher who\nrebuked a careless student for reading the word <em>patriarchs</em>\nas <em>partridges</em> with the scathing comment, “You are making\ngame of the patriarchs.”</p>\n<p>Byron also unleashed some biting puns such as the\nconclusion of his epitaph on the drunken carrier, John\nAdams:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The liquor he drank being too much for one<br>\nHe could not carry off, so he's now carrion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is commonly believed that the most laconic military\ndispatch was Julius Caesar's <em>Veni, vidi, vici</em> 'I came, I saw,\nI conquered,' but none could equal in brevity that attributed\nto Sir Charles Napier, a British officer fighting in India\nwho has figured in the capture of the Indian territory of\nScinde. His dispatch to the British War Office in London\ncontained only the Latin verb <em>peccavi</em>, meaning 'I have\nsinned' [Scinde]. Unfortunately this most perfect of puns\nbelongs not to Napier but to <em>Punch</em>, which printed the story\nin 1844.</p>\n<p>Some of the best puns in the English language have\nbeen made on names. At a tavern where he had been overcharged,\nSamuel Foote, the English dramatist and actor,\nasked his host “What's your name?” “Partridge, sir” was the\nreply. “Partridge!” returned Foote. “It should have been\nWoodcock by the length of your bill.”</p>\n<p>There is also the jest of Dr. Thomas Browne who, having\nunsuccessfully courted a lady, was challenged to drink\nher health and replied, “I have toasted her many years, but\nI cannot make her Browne so I'll toast her no longer.”</p>\n<p>When Dr. Barton Warren was informed that his acquaintance\nDr. Vowel was dead, he exclaimed, “What!\nVowel dead? Well thank heaven it was neither you nor I.”</p>\n<p>Moving back a century we find equally pun-gent lines\nin the epitaph of that eminent pun gentleman, Jonathan\nSwift, for the Earl of Kildare:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who killed Kildare?<br>\nWho dared Kildare to kill?<br>\nDeath killed Kildare,<br>\nWho dared kill whom he will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another pun which may or may not have been Swift's\nresulted from a visit by Swift's friend. Dr. Ash, to an inn\nsoon after the passing of an act for the protection of growing\ntimber. The doctor requested a waiter to help him off\nwith his coat but the man refused saying that it was a felony\nto strip an ash. Regardless of who made the pun, it is a fine\nexample of Swift wit.</p>\n<p>Another 18th-century joker commented on John Gay's\n<em>The Beggar's</em> Opera, produced by John Rich, that the production\n“made Rich gay and Gay rich.”</p>\n<p>The Scottish poet, Thomas Campbell, in his student\ndays in Glasgow, observed that Mr. Drum, the liquor\ndealer, and Mr. Fife, an apothecary, were next-door neighbors.\nThe apothecary displayed a sign in his window which\nstated “Ears pierced by A. Fife.” One night Campbell, with\nthe assistance of several schoolmates, placed a long wooden\nboard between the windows of the two shops bearing in\nlarge capital letters the Shakespearean line, “The spiritstirring\nDrum, the ear-piercing Fife.”</p>\n<p>Among the ranks of American punsters it is not surprising\nto find old Poor Richard himself, Ben Franklin. The\nbest-known pun attributed to Franklin was made during the\nsigning of the Declaration of Independence. John Hancock\naddressed his associates with the words “We must be unanimous;\nthere must be no pulling different ways; we must all\nhang together.” Franklin replied “We must indeed all hang\ntogether or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.”\nAnother Revolutionary pun was made by Mather Boyles, a\nTory Loyalist of New England. Because of his political\nviews, the American patriots posted a sentinel to keep him\nunder surveillance. Boyles, in return, called this sentinel his\n“Observe-a-tory.”</p>\n<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes was a noted practitioner of the\npun. His advice to financial speculators was “Put not your\ntrust in money but your money in trust.” He also wrote the\nfamous limerick about Henry Ward Beecher.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Reverend Henry Ward Beecher<br>\nCalled a hen a most elegant creature<br>\nThe hen pleased with that,<br>\nLaid an egg in his hat<br>\nAnd thus did the hen reward Beecher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the 1920s and '30s fate brought some of America's\nfinest wits together at the Algonquin Round Table in New\nYork whence issued forth a sally of clever puns. Franklin P.\nAdams's remark “Take care of your peonies and the dahlias\nwill take care of themselves” is a classic. George S. Kaufman\nonce groaned during a card game, “I'm being treydeuced.”\nAlexander Woolcott titled a book of theater\ncriticism <em>Enchanted Aisles</em>.</p>\n<p>Other American writers such as Peter de Vries, Clifton\nFadiman—who dubbed Debussy fans “Debussybodies”—\nChristopher Morley, and S.J. Perelman have favored the\npun. Morley, who defined a pun as 'language on vacation,'\nobserved two small wigs on stands in a wig shop and commented,\n“They're alike as toupees.”</p>\n<p>Perelman wrote some of Groucho Marx's best lines. In\nthe film <em>Horsefeathers</em>, a secretary who has been holding a\ncaller at bay in the anteroom warns Groucho that “Jennings\nis waxing wroth,” to which Groucho replies, “Tell Roth to\nwax Jennings for a while.”</p>\n<p>Groucho specialized in outrageous puns that stretched\nthe English language to its breaking point. He once advised\n“Don't conscience-stricken before they're hatched.” In the\noriginal stage version of <em>The Coconuts</em>, he introduced the\norchestra leader as follows: “This is Emanuel. I got him\nfrom Emanuel Training School. He's Emanuel like.” In the\nfilm <em>Animal Crackers</em>, Groucho, speaking about elephant\nhunting, remarked with characteristic zaniness, “In Africa\nthe tusks are too firmly rooted, but in Alabama the\nTuscaloosa.”</p>\n<p>James Joyce is the greatest wordsmith of all. His <em>Finnegans\nWake</em> contains upwards of 50,000 plays on words in\nmore than 12 languages. Some have quintuple layers and\ncan only be deciphered by trained experts. Although Joyce\nmade the pun arcane it belongs to the people and is meant\nto be immediately understood rather than deciphered.</p>\n<p>The pun is a subversive element which torpedoes any\nattempt to make a language too exact, too formal. It is a\npleasant reminder to us that language is not a cold, precision\ninstrument but a fascinating ragbag of delights and surprises.</p>",
