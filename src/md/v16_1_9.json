Most of the 130-odd\nsources are, quite naturally, UK in origin and persuasion,\nwith a fair sprinkling of US periodicals; others\nlooked at include Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Turkey,\nHong Kong, and France (for <em>The International\nHerald Tribune</em>).  Ayto writes well, and his Introduction\n(actually, to get fussy about it, Foreword or Preface)\nsets forth clearly the aims and purposes of this\ncollection of neologisms.  The selection of 1200 entries\nfor inclusion seems a bit esoteric, but the general structure\nof the work—entry word, part of speech, definition,\ncitation(s), and, in many cases, an explanatory\ncomment on the origin of the term, its etymology, and\nother information—is straightforward.</p>\n<p>Rather than skip through, picking up “showcase”\nentries throughout the book, I chose to read thoroughly\nthe first quarter (A-C) and remark on specific\nentries.  I have not commented on entries that are either\nentirely satisfactory or out of my ken.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>advance man</em> The definition given, 'someone who\nmakes arrangements for visits and appearances\nby an eminent person, and goes in advance to\nensure that they proceed smoothly...A word\nof US origin.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems too specific to American English [AE]\nspeakers who associate the designation with the circus\nand other entertainments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>amicus brief</em> '<em>American</em> a legal submission by someone\nwho is not party to a case but has an interest\nin its outcome...<em>Amicus</em> is Latin for “friend.” '</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This shortened form may be rare in British English\n[BE], but the term <em>amicus curiae</em>, literally 'friend\nof the court,' is well established in Britain, and the\netymological note could be misunderstood.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>appeal</em> '<em>noun</em> an act of appealing against something\nThe U.S. Ski Association board Sunday rejected\nMike Brown's appeal of his exclusion from the\nU.S. Ski Team.  <em>USA Today</em>\nThe..verb <em>appeal</em>..is very well established in\nAE...Not so widely recorded is the consequence\nof this..with the preposition of..\nwhere in BE one would expect <em>against</em>.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One would expect <em>against</em> in AE also for this\nsense, and the <em>of</em> can be attributed to journalese or\nsome other aberrant style.  <em>Appeal of</em> is used in standard\nAE in: 'The appeal of children and kittens is\nuniversal.'</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>arrestee</em> <em>'American</em> a person who has been arrested'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The citation is from the <em>Roanoke Times and\nWorld-News</em>, undoubtedly a redoubtable newspaper\nbut scarcely one I should have selected as typifying\nAE.  It sounded like a nonce usage to me till I found it\nin <em>The Random House Unabridged, Second Edition\n[RHDII]</em> with a date of 1840-50.  Notwithstanding, I\nshould not think it common enough to warrant occupying\nspace in this book.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>autocondimentation</em> 'seasoning one's own food with\npepper and salt at table'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Very likely a facetious coinage, this appeared in\nquotation marks (attributing an AE source) in <em>New\nScientist</em>, a British journal.  Like many of the entries,\nboth AE and BE—<em>autohagiography, awfulize, babushkaphobia,\nbabynap, bimbette</em>, etc.—this strikes\nme as a nonce word, not likely to be found around the\nhouse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>boffo</em> The only speculation about its etymology\ncited is Merriam-Webster's <em>12,000 Words</em>: “from\n<em>boffola</em>, a 'belly-laugh,' which in turn comes\nfrom <em>boff</em>, a 'belly-laugh,' 'gag,' 'hit,' perhaps\nbased on <em>'box office.'</em>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I prefer the suggestion in <em>RHDII</em> that it might\ncome from Italian <em>buffo</em>, French <em>bouffe</em> 'comic.'</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>bump</em> '(of an airline) to exclude (a passenger with\na booking) from an overbooked flight'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This might be new to BE but this sense of <em>bump</em>\nand, alas, the practice have been common in AE for\nyears and ought to have been so indicated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>cherry pick</em> <em>'verb, informal</em> to cream off the choicest\nitems ..  The metaphor of “cherries” as the\nmost desirable elements of something may be\nreminiscent of the “bowl of cherries” which life is\nproverbially not.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Close, but no cigar.  In America as well as in England,\na sweet (like ice cream) is often topped with\nwhipped cream on which is placed a maraschino\ncherry.  Some (younger) people often save the cherry to\neat last; people more advanced in age may be seen to\neat the cherry first, presumably on the theory that they\nmight not last long enough to finish the sweet.  To\nmany, the cherry is, indeed, the choicest part.  But the\nimage is colored, too, by the existence, in both AE and\nBE, of a type of light, mobile hydraulic crane provided\nwith a basket or platform enabling one to approach a\ntall structure (like an American ice-cream sundae)\nfrom above to pluck the cherry from the top.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>coconut</em> <em>or</em> <em>coconut head</em> <em>'noun, derogatory slang</em> a\nblack person who adopts white cultural characteristics\n..  The metaphor is based on the coconut's\nbrown exterior and white interior.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is an interesting one: the term in AE is <em>oreo</em>,\nafter the tradename of a dark double chocolate cookie\nwith white cream between, a confection not encountered\n(by me) in Britain.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>creative</em> '<em>adjective, euphemistic</em> going beyond conventional\nscope or legal limits ..  This new meaning\nof <em>creative</em>, with its implication of imaginative\nrule-bending for possibly disreputable\npurposes, appears to have been coined in the\nfield of accountancy .. , but has since widened\nits area of application considerably.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I should have thought that 'innovative' might have\nbeen a better gloss, and one must take account, too,\nthat it was originally (and still is for those who have\nany sensitivity for the word) cynically facetious.</p>\n<p>Aside from these comments, which are intended\nto be helpful, there is a great deal of interest to be\nfound in this book, considerably enhanced by Ayto's\ncomments.  For example,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>-cred</em> <em>combining form, slang</em> popular acceptance\namong the stated group</p>\n<p>This form started its career in the mid 1980s in\n<em>street-cred</em>, an abbreviation of <em>street credibility</em>\n—popular approval in urban working class culture—but\nnow is beginning to show signs of developing\ninto a buzz-suffix in its own right:</p>\n<p><em>force-cred</em></p>\n<p>All these qualities make him [Peter Imbert, Metropolitan\nPolice Commissioner] a copper's copper.\nHe has force-cred, and therefore is as well placed\nas anyone could be to make the Newman structural\nreforms actually work in practice.</p>\n<p><em>Guardian</em> 18 Mar 1988</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ayto's style is lively: in his comment on <em>cathart</em> he\noffers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This curiously curt coinage, based on <em>cathartic</em>, at\nleast has the merit of getting out of the usual humdrum\n-<em>ize</em> rut.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are (other) entries whose validity seems questionable\non the grounds that they, like some I have\nmentioned, are not likely to have sufficient frequency\nin the language to merit inclusion—<em>aestheticienne, affluenza,\nagitpop [sic]</em>, to mention a few.  The citations\nare shown to add explanatory information to the definitions\nas well as context, not, as in the <em>OED</em>, as attempts\nat establishing earliest recorded evidence.\nCompilers (and publishers) of such works would be\nwell advised to have any AE material thoroughly\nchecked by those in the know, for it is almost impossible\nto derive accurate information about a given dialect\nsave from those who are steeped in it.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
