I\noften felt as though I were alone, wandering through a desert.\nOnce in a while, however, I would come across an occasional\nword which sounded familiar, and I copied it in the\nback of my grammar book with a joyful feeling of “Whee!  A\nlandmark!”  Of course, obvious words such as those beginning\nwith <em>al-</em>, and others like <em>cotton, admiral</em>, and <em>saffron</em>\nwere no surprise.  <em>Cotton (cotón)</em> was an old friend from\nSpanish, <em>algodón; saffron's</em> ancestor was <em>safrún</em> 'yellow.'\n<em>Admiral</em>, I was delighted to find, comes from the poetic\nphrase <em>ámir albáhr</em> 'prince of the sea.'</p>\n<p>One of my first landmark words was <em>qitt</em> (masculine).\nThe feminine of <em>qitt is qítteh</em>, the literary word for—you\nguessed it—'cat.'  There also exists, in literary Arabic, <em>hirr</em>\n(masc.), <em>hírreh</em> (fem.), an onomatopoetic alternative.  These\nwords, however, are not understood by most of the people\none would meet in the <em>souq</em> 'marketplace,' who speak colloquial\nArabic.  The local word for cat is <em>bíssi</em>, (from <em>pussy</em>),\nwhich presumably arrived in our city with the British Mandate.\nThe cats of East Jerusalem, however, respond nicely to\nall three of these words.  (As an inveterate cat lover, my\nresearch in the subject has been rather extensive.)</p>\n<p>Other words were pure serendipity, one of which was\n<em>dáraba</em> 'to strike.'  The first thing that flashed through my\nmind was <em>drub</em>, as in “He received a good drubbing.”  Sure\nenough, when I looked it up in my English dictionary, there\nit was: “Arabic: <em>dáraba</em>.”  Under <em>tumbrel</em>, however, I found\nonly “a farmer's cart, especially a boxlike cart for carrying\nand dumping dung: Old French.”  I was inspired to look this\none up because of a word I came across in a third-year children's\nstory.  It was <em>túnbur</em>, which in the story referred to a\ngarbage collector's cart.</p>\n<p>The category consisting of words like <em>qitt</em> and <em>túnbur</em>\nleft me wondering if the relationship to similar words in\nIndo-European languages might not be a very ancient one.\nThe words for earth, for example.  One of these is \\?\\<em>ard</em>; the\nother is <em>túrbeh</em>, which gave me an image of turbid, muddy\nwater.  <em>Sáut</em> is 'voice which, when used in a certain manner,\nproduces a shout.'  By the same token, \\?\\<em>áwwal</em> translates to\n'howl.'  <em>Shout</em> is marked “Old Norwegian: skūta” in the dictionary,\nand <em>howl</em>, “Middle English: houlen.” <em>Silk</em>, too, is\ngiven an Old English origin <em>seolc</em>.  Yet the identical word in\nArabic means 'thread.' <em>Nod</em> seems to me to be an archetypical\nMiddle English word—yet here is <em>nad</em> (pronounced <em>nod</em>)\nin the Arabic lexicon in front of me, with the meaning\n'swing, oscillation.'  The Hebrew infinitive for <em>'swing'</em> is\n<em>lenadnéd</em>.</p>\n<p>There is no dearth of “eureka!”  words in Latin and its\nderivatives, either.  <em>Súmu w</em>, meaning 'height, elevation,'\ncomes too close to <em>summum</em> for comfort.  <em>Agile</em>, my English\ndictionary tells me, is a Latin-origin word meaning 'able to\nmove quickly and easily.'  Its Arabic counterpart is <em>ajaleh</em>\n'speed.'</p>\n<p>A French policeman carries a <em>matraque</em> 'nightstick'; the\nArabic <em>táraqa</em> means 'to hammer, knock,' and the Spanish\nfor 'bang-bang, bonk-bonk,' etc., is <em>trac-trac</em>.  Before leaving\nthe subject, there is the French <em>casser</em> 'to break'; in Arabic\n'to break' is <em>kásara</em>.</p>\n<p>There is one word which makes me think of the possibility\nthat, once in a while, there was an exchange of some\nsort.  The word is \\?\\<em>arsh</em> 'throne.'  It may be stretching it a bit,\nbut when I saw this word I stopped for a moment, and the\nfollowing scene took place in my imagination.  I pictured a\ndelegation from an exotic land, standing before the king of\nEngland, once upon a time, long ago.  The visitors marveled\nat the ornate throne, for their own king sat upon velvet\ncushions on an oriental rug.  One of the men whispered to a\ncourtier, “What is His Majesty sitting on?” and the answer\nhe received might have caused an Old English word to enter\nthe Arabic language.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
