Experienced compilers know the agony\nattached to headword selection and to comment on the ins\nand outs seems ungentlemanly.  But Professor Rosenberg\nstates in his preface that this reference book is intended for\n“the experienced person who demands precise information\n...and the newcomer, support member, teacher, or student\nwho seeks general explanations.”  Having so defined his target\nhis book becomes fair game for measuring the results against\nthe criteria.</p>\n<p>Titled <em>Dictionary of Business and Management</em>—I\nwonder if it shouldn't have been either <em>Dictionary for\nBusiness and Management</em> or <em>Dictionary of Business and\nManagement Terms</em>—it contains words like <em>experiment</em> and\n<em>fad</em>, which have here been defined in understandably general\nterms because of their remote business connotations and\nshould have relinquished their space to terms like <em>distribution\ncurve, microfiche</em>, and <em>nationalization</em>: all are missing and\neach has greater relevance to business.  The possible retort\nthat “you can't include everything” would be reasonable had\nthe unnecessary been excluded.</p>\n<p>There is a great deal of useful information derived from\na wide range of business activities.  No attempt has been made\nto provide all-encompassing definitions and quite right, too,\nsince the content is intended for business reference only.  Professor\nRosenberg has wisely not limited entries to single words\nbut has included two- and three-word phrases that have\nestablished themselves in commercial language.  He has also\nincorporated in the alphabetic body an occasional short encyclopedic\nentry for agencies or legislative acts that have interest\nfor the business community.  For instance, there are\nbrief statements, descriptive rather than narrowly defining,\non such subjects as the <em>Advertising Council, Equal Pay Act of\n1963, Railroad Retirement Act of 1935, Lloyds</em>, and <em>National\nMediation Board</em>.  But then, inexplicably, there is a chronological\nAppendix M at the back of the book of “Major Business\nand Economic Events in the U.S. 1776-1978,” which offers\nthe same kind of information about entirely different acts and\nevents, but with no indication of the content unless the reader\nscans the entire Appendix to learn what has there been included.\nHaving already included encyclopedic matter in the\nmain part of the book, why could not the author have incorporated\nthis Appendix into the A-Z section?</p>\n<p>The various other appendices are for the most part well\nselected and useful.  They cover equivalent measures, metric\nand English conversions, numerals, simple and compound interest\ntables, foreign currencies (mistitled “Foreign Exchange”),\nand schools having Graduate Business Study programs.\nAppendix L, a listing of quotations in one way or\nanother concerned with businessmen, business activities, or\nbusiness philosophy, is a bit of a curiosity.  It is arranged\nalphabetically according to author with a helpful cross-reference\nby subject.  But what is it doing in a dictionary?\nWhile much of it is delicious reading, why would someone\nlooking for information or definitions regard it as useful?\nMoreover, the publishers must have been so distracted by the\ncharm of these quotations that they failed to notice the running\nheads disappearing midway through this section and\nthen reappearing as “Appendix M” instead of “L.”</p>\n<p>The type selected for setting the book is unnecessarily\nlarge, resulting in a deplorable waste of space that might\notherwise have allowed for a reduced number of pages (with\na commensurate reduction in consumer cost) or an increase in\ncontent (with greater justification for the price).  At $24.95\nthe book just doesn't seem to be a good value.  That's a pity,\nbecause the opportunity to provide a truly worthwhile reference\nbook appears to have been missed by a margin slight\nenough to provoke regrets.</p>\n<p>The subject, however, merits attention, and for that reason\nalone I hope that this dictionary finds enough of a market\nto carry it to a second edition.  The publisher might then be\nwell advised to take steps to eliminate the shortcomings.</p>\n<p>Gerald J. Morse</p>\n<p><em>New York, New York</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
