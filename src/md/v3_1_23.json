Ross Eckler</span></h1>\n<p>Jon Mills asks [II, 4] for other words besides <em>facetious</em> which use vowels in sequence.  Besides the well-known <em>abstemious</em>, one can find <em>parecious, arsenious, acheilous, acheirous, bacterious, arterious, affectious, fracedinous, acleistous</em> and <em>annelidous</em> in <em>Webster's Second</em>. Is it possible to find a word with vowels in order that does not end in -<em>ous?</em>  I haven't found one in <em>Webster's</em> but <em>cacheticorum</em> and <em>arteriosum</em> are in <em>Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary</em>, and <em>conus arteriosus</em> is in <em>Webster's Third.</em></p>\n<p>The November 1968 and February 1970 issues of WORD WAYS, the Journal of Recreational Linguistics, generalized the AEIOU problem by asking for Websterian examples of words containing each of the 120 different possible orderings of the vowels.  Examples for 109 were eventually located--all but AEIUO, AUIEO, EAIUO, IAEUO, IAUEO, IEAUO, IUEOA, OAIEU, OAUEI, OEIAU and UIAEO), and the word <em>Milquetoast</em> (in <em>Webster's Third</em>) was subsequently found to fill one of these holes.</p>\n<p>Short well-known eight-letter words with the vowels each represented once are <em>dialogue</em> and <em>euphoria</em>.  Two seven-letter examples besides <em>sequoia</em>, are <em>moineau</em> and <em>miaoued</em>.  The French language has a fine six-letter example, <em>oiseau</em>.</p>\n<p>Mr. Mills also mentions the vowel-replacement problem, exemplified by <em>pack-peck-pick-pock-puck</em>.  Examples of these are so easy to find that WORD WAYS readers introduced the additional constraint of Y as a vowel.  In the August 1975 issue, Darryl Francis proposed <em>mathmeth-mith-moth-muth-myth: meth</em> is in <em>A Dictionary of New English</em> (1973), and the others are in <em>Webster's Third</em>.  In the November 1975 issue, several readers pointed out the examples <em>Dane-dene-dine-done-dune-dyne</em> (all in the <em>Penguin Dictionary of English</em>) and <em>pale-Pele-pilepole-pule-pyle</em> (all in the <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls College Dictionary</em>). <em>Mana-mane-mani-mano-Manu-many</em> can all be found in <em>Webster's Third</em>.  In the February 1976 issue, Dmitri Borgmann gives examples of from three to eight letters in length, but he must use obsolete words from the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> in the longer examples.  <em>[A. Ross Eckler, Morristown, New Jersey]</em></p>\n<p>[A general round of applause (one hand clapping) to those readers who sent in <em>abstemious</em>.  As for the vowel-sequence problem, it might be solved most neatly by a fast chorus of <em>Old MacDonald Had a Farm!</em>  This gives us the opportunity to call our readers' attention to the excellent quarterly periodical, WORD WAYS, published by Mr. Eckler.  WW is filled with word games, articles on some of the more recondite anomalies of language, and a great deal of linguistic acrobatics.  A sample issue is $2.00; a year's subscription, $8.00.  Address WORD WAYS, Spring Valley Road, Morristown, NJ 07960, and send remittance in full with your order.â€”<em>Editor [LU]</em>]</p>\n<h2></h2>",
