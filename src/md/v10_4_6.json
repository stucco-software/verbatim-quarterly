That is not to criticize the purely\npedagogical theory that there are certain words that one can\nexpect children of a given age to know.  But that is a matter of\n<em>analysis</em> of reading matter, not of writing.  If a child is\nfortunate enough to have intelligent parents who speak <em>their</em>\nlanguage to him (instead of some idiotic notion of how children\nuse language, i.e., babytalk), he will learn from them the words\nhe needs for communication.  In addition, and if he is less\nfortunate, he should, no, <em>must</em> acquire his vocabulary from\nreading and from watching TV programs like <em>Nature, Nova,\nNickelodeon,</em> and, for those who cannot yet read, <em>Sesame\nStreet</em>.  Teaching vocabulary is a silly enterprise when applied to\nchildren, and I have some doubts about its usefulness for\nadults.  When I was about eight or nine, I was given books like\n<em>The Earth for Sam, The Sky for Sam</em>, and <em>The Sea for Sam</em>,\nwhich I found fascinating.  In short order, words like <em>Tyrannosaurus\nRex, nova, Horsehead Nebula, paleolithic,</em> and dozens of\nothers became familiar friends, though I had some difficulty in\nsteering conversations with my contemporaries to topics that\nallowed me to exercise that kind of word stock.</p>\n<p>There were, of course, many other books that yielded up\ntheir verbal treasures.  Children tend, naturally, to acquire the\nvocabularies of the subject areas that interest them: ten-year-olds\ninterested in computers, or astronomy, or baseball, or\nphilately will quickly become familiar, on their own, with the\nwords and concepts associated with those subjects.  It is (partly)\nthe function of education to broaden the base, so to speak, to\nacquaint them with subjects they have not or might not have\notherwise encountered.  Some of those are “academic,” in the\nsense that one does not, in the normal course of events,\nencounter much American history or geometry in everyday life,\nnor does the average person have access to the chemistry\nlaboratories or the powerful microscopes that are met with\nwhen pursuing a general high-school curriculum.  “Academic”\neducation has its purpose in acquainting students with the sort\nof basic knowledge they might be likely to need just to get by\nin the modern world; only in a secondary sense does it\nacquaint them with the kinds of options that they might\nexplore to fulfill their lives.  Thus, if one never learns what a\nbiologist or astronomer or anthropologist does, how can one\nchoose to become any of those?  In today's specialized world,\nwhere choices of career abound, students are sore put to learn\nall or even many of the options open to them, options that may\nwell coincide with their talents and interests.</p>\n<p>Having delivered myself of that polemic, I'd best return to\n<em>Wally the Wordworm</em>.  To many of us in the minority—that is,\nthose born before 1940—Clifton Fadiman is known as the\nincisive host of a long-running radio show, <em>Information, Please,</em>\npeopled by experts like Franklin P. Adams, Oscar Levant, and\nother well-informed bodies who spontaneously answered questions\nsent in by listeners.  If they failed to answer correctly, the\nquestioner received a set of the <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>.  It\nhas always been my impression that few <em>EBs</em> were sent out,\nowing to the brilliance of the experts.  More recently, Kip\nFadiman has been on the board of the Book-of-the-Month\nClub, for more years than I can count.  <em>Wally</em> was first\npublished in 1964; the present edition, enlivened by sparkling\nillustrations by Lisa Atherton, is a welcome and refreshing\naddition to the welter of books for children, and it shouldn't be\nallowed to go out of print again.  Fadiman's point is that words\nare fun.  He “hated books for children in which the words were\nsupposed to suit their age, so that they'd never come across a\nword too 'hard' for them.”  (From the Foreword.)</p>\n<p>Wally the Wordworm is a bookworm with an insatiable\nappetite for words: he not only loves dictionaries, he simply\neats them up.  In his gastronomic peregrinations, he encounters\n(and ingests) words like <em>voracious, abracadabra, palindrome</em>\n(where he stops for a post-prandial pause to consider <em>madam,\ndeified,</em> and other examples of the genre), <em>safari, alligator,</em> and\nmany other verbal delights.  The presentation of these words\nvaries from outright encounter to puns, analogies, spelling\ncuriosities, and other funomena.</p>\n<p>If you have (or are, or know) a child, buy this book, a joy\nto the eye, the mind, and the spirit.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
