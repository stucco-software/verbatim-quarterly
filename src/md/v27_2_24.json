We need one precisely defined set of letters to constitute its reversal, which may not be a word, so that probability of finding such a word is the number of words of that length divided by the number of possible letter sequences.” (from <em>Word Ways; The Journal of Recreational Linguistics</em> 31/4 [November 1998] “Reversible Heterograms” by Rex Gooch). The afterword is by Richard Lederer, a VERBATIM contributor (and wildly successful word writer) both early and late.</p>\n<p>Morice himself works with <em>Word Ways,</em> and has often been featured on National Public Radio in the States. This dictionary, which has what must be a completely non-coincidental total of 1,234 entries is definitely worth having. I feel I could assign a VERBATIM article out of every entry (well, every entry that doesn't have as an example something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TEE (9 +13 + 13 = 35)</p>\n<p>QUIZZICAL (.4 + 3.3 = 7.3 = 0.1 + 0.1 + 7.3 +</p>\n<p>3.5 + 8.5 + 4.5 = 35)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>as <em>sumgram</em> 'two or more words whose letters have sumword values that add up to the same amount' does).</p>\n<p>The book is made more useful still by the index to the dictionary that gives sources and authors for the concepts defined and by a great bibliography.</p>\n<p>This is a valuable addition to any word-lover's reference shelf, and these friendly, straightforward definitions should encourage readers (especially those with calculators, or even better, computer programming experience) to become better wordplayers, or to jump in where before they had been holding back. I, for one, will be looking for <em>hidden middle names,</em> like the one found in HORATIO NELSON.</p>\n<p>—<em>Erin McKean</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
