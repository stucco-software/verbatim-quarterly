The <em>Shorter OED</em> dates the use of <em>dickey</em> as a slang or colloquial term for 'sorry, poor, unsound' to 1812 and suggests it might have originated in the phrase, “as queer as Dick's hatband.” Whatever its origin I can personally vouch for its continued usage, for I am reminded of it wherever I go. For years I have endured, with a forced smile, “original” jokes about “looking rather dickey this morning,” and “feeling a little dickey,” with its double entendre, is even worse. However, my sense of humour was severely tested on a visit to my brother in Australia a few years ago. Obliged to attend a Perth hospital, owing to temporary problems with what Monty Python dubbed “the naughty bits,” I was mortified to hear members of the medical staff referring to my case, with obvious glee and in decidedly unmedical terms, as “Dickie's dickey dickey.” It is no wonder my brother has since changed his name to Snow.</p>\n<p><em>[Robert M.
