Waugh has drawn the attention of your\nreaders to the lack of any single word in the English language\nother than <em>fart</em> for the 'passage of rectal flatus.'  Members of\nthe medical profession frequently encounter difficulty in\nmaking their meaning clear to patients without causing embarrassment\nwhen enquiring about this aspect of bowel function,\nand both parties tend to use circumlocutory expressions\nwhich are capable of being misunderstood.</p>\n<p>Most of the bodily functions can be described by words\nsuited to polite society or physiological terminology: for example,\n<em>eructate, masticate, sternutate, micturate, defaecate\n(defecate), copulate</em>.  But there is no corresponding word for\n<em>fart</em>, which remains taboo with a large proportion of the population.\nIn my lecture to the Listerian Society at this hospital\non 30th April 1974, I proposed that the act of passing rectal\nflatus should be termed “deflatulate” in its verbal form, when\na single word was needed in circumstances unsuited to the\nmonosyllabic alternative.  “Deflatulate” is self-explanatory\nand is in the same series as those in the above-mentioned list,\nand I suggest it be adopted for general usage.  As a matter of\nhistorical interest, the obsolete <em>crepitate</em> was used in the 19th\ncentury, but the term did not specify whether the gas being\ndischarged was gastric or rectal.</p>\n<p><em>[Dr. Bernard J.
