Shipley, (Philosophical Library, 1945), x + 430pp and Peter Davies, (McGraw-Hill, 1981), vii + 216pp.</p>\n<p>The old and the tired and the revived Shipley's <em>Dictionary\nof Word Origins</em> (1945) has been reissued.  Why?  It is a ragbag\nof uninformation (<em>aard-vark</em> contains Dutch 'pig,' unexplained),\nmisinformation (<em>grammar</em> from a root <em>gra</em>-; total ignorance of\nlaws of phonetic change, e.g., for <em>four, seven, eight, ten</em>, and\nthe fictitious Latin <em>pinque</em> under the headword <em>number; sneeze</em>\nfrom <em>fnese</em> is a misprint!), jumbled information (e.g., <em>college</em>\nand <em>grave</em>, which read like free-association transcripts,)<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a1\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup> garbled\ninformation (<em>havoc</em> 'plunder' &lt; Old French <em>havot</em> &lt; German\n<em>Haft</em> to Latin <em>capt</em>-, somehow bringing in <em>hawk</em>), and the\ngoddamnedest information (<em>yellow...gelb...chloros</em>... fool\n...love...German women of pleasure...lust...<em>gooseberry\nfool</em>...custard—what next?).  I mustn't take more of your\ntime.  Quick!  To your most indispensable entry: <em>Harpocrates</em>\n“The Gr. god of silence.”  And then the epigraph to this book:\n“his cult is forgotten today.”</p>\n<p>Peter Davies's <em>Roots</em> (1981) is an entirely different kettle\nof trout (see 4, 144, and below).  I will have some adverse\nthings to say, but we must welcome this as a real step in the\nmodern world on our slow climb back up to a state of literacy\nand decently exact knowledge.  If enough copies of such books\n(suitably revised) were distributed, we might even end up with\na high school that taught something, and a better than\naccidental crop of literate college graduates.</p>\n<p><em>Roots</em> is really a rather old-style book, rewarmed,\nrearranged, and cosmeticized.  It is inspired by the same\ninstincts as Otto Schrader's <em>Die Indogermanen</em> (Leipzig, 1911;\nrevised by H. Krahe, 1935), and they are good instincts—to\ndistill the truth about Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans\nand to disseminate it broadly—and this aim has been leveled at\nthe lexicon of English.  Davies has been bitten by the Indo-European\nbug (1—7).  If I carp, it must be clearly understood\nthat I applaud his enthusiasm, his perception of important\nthings, his energy in carrying out a plan, his very real respect\nfor the use of 2 learning and technical knowledge.  It is therefore\na bit disappointing to find that half of his argument on pp. 2—3\nand 6—7 regrinds the flour of Bloomfield, <em>Language</em> (1933)\n319-20 § 18.14. 3  But, although Davies wants us to glory in our\nIndo-European heritage (dictionary or no), the main lesson of\nhis book is that our language has two principal sources, the\ninherited IE and the borrowed-ultimately IE.  The big theoretical\npoint, of course, is that this dichotomy is a fallacy: The\nborrowed component comes in, and speakers are unaware\nwhether it was born branded IE or not.  Even more, if we had\nstarted growing our learned stock in Avicenna, we would\nprobably now be cheerfully expanding productively among\nArabic broken plurals and participles, but the chances of\nhistory simply decreed otherwise.  So we have little Old Latin\nand Greek and Indo-European.</p>\n<p>Davies revels (3—4) in <em>hound</em> and <em>canine</em>, in <em>naked</em> and\n<em>nude</em>.  This is old news, but it is good news.  He calls (4) this\nduality “a significant and little-noticed theme.”  I wasn't aware\nof that.  I thought it was one of the most noticed and most\nmisstated items in our culture and in our books.</p>\n<p>I say, let us accept the platitude Mr. Davies discovers for\nus, let us refine and sift his formulations, let us overcome our\nsoporific publishers, let us drown the scummy crap in our\npublic schools and their texts, let us annex the élan of Peter\nDavies.</p>\n<p>Davies's method is a simple bipartite one: For about 100\nIE etyma, the discursive history and diagramed family tree are\ngiven on facing pages to show the modern outcomes of a given\ninherited IE form and of its cousin forms inherited by other IE\nbranches (Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, etc.), then borrowed from\nthem by English.  Thus you see in diagrams and words the twin\nhistories from the same IE source (e.g,. *<em>bhrāter</em>) of native\nEnglish <em>brother</em> and borrowed (Latin) <em>fraternal, fraternity</em>, (Old\nFrench) <em>friar</em>, and (Gypsy) <em>pal</em>.  This is interesting stuff, and it\ndeserves publicizing, but there is a distortion here, which <em>pal</em>\nwell illustrates.  Romany is indeed IE and it is true that\n*<em>bhrāter</em>- &gt; <em>pral</em> &gt; <em>pal</em> &gt; English argot, but Romany is no\nless exotic and no more a natural relative and source than\nEastern New England Algonquian, which contributed <em>skunk</em>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is a technical difficulty here.  These etymologies\nmust be absolutely accurate.  I do not mean to be\nharsh on Davies; they need not be <em>exhaustive</em>, but they lose\ntheir point without <em>exactitude</em>.  The Germanic descent must be\ncorrect (*<em>apoter</em>- will not give *<em>aftar</em>- directly).  Even small,\nnondamaging detail should be observed: The Germanic ancestor\nof <em>corn</em>, etc., should not be given with -<em>m</em> (*<em>kurnam</em>), as if\nidentical with Latin (<em>grānum</em>).  In Classical philology and\nlinguistics, the derivation of the Latin cognates sometimes\nimposes difficulties of a major order: the deviant vocalism of\nLatin <em>magnus, 4 maximus</em> or of <em>frangere</em> under the roots *<em>meg</em>-and\n*<em>bhreg</em>-, or the problematic <em>s</em>- of Latin <em>super</em> to the root\n*<em>uper</em>.  Numerous points of detail could be raised.5  Not all of\nthese are trivial, but it is not my purpose here to grade the\neffect or damage resulting from errors of different magnitudes.\nMy point is that we <em>can</em> be accurate and principled; etymology\nis no less orderly, as a subject, than chemistry, though sadly it\nis often practised as an amateurish and less serious discipline.\nIn etymology we can and do get results, and the world should\nknow this.  <em>Roots</em> has too many errors, great or small, and so do\nits sources, nostra culpa.</p>\n<p>There is a grave flaw in the principles of the stemma\ndiagrams: Branches for separate etyma of a single dialectgroup,\nusually Germanic (e.g., *<em>af</em> 'off' and *<em>after</em>- 'after') are\ntwigged improperly off the same node as other, quite different\ndialect-groups (e.g., Latin <em>ab</em> and Greek <em>apo</em>).  This is a gross\ngenetic error in this form of representation.6</p>\n<p>Now to the sermon.  What is all this useful for, and why\nshould we be deadly accurate?  I say, because it can make a\nbetter world and, with good will, could clean up our high\nschools mightily.  There is a natural curiosity about language,\none's own language.  Let us exploit it.  Etymology is precise and\ngets results—when done with an engineer's or logician's precision.\nThey say we Americans can't market automobiles and\nmachinery; our products are slovenly, our controls lax.  I\nshouldn't be surprised when one considers how little of accurate\nknowledge (e.g., in geography or composition) our schools\nimpart today and how low the demand on students' skill really\nis.  I say in all earnestness that historical linguistics and\netymology, rightly practised, have a vital lesson to teach.</p>\n<p><em>[Eric P.
