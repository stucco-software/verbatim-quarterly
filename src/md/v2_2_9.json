So far, I\nfelt confirmed in my prejudices.  But then, searching\nfurther, I found that a surprising 30% have various\nintermediate senses, some strikingly close in function\nto Classical Greek “middle voice” participles.  Examples\nfollow, in order of decreasing passivity.</p>\n<p><em>amputee:</em> one who has had a limb or limbs amputated\n(voluntarily or involuntarily)</p>\n<p><em>referee:</em> one to whom disputes are referred</p>\n<p><em>mortgagee:</em> one who has mortgaged his assets or whose\nassets have been mortgaged for him</p>\n<p><em>divorcee:</em> one who has divorced a spouse or been divorced\nby a spouse</p>\n<p><em>absentee:</em> one who is absent, whether self-absented or not</p>\n<p><em>standee:</em> one who is compelled to stand (either by an\nusher or by lack of seats)</p>\n<p><em>refugee:</em> one who has taken flight or found refuge</p>\n<p>My assessment of -<em>ee</em> participials seemed not to\nhave been far off the mark.  However, when it came\ntime to check my more active term <em>conferent</em> (modeled,\nI suppose, on words like <em>adherent</em> or <em>celebrant</em>),\nI got a shock.  For even the prestigiously unabridged\n<em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> declined to admit <em>conferent</em>\nas a noun and cited it adjectivally only, with the\nmeaning 'appropriate' (as in the case of a remedy for\na disease).  Then, to compound my chagrin, the <em>OED</em>\nadded that <em>conferent</em> was obsolete—and had been\nsince the 16th century!</p>\n<p>I conclude that, as a teacher, I should stick to\nChaucer and the Venerable Bede.  In matters of current\nusage, I am clearly a learnee.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
