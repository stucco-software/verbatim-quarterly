And since\neveryone today is doing his own thing, there is a crying need\nfor pithy periodicals to suit every literary taste.  Here is a suggested\nlist for an enterprising publisher in search of untapped\naudiences:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>It</em>—for the nostalgic Clara Bow buff.</p>\n<p><em>I</em>—for the egocentric ophthalmologist.</p>\n<p><em>Dese, Dem and Dose</em>—for the Chicago Ward Committeeman.\n(Da Mare, Editor)</p>\n<p><em>Y'awl</em>—for the Southern yachtsman.</p>\n<p><em>Which</em>—for the lecherous warlock.</p>\n<p><em>His and Hers</em>—for the hotel towel collector.</p>\n<p><em>Thou Art</em>—for the Quaker painter.</p>\n<p><em>Cosa Nostra</em>—for the quiet Don.</p>\n<p><em>Hic, Haec, Hoc</em>—for the Latin hiccuper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And there is one little title I'm saving for myself.  I plan to put\nout a quarterly devoted to the members of the gentler sex who\ngive themselves unselfishly to male needs and desires.  I shall\ncall it <em>The League of Women Votres</em>.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
