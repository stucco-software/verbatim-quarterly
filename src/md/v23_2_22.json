A couple of observations in the review, whether Strauss's or Mertvago's, strike me as dubious at best and the translation of an example as misleading.</p>\n<p>I do not agree that “the relative brevity of many Russian proverbs stems from the fact that the Russian language has no articles and also resorts idiomatically to 'participial condensation' by not using oblique forms of the verb to be.” What about <em>byvshii</em> 'having been' and <em>budushchii</em>, the future participle of the Russian verb for 'to be'? No, the form of the Russian verb for 'to be' that is usually (but not always) omitted is the present tense, as sometimes in English: <em>Terrific guy, that Tom!</em> This omission and the absence of articles does lend a certain pithiness to Russian proverbs. But I think that the apparent brevity, which depends in part on whether you count words or syllables, is due much more to the heavy inflection of Russian that compresses meaning in single words. The best example of this kind of semantic compression that occurs to me is from Latin, a language that in many respects is grammatically similar to Russian: <em>Romae romane</em>, which comes to us in English as 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do.' In Russian I can squeeze this down to <em>V Ryme-po-rymski</em>. But then in English one can come pretty close to both the Latin meaning and brevity with, say, “In Rome, act (or be) Roman.” Running English proverbs and sayings through my mind, I seem to find that although our language has the resources to be fairly pithy, we are not as attracted to pithiness as Russians and Romans.</p>\n<p>What bothers me more, however, is the translation of the Russian proverb <em>Chemu Vanya nye nauchilsya, tovo Ivan nye vyuchit</em>. Literally, leaving out the <em>tovo</em> as redundant in English, this proverb means 'What Johnnie hasn't learnt, John won't learn.' Just as in English the nickname <em>Johnnie</em> implies youth, so the Russian nickname <em>Vanya</em> implies boyhood—but only implies: Uncle Vanya was not young—while the formal names <em>John/Ivan</em> imply maturity. By overloading the proverb with “little” and “old” in “What little Johnnie hasn't learnt, old John will not learn,” the translator (here a traditore, indeed) has killed the clever implication inherent in the play on names, perhaps in a fumbled attempt to bear out his claim that Russian proverbs are relatively brief.</p>\n<p>Maybe I am nitpicking, though. The statement that “Generally speaking, the Russians make greater use of proverbs than the Americans or the British” is doubtless true, with the consequence that the careful attention given Mertvago's compilation is quite justified.</p>\n<p>As for me, I hope that my nitpicking through the articles you publish in VERBATIM demonstrates the consideration I think due these articles rather than envy and pedantry.</p>\n<p><em>[William H.
