Camels are not native to Australia,\nbut in desert areas they have become as much part of\nthe landscape as kangaroos.  The word <em>hooshtah</em> 'a shout of\nencouragement to a camel' might now, in its English use, be\ncalled an Australianism, since all the <em>Oxford English\nDictionary's</em> recent quotations to illustrate the use of the\nword are from Australian sources.  Australia is now the only\nplace where camels run wild and the only source from\nwhich other countries can replenish their stocks.  In 1975\nsixty-five Aussie camels even emigrated to the USA.  They\nrequired no work permits, as they were destined to provide\ndisease-free stock for zoos.</p>\n<p>There were desultory attempts to bring camels to Australia\nas early as 1840, but it was not till the 1860s that large\nshipments were brought in from India.  With them came\ndrivers collectively referred to as <em>Afghans</em>.  Most were from\nAfghanistan, some from Rajasthan, Baluchistan, West Pakistan,\na few from Egypt, Iran, and Turkey.  All were Muslims\nand spoke Pashtu.  Besides providing outback transport for\nexplorers and goldfields, they were employed in building the\nrabbit-proof fence in Western Australia and the Overland\nTelegraph Line from Adelaide to Darwin.  They did not\nbring women and could not, in accordance with the prejudices\nof the time, become British citizens, so few remain;\nbut their collective name, shortened to <em>Ghan</em>, survives in the\nhistorical term <em>Ghan towns</em>, Afghan settlements on the outskirts\nof some inland towns, and, especially, in the name of\nthe train, the <em>Ghan</em>, that runs from Adelaide via Port Pirie\nto Alice Springs.  The old Ghan was subject to many delays\nas lines were washed out by floods, so that a train could easily\nbe two weeks late in arriving at its destination.  By 1980,\na new and more reliable standard-gauge line was completed,\nbut the name <em>Ghan</em> survives for the train.</p>\n<p>No new name for camels was needed to sell them.\nAcross the Tasman in New Zealand, however, export industries\nare aided by a little linguistic engineering.  Two well-known\nNew Zealand exports, neither of them native, are\ntree-tomatoes and Chinese gooseberries, but neither is called\nthat by the exporters.  The tomatoes are a South American\nfruit, a rich source of vitamin C and long popular in New\nZealand.  About twenty years ago, the name <em>tamarillo</em> was\ndeliberately contrived, much as a brand name is.  On the\nbasis of <em>tomato</em>, a diminutive <em>-ill-</em> was added; then <em>tomatillo</em>\nwas altered, in honor of a legendary Maori tribal hero,\nTama-te-kapua, to <em>tamatillo</em>; and then a change to\n<em>tamarillo</em> was considered more euphonious.  And so a new\nword was born.</p>\n<p>At about the same time, an export market for Chinese\ngooseberries was growing in the United States.  The trouble\nwas that at that time China was not popular in the USA.\nThe invention <em>kiwi-fruit</em> proved more acceptable, and a\nthriving industry perhaps owes much of its success to the linguistic\nartifact.  But perhaps in the new international climate\ngrowers will want to change the name back againâ€”or\ntry to sell their Chinese gooseberries to China.</p>",
