<p>In my smalltown community, some friends used to have a
pekipoo named <em>Mentsh</em> 'Fine Person.'  Others have a miniature
poodle that for years has appeared in their “Season's
Greetings” family pictures as <em>Shana Maydellah</em> [<em>sheyne
meydele</em> 'pretty little girl'].  I was not unprepared when a
canine puppet on TV's <em>Sesame Street</em> was called <em>Farfel</em> 'bits of
noodle' or when race horses were discovered with playful
Yiddish tags.  According to the <em>Jewish Digest</em>, a horse that ran
in 1967 was <em>Nisht Amool</em> [<em>nisht a mol</em> 'not sometime' now!].
In at least one case a vulgar appellation <em>Alter Kocker [Alter
Kaker</em> 'Old Crapper,' commonly euphemized bilingually as
<em>A.K.</em> or (since about 1960) “Alter Coyote” caused disqualification
of the nag until his name was changed.</p>
<p>Boats, too, have been treated to Yiddish monickers.  There
was in 1970 (and may still be) in Black Rock Harbor off
Bridgeport, Connecticut, a boat named <em>Mahia [mechaye</em> 'pleasure']
and another (owned by a Gentile), <em>L'Chayim</em> 'To Life.'</p>
<p>On other levels, announcers on WWDB FM radio in
Philadelphia have given billing to a psychologist as “Murray
Needelman with his hour of <em>tsuris</em> [var. of <em>tsores</em> 'troubles']”;
and New York Republican Paul Slotkin in his campaign for
Congress used the slogan “Don't Plotz [<em>plats</em> 'explode'], Vote
Slots.”  In further bilingual fun, Lucille Ball on an old Jack
Benny TV show (rerun Sept. 24, 1981) dubbed lumbering John
Wayne “El Klutzo” [<em>kluhts</em>, var. of <em>klots</em> 'log'].  Abigail van
Buren in 1980 referred to the man who sorts her Dear Abby
mail as her “faithful Jewish 'schleppercaun' ” [<em>shlepper</em> 'lugger,
tramp'].</p>
<p>As we're told in the McDavid edition of Mencken's <em>The
American Language</em> (1963), a Chinese Noshery [<em>nasheray</em>
'snackables'] was established c. 1955 in the nation's capital.
What do you suppose the New York catering service specializing
in kosher Chinese food is named?  Shang-Chail In Philadelphia
a restaurant offering kosher Italian cuisine is (what else?)
The Kosher Noshtra.  (These are reminiscent of the joke
recently quoted in VERBATIM about the mixture of Manischewitz
wine and tomato juice, an “Oyvay [<em>oy vey</em> 'woe is
me'] Maria.”  Last year I met a woman from an Italian Catholic
family who is married to a Jew; she told me, “He's a <em>Litvak</em>
[Jew of Lithuanian origin], and I'm a Litwop.”)</p>
<p>In the twenties and thirties, Jewish high-school students
used to clown around with nonsense French and Yiddish:
“Chevrolet coupe,/ a vu tut dir vey?  [.../'where does it hurt
you?'].”  Today, as mature adults, such persons have been heard
to comment tolerantly, “Chacun à son mishugas ['wackiness']”
or to exclaim critically, “Quel chutzpa [<em>chutspe</em> 'gall']!” or to
inquire smilingly of a new acquaintance, “Qu'est-ce que c'est
dayn chazer'she ['your filthy' lit., 'swinish'] business?”  There's
of course a New York eatery named Bagel Delox, and it may be
pertinent that Mimi Sheraton, food critic of <em>The New York
Times</em>, on Aug. 31, 1976 described the service at most bagel
restaurants in New York as “haute schlock” [<em>shlak</em> 'stroke,'
hence 'disaster,' 'junk'; <em>schlacht</em> 'slaughter'; <em>shlogn</em> 'to hit'] 
without quotation marks or italics.</p>
<p>The students who used to spoof Spanish with Yiddish in
“Vi est a qui una mesa?”  [<em>Vi est a ki</em> (var. of <em>ku) on a meser?</em>
'How does a cow eat without a knife?'] now quip about the
Mexican woman who serves her Jewish husband “enchilatkes”
[<em>latkes</em> 'pancakes'].  Moreover, the old Latin-Yiddish conjugation
<em>amo, amas, amat, a mames, a tates, a kind</em> '...a mother's and
father's child' has been followed by modern twists on Latin,
like the line from a wag in my family about the girl who checks
her suitor's astrological sign and finds that it is <em>Tsores</em>.  (Interestingly
enough, a Latin-Yiddish term appears in American black
slang: <em>mater mazuma [mezumen</em> 'ready cash'] 'female college
teacher,' reported in 1970 from southern black college student
use of the 1940s.)</p>
<p>Reportedly, Jewish residents of Hawaii have been known
to welcome visitors with “Alohaleichem” [<em>aloha</em> combined with
the greeting <em>sholem aleichem</em> 'peace be with you'].  And comic
strips have shown bilingually named personalities like the
plastic surgeon Dr. Poonim [<em>punim</em>, var. of <em>ponim</em> 'face'], the
matchmaking mother Ma Zeltov [<em>mazel tov</em> 'good luck, congratulations'],
and various others.</p>
<p>Especially fascinating have been the word-playing antics
in Sid Caesar's TV skits over the years.  Witness his Japanese
characters <em>Gantse Mishpūchah [gantse mishpuche</em> (var. of
<em>mishpoche)</em> 'whole clan']; <em>Taka Mitziah [takeh, matsie\?\ 'really,</em> 'really,
bargain'; presumably a further play on the name of Japanese
composer Takemitsu]; <em>Shmatsay [shmatte</em> 'rag']; or Princess
<em>Tushy Tushy</em> [bilingual children's diminutive (recorded in 1962
as <em>tushie</em>), from <em>tuchas</em>, var. of <em>toches</em> 'rump,' these being
sources of English <em>tochas, tuchas, tuckis, tookis, tukis</em> (and the
comment <em>tough tukis</em> 'tough luck,' dating to the 1960s), <em>tokis,
tokus, dokus</em>, and possibly of both the underworld term for a
'lifer,' <em>tocker</em> (he sits on his rump), and the British terms for
'administering or receiving a thrashing,' <em>give</em> (or <em>get</em> or <em>catch)</em>
<em>toco or toks</em>].  Author Sol Weinstein, in his parodies of mystery
fiction, probably paved the way for Caesar's writers with his
war between Israel and TUSH the Terrorist Union for Suppressing
Hebrews!</p>
<p>It may not be too surprising that a Miss Tushy beauty
contest was mentioned in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> May 31, 1982,
as a project of a bar near the L. A. airport, or that syndicated
columnist Earl Wilson on April 16, 1982, concluded his
remarks on the shapeliness of Pia Zadora with these words:
“Indeed, said the photographer, Pia's derriere will out-tushy
Bardot's.”  Most striking is the annual Miss Tush of the Year
pageant, inaugurated in 1979 by a California women's apparel
shop with outlets in Hermosa Beach and San Pedro.  The name
of the shop?  The Tushery!</p>
<p>The colorful alphabetical expressions of Jewish Americans,
first recorded in the 1940s, persist and grow.  Although these
have included alphabetizing of English (M.O.T. 'Member of the
Tribe' and the more recent <em>J.A.P.</em> 'Jewish American Princess' 
the latter the cause of a brouhaha this year at a midwestern
university), they are more often Roman letters for Yiddish
expressions, as in the aforementioned <em>A.K.</em> or the old <em>T.O.T.</em>
'cash on the line' [<em>Toches Oyfn Tish</em> 'Arse on the Table'] and
<em>T.L. [Toches Leker</em> 'Arse Licker'], which (as recorded in 1970)
has bred <em>T.L.er</em> and <em>T.L.ing</em>.  Other forms of the past twenty
years or so (also recorded in 1970) are the bilingual play on the
pharmacy degree <em>Ph. G.: Papa Hot Gelt</em> 'The father has money'
and on <em>A.M.: Able Mamzer</em> ['bastard'].</p>
<p>What a boost Yiddish has given to commercial enterprise!
It has shown up in the names of various food emporiums:
<em>Eppes Essen</em> 'Something to Eat' delicatessens in Indiana,
Florida, and elsewhere; a <em>Ye Noshery</em> hotel snack bar in Florida
and a <em>Nosh Bar</em> delicatessen in London; <em>Bagel Mavin [meyvn</em>
'connoisseur'] and <em>Bagel Nosh</em> restaurants in New York; the
<em>Mavins New York Scene Restaurant and Deli</em> in San Diego, etc.
It has also spiced up food-product names like <em>Ba Tampte
[batamte</em> 'tasty'] <em>Pickles; Tam Tam</em> [Flavor Flavor] crackers;
<em>Noshies</em>, a Japanese (!) type of snack by Tem Tee; and so on.</p>
<p>Other products capitalizing on Yiddish have ranged from
the <em>Nebbish</em> 'Poor Fool' gift items and the <em>Bupkis [buhpkes,</em>
var. of <em>bopkes</em> 'beans,' 'trifle'] Family of zany dolls, to
imprinted aprons (“Any shnook [<em>shnukel</em> 'sap'; <em>shnuk</em> 'trunk,
snout'] can cook”) and shopping bags (“Schlep!,” “Son of
Schlep,” and “Super-Schlep”), to the Remco game called <em>Shmo</em>
[supposed euphemism for vulgar <em>shmok</em> 'prick,' source of
<em>shmuck</em> and <em>shmucky</em> (increasingly used without awareness of
their vulgarity) and probably of the low-level British forms
<em>shmook, schmock, smock</em>, and (anti-Semitic) <em>shmog</em> and
<em>smoggy</em>].  Not only has there been a board game by Parker
Bros. named <em>Plotz!;</em> but a card game by Originals Only Co. is
named <em>O. Shlemiel</em> ['Lummox']; and a widely selling ladies'
panty-liner from Poirette Corsets, Inc., is dubbed <em>Gotke [gatke</em>
'drawer'].</p>
<p>Bemusing, too, is the variety of entrepreneurs that have
taken advantage of Yiddish in their business titles.  Two seem to
have built on a Sid Caesar joke mentioned earlier: <em>Mitsia
Motors</em>, a Toyota dealer on Long Island, and <em>Takamitziah</em>, a
New York resort hotel with Japanese architecture and a
Samurai lounge (!).  Among many others, there are the <em>Lewis
Imaginative Ippsy-Pippsy Photographers</em> in Los Angeles; <em>Rent-a-Kvetch
[kvetsh</em> 'whiner'], Inc., a New York firm handling
consumer complaints; the <em>Chutzpah [sic]</em> Phone Service in a
number of cities, making challenging calls on assignment; as
well as authors and publishers of such volumes as the <em>Organic
Yenta [yente</em> 'gossip'] <em>Cook Book</em> and the <em>Book of Buffs,
Masters, Mavens [sic] and Uncommon Experts</em>.</p>
<p>As several writers have observed, science fiction seems
particularly hospitable to Yiddish word-play.  Corrupt cops on a
transgalactic planet, for example, are <em>Ganavim [ganeyvim</em>, pl.
of <em>ganef</em> 'crook']; interplanetary visitors to Venus who look like
little brown pillows with tentacles are <em>Bulbas [bulbe</em> 'potato']; a
character named <em>Milchik</em> ['dairy' adjective relating to dietary
laws] has an uncle named <em>Fleischik [fleyshik</em> 'meat,' adj.], etc.</p>
<p>Other fiction, as well as political cartoons, greeting cards,
movies, and stage productions have also utilized Yiddish.  One
adoption that has surfaced in all these and other places is the
deprecating <em>shm-</em> phoneme (discussed by several authors in the
fifties).  It became famous in the old quip, “Cancer, shmancer,
<em>abi gezunt</em> ['as long as you're healthy']” and in the adjective
<em>fancy-shmancy</em>.  Typical are such examples as the classic Herblock
cartoon about the Atomic Energy Commission a generation
ago “Mutations, Shmutations, Long as You're Healthy”;
the dramatic ad of the oil industry in <em>The New York Times</em> Nov.
25, 1979, concerning the windfall-profits tax, headed “Windfall-Schmindfall
[<em>sic</em>],” to the tesselated puzzle recently produced
by Professor Sam Savage of the University of Chicago, wryly
named <em>Shmuzzles</em>.</p>
<p>In direct translation, too, Yiddish has been exploited in the
marketplace and in various media in several versions of “Wear
it in good health” on Misty Harbor raincoat labels; in the
defiant question or exclamation “Who needs it?  (!)” in advertising
of Union Oil Co. and Mutual of New York, among other
companies; in the ironic “That's all I need” in radio commercials
for Bayer aspirin; in the versatile question “Where is it
written that...,” etc.  Significant are the widely adopted
translations that affect besides intonation as seen in the
foregoing syntax and even meaning: “Hurt, it can't”; “What's
with him?”  [<em>What's with</em> for <em>What's the matter with</em>], “What's
to argue?”  [<em>What's to for What is there to...about</em>]; “O.K. by
me” [<em>by</em> for with recorded in 1962]; “I don't want to know
from...” [<em>know from</em> for <em>know or know about</em> recorded in
1970 a usage established by the old translation “He don't
know from nothin',” recorded in 1943]; the ironic “Go know”
and “Go figure” [<em>Go</em> for <em>How could I</em> or <em>Just try to</em> recorded
in 1955]; the shrugging “I should worry” ['Why should I' or
'I'm not about to' first recorded as a Yiddishism in 1914]; the
destiny-invoking “You should be so lucky” a headline in <em>Punch</em>
Dec. 17, 1980 [an expression recorded in 1962, its close
relative, “I should live so long,” having been recorded in 1943],
etc.</p>
<p>Also seen and heard, of course, are jaunty bilingual
adjectives like <em>shmaltzy</em> 'sentimental,' <em>shlumpy</em> 'slovenly,'
<em>klutzy</em> 'awkward,' etc., and inventive bilingual verbs like <em>to
hoo-ha</em> 'to make an issue' [<em>hu-ha</em>, n. 'to-do'; exclam.  'Oh boy!',
'Fancy that!'], and others like the one a White House transcript
credited to President Nixon in 1972: <em>to get schnookered [sic]</em>, an
apparent combination of <em>shnook</em> and the pool term <em>snookered</em>.</p>
<p>Inevitably, malapropisms abound.  Just two “for-instances”:
the confusion of Yiddish intensives in translation,
<em>yet</em> and <em>already</em>, by the <em>Los Angeles Times'</em> travel editor Bruce
Hamby: “...I'm ready to cry, 'Enough, yet!' ” (March 25,
1979); and the mistaking of <em>shmegeggi</em> [<em>shmegege</em> 'jackass'] for
<em>shmear</em> by Jean Bach in a remark to Arlene Francis on New
York's WOR radio Dec. 24, 1979: “When I was a little girl I
had German...kuchen and the whole shmegeggi.”</p>
<p>If we are not witnessing what the maverick psychology
professor A. A. Roback predicted fifty years ago a flooding of
English by Yiddishisms we are certainly seeing a high tide.
Appropriate indeed would be a sail on each of those two
Connecticut boats, <em>L'Chayim</em> and <em>Mahia</em>: i.e., we should live
(and be well) and enjoy!</p>
