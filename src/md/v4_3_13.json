English speakers say <em>dog</em>, French <em>chien</em>,\nand Spanish <em>perro</em>, none of which is related, etymologically,\nto the other, even in the grand scheme of the Indo-European\nfamily of languages, to which all three belong.

This dictionary\nexamines the similarities and the differences; it is a fascinating\npiece of work, usefully arranged.  Most important, it\ntreats in a formalized way a segment of language rarely examined\nvery seriously or systematically, yet, for all that,\nnonetheless revealing.  At bottom, it says “Pooh! Pooh!” to\nthe “Bow! Wow!” theory of language origin.</p>\n<p>Just as surprising, in some ways, that certain sounds that\nwe take for granted as onomatopoeic have very similar counterparts\nin Spanish is the revelation that many others about\nwhich we might have the same feeling, have quite different\nreflexes in Spanish.  The author, a Professor at North Carolina\nState University, marks some entries “Word which is truly\nonomatopoeic” and others “Word with doubtful onomatopoeic\ncharacteristics.” Since he has provided no detailed\nexplanation of his techniques, we are left to wonder how he\narrived at such decisions.  For example, Kloe marks <em>coo</em> (as\nin <em>bill</em> and <em>coo</em>) as “truly onomatopoeic,” which may be difficult\nto find fault with.  However, <em>bill</em> and <em>coo</em> is similarly\nmarked, and, while that may be correct, the image of a bird's\nwandering about uttering “bill and coo” strikes one as strange.\nThe Spanish onomatopoeic counterpart is <em>zurear</em>, yielding\n<em>zurrrr, zurrrr</em> which, if one bears in mind the way Spanish\n<em>r</em> is pronounced, reproduces the sound of a dove more faithfully\nthan <em>coo</em>.</p>\n<p>Some of the close correspondences are interesting: [English/Spanish]\n<em>cock-a-doodle-doo/quiquiriquiar</em> (reminiscent of\nGerman <em>kikeriki</em>, Italian <em>chichirichi</em>, and French <em>coquerico</em>);\n<em>cuckoolcucu; grr-grr/rr-rr; gobble-gobble/gluglu-gluglu</em>; and\n<em>hoopoe, hoopoo/hoopoe</em>.</p>\n<p>This book, as the title promises, doesn't confine itself to\nanimal sounds: under sounds of man we find <em>achool/achu</em>,\n<em>boohoo/buhu</em>, and <em>gargle/gargarizar</em> among an assortment of\nbiological noises that are best left to Alka-Seltzer commercials.\nThere are some items missing: surely, if <em>susurrar</em> is onomatopoeic\nSpanish for <em>rustle</em>, the English equivalents, <em>susurration</em>,\n<em>susurrant, susurrous</em>, and <em>susurrus</em> should be shown.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding other, possible omissions—this review\nwas not conceived as a fault-finding apparatus—the book is\nextremely useful and interesting.  Its organization provides a\ntwo-column format, with each section (animals, man, etc.)\ndivided in two: the first gives English as the source and Spanish\nas the target, the second, vice versa.  There are bilingual glossaries,\na complete index, and what looks like a pretty thin\nbibliography.  The type is large enough for readers with a\nseeing disability; in case the number of pages is off-putting,\nit should be mentioned that the page size is 8-½\"×11\", but\nwhy it is is unclear.</p>\n<p>When will compilers of dictionaries, glossaries, and other\nreference books stop setting headwords for entries all in capital\nletters?  They are hard to read and impossible to spell\n(since one cannot distinguish between words spelled with\nsmall or with capital letters).</p>\n<h1></h1>",
