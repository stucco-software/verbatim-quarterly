By pointing to several words that may be used to translate the meaning of <em>schedule</em> (<em>calendario, planear, agenda</em>) it seems to me that Mr. Bernal is confirming the fact that one cannot find one single word in Spanish to do the work of <em>schedule</em> in English but must search among several words, each of which expresses one aspect of the English word.</p>\n<p>His exegesis on the word <em>wait</em> and <em>hope</em> grants the point I was making by saying that one can clarify the meaning by placing the verb <em>esperar</em> in a phrase that shows its meaning to be 'wait' rather than 'hope.'</p>\n<p>I am sure that Mr. Bernal will agree with me that exercises such as this one are amusing but essentially trivial, and I hope that he has noted in my little essay examples of words in Spanish that cannot be duplicated precisely in English: the treachery of translation works both ways. Shakespeare loses a certain power and beauty when rendered in Spanish, and nobody can really know that towering, comical, tragic <em>caballera de la triste figura</em>, Don Quijote de la Mancha, who cannot read him in Spanish.</p>\n<p>Of course I was using a bit of hyperbole when I suggested that <em>mueran los demócristianos</em> meant 'kill the Christian Democrats,' although one could argue that shouting “Death to Somoza” is not many steps removed from exhorting somebody to kill him. In any event, these cries are quite obviously not to be taken literally.</p>\n<p>\\?\\<em>Salud!</em> Mr. Bernal: I have to say that in Spanish because there is not word for it in English.</p>\n<p><em>[John R.
