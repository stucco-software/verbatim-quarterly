In the context of the book, “Wickedly Funny” must be interpreted as meaning 'cynical, bitter, sarcastic,' though when it comes to people like Phyllis Diller, who is more vulgarly tragic (or tragically vulgar) than funny, it must include self-deprecating comments (“Old age is when the liver spots show through your gloves”; “My plastic surgeon told me my face looked like a bouquet of elbows”). It is misleading to call this a book of quotations: most extracts are comedians' one-liners, and the better comedians—Fred Allen, Goodman Ace, Groucho Marx, and a few others—produce the better one-liners.</p>\n<p>Samuel Goldwyn could scarcely be characterized as a humorist, so his Goldwynisms, rumored to be the product of a publicity agent, at least qualify as quotations. Similarly for Voltaire (not funny), Thomas Fuller (“The patient is not likely to recover who makes the doctor his heir”—clever but not funny), and Bertrand Russell (“There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge”—wise but not funny), and Sigmund Freud (“Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar”—a straight line funny only to us). I should say that the book is entertaining, even amusing; but it is rarely funny: if you enjoy her performances, Rita Rudner is funny on stage saying “The closest I've gotten to a ménage-à-trois was dating a schizophrenic,” but it is not funny to see its concocted cleverness in print.</p>\n<p>The book is organized under six major headings (The Human Animal, Human Endeavor, etc.), with a varying number of subcategories under each (Birth &amp; Childhood, Youth,...Memory,... Sanity &amp; Madness). The quotations are listed in rather haphazard order under these subcategories; authors (including rare attributions to the most popular, Anon.) are ascribed and, if they are dead, their dates are sometimes given (but none for Lenny Bruce, Sigmund Freud, Samuel Goldwyn, Groucho Marx, etc.); it is hard to understand the style. If one is interested only in what Ronnie Shakes or Marty Indik—Who they?—had to say, there is an Index, but it does not list Anonymous.
