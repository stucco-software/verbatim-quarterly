It is not at all helpful to the uninformed, for instance,\nto have to cope with his definition of <em>do your own\nthing:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Used by people who “thing” for themselves.  The full\nmeaning of the phrase is “Do your own thing before\nsomeone else does unto it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No matter how the meaning of the entry can be twisted, it\ndoesn't mean that at all, and anyone trying to understand\nthe meaning could expect no help from this definition.\nAnother entry, <em>drive-in funeral</em>, is, on the face of it, an idea\nin such execrably gross taste that even Lambdin should not\nhave had to tamper with it.  But he did.</p>\n<p>This book achieves neither of two possible goals: it does\nnot provide the reader to whom an expression is unfamiliar\nwith an undistorted definition that he can understand; nor\ndoes it offer humor in its unsubtle presentation of information.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
