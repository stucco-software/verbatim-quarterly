Cassidy}</h1>\n<p>Prof. Bolinger's amusing divagations on <em>darn, durn,\ndamn</em> and their tribe [VERBATIM I, 1, 1-2] leave me somewhat\nagape (and that's not Greek for a love-feast).  If his\n“guesstymology” of <em>darn</em>, etc. derived from <em>down</em> “is a coincidence,”\nsays he, “It is too good to be true.”  By that logic\nthe only true coincidences are bad ones! Could he possibly\nhave meant that it's too good a coincidence <em>not</em> to be true?</p>\n<p>The claimed coincidence is that <em>down</em> was in use as an\nintensifier before <em>darn</em>, etc., that <em>darn</em> is an <em>r</em>-ful repronunciation\nand spelling of <em>down</em>, and that <em>darned</em> (and presumably\n<em>darnation</em>, though he does not mention it) got the\nsuffix by “a kind of secondary synonymy” from association\nwith <em>damned</em> (and presumably <em>damnation</em>).  Thus <em>darn</em> was\nnot in origin a minced form of <em>damn</em> but a pronunciation\nvariant of <em>down</em> which later got into “shady company.”</p>\n<p>What is his evidence?  He depends indirectly on\nWright's <em>English Dialect Dictionary</em>, which dates <em>down</em> as\nan “intensitive” earliest from north Lincolnshire in 1877 in\nthe phrases <em>reäl doon good hand</em> and <em>a doon ohd woman</em>\n('thoroughly old woman'), in which <em>down</em>, clearly adverbial,\nwould translate into Standard English as <em>downright</em>\n(<em>OED</em> sense A2)--better than as <em>damned</em>.  (In other words,\nWright was downright right to list it where he does.)</p>\n<p>Prof. Bolinger might have backed Wright up with\nevidence from Wentworth's <em>American Dialect Dictionary</em>,\nwhere <em>real doon</em> is echoed in an 1893 quotation from Mississippi,\n<em>That is real down nice</em>, “Used by uncultivated\nwhites”; and a closely similar use is to be seen in a 1938\nquotation from southeast Arkansas, <em>That's just hard-down\nmeanness</em>.  Proof that <em>down</em> as an intensive did cross the\nAtlantic and hangs on in dialect use.</p>\n<p>Further backing for Wright might have been found\nin <em>OED down</em>, a., sense 4, labeled <em>Obs</em>., which takes the\nintensive sense (at least as an adjective meaning <em>down-right</em>)\nback to 1617 in Fletcher's rather poetic <em>down-denials</em>.\nThe latest <em>OED</em> quotation, square-bracketed\n(why?), is from <em>Galt</em>, 1830: <em>down nonsense</em>.  This last certainly\ncomes closest to <em>darn nonsense</em> as we say it today,\nthough still quite a distance from <em>damn (ed) nonsense</em>.</p>\n<p>Meantime, <em>OED</em> takes <em>darn, darnation, darned</em> (as\n'perversions of <em>damn, damnation, damned</em>') back to 1837-1840\nin the phrases <em>darned fools</em>, and <em>darn it all</em>, and to\n1844 in <em>I'll be darned</em>, both of which connect syntactically\nfar better with <em>damn</em> and <em>damned</em> than with <em>down</em>.  (No\nevidence in Wright or elsewhere for ?_down it all, ?\\I'll be\ndowned, ?\\a downed fool_.  The missing link.) <em>OED</em> labels\nthese “Chiefly <em>U.S.</em>”--and indeed <em>DAE</em> documents them\nback to 1789 <em>darn</em> adv., 1808 <em>darn</em> v., 1825 <em>darnation</em> n.,\nc1815 <em>darned</em> a., 1806 <em>darned</em> adv.  The 1789 quotation is\nfrom Webster, who takes <em>darn</em> as in <em>darn sweet</em> to be\ndescended from the older word <em>dern</em>, originally meaning\n'secret,' and later 'dark, dismal, dire.'  In a note preceding\nthe quotation, Craigie (or one of his staff) accepts this! It\nhas been a hardy perennial of etymology.</p>\n<p>However, Burchfield's <em>OED Supplement</em> Vol. 1 A-G\nhas now definitively knocked it out, one may hope, with a\nquotation antedating that from Webster: 1781 <em>Pennsylvania\nJrnl</em>.  20 June, “In New England prophane swearing\nis so far from polite as to be criminal, and many use\nsubstitutions such as <em>darn</em> it, for d--n it.”  Bolinger, at least,\nhas wasted no dalliance on this.</p>\n<p>What is the upshot?  Certainly there were two forms,\n<em>down</em> and <em>darn</em>, both with intensive senses, but there the\ncoincidence ends.  <em>Down</em> was English, fell from literary\nuse, developed no other forms, and though brought to\nAmerica had scanty use here.  <em>Darn</em> was chiefly, perhaps in\norigin, American, as were probably <em>darned</em> and <em>darnation</em>\n(see <em>DAE</em>), parallels to <em>damn, damned, damnation</em>.  That\n<em>darn</em> could be from <em>down</em>, while not impossible, is certainly\nimplausible.  <em>Darn</em> had no need of <em>down</em>.  A dying <em>down</em>\ncould have been overrun by a lively, growing <em>darn</em>, but\nthis does not even qualify as an example of reinforcement.\nMeantime there is the positive contemporary statement of\nthe 1781 quotation from the <em>Philadelphia Journal</em>.</p>\n<p>I wish I could claim to have exploded Prof. Bolinger's\n“etymological landmine,” but the bang is too inconsequential.\nStill, darn it, it is mine....</p>\n<p>F.
