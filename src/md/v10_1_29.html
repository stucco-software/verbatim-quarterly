<p>[A VERBATIM Book Club Selection]</p>
<p>For more than a century Latinists have relied on <em>A Latin
Dictionary</em> by Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short, published
by Oxford, as their first and best choice for a comprehensive,
one-volume Latin-English lexicon.  Based ultimately on Freund's
Latin-German dictionary of 1834, subsequently revised and
enlarged in English editions (the last in 1879), the “Lewis and
Short” is a venerable tome but has long since begun to show
signs of its advanced age.  Nevertheless, it has remained the
standard for reading and rudimentary research while the
community of Latin scholars awaited a fit replacement.  Now
the <em>Oxford Latin Dictionary</em>, which has been appearing bit by
bit in fascicles since 1968, is complete and available in a single,
weighty volume.</p>
<p>This is a truly fine and handsome dictionary.  Far more
than merely a modernized replacement for the Lewis and
Short, the <em>OLD</em> is founded on a thorough-going re-evaluation of
the ancient sources, all in the light of the past century's
significant scholarly advances and refinements in textual criticism,
grammar, paleography, epigraphy, and, of course, lexicography.
The principles of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> have
been employed in doing the <em>OLD:</em> articles are laid out in clear
sections and subsections (a vast improvement over the crabbed
appearance of the type in Lewis and Short), with different
senses treated individually, each supplemented by chronologically
arranged citations.  Coverage includes Latin texts dating
from the earliest known through the second century A.D.  The
treatment of individual words is extensive, with major and
minor senses sharply defined and illustrated in context, the
selections drawn from as great a variety of periods as possible.
Some users may be disappointed at the exclusion of Late Latin
words and sources, many of which (especially from Christian
authors) are in Lewis and Short; but the superb treatment of
the period covered, embracing the majority of the great Latin
stylists, more than justifies the editors' decision to set A.D. 200
as the terminus.</p>
<p>A close comparison with Lewis and Short quickly reveals
the significant differences between the books and the superiority
of the <em>OLD</em>.  The <em>OLD</em> contains about 30% more text than
its predecessor (based on character, line, and page counts), not
only a sizable advantage per se, but indicative of the much
deeper coverage everywhere in evidence, all concentrated on a
somewhat narrower span of the history of the language.  As a
result, the <em>OLD</em> is a fair bit bulkier, but still quite manageable
in one volume.  Another major advantage is the very readable
and attractive typography and layout, making the <em>OLD</em> very
pleasant to use, even over a long sitting.  Etymologies are brief
(the editors suggest reference to a standard etymological source
for full treatment) but far more accurate than the woefully
outdated ones to be found in Lewis and Short.  In a justifiable
move for consistency and accuracy, consonantal and vocalic
forms of <em>i</em> and <em>u</em> are not distinguished (Lewis and Short
distinguished <em>i</em> from <em>j</em>, <em>u</em> from <em>v</em>), except for use of V for capital
<em>u</em>, with capitalized entries interfiled (<em>Vaticanus</em> between <em>vatia</em>
and <em>vaticinatio</em>).  The <em>OLD</em> treats only those proper nouns and
adjectives that the editors deemed literarily or historically
significant, a departure from the more encyclopedic approach
of the Lewis and Short but in keeping with much modern
lexicographical practice, which urges the use of other, more
appropriate sources for historical and biographical information.</p>
<p>We might expect this thoroughly modern dictionary to be
less squeamish than its Victorian era counterpart in defining
matters venereal, but such is not always the case.  <em>Mentula</em>, a
vulgar word for 'penis,' is straight forwardly defined, (Lewis
and Short, typically, has 'membrum virile'), but <em>irrumo</em>, another
infamous Catullan word, is defined 'to practice <em>irrumatio</em> on.'
Under <em>irrumatio</em> one reads 'the action of an <em>irrumator</em>.' <em>Irrumator</em>
is given as 'one who submits to <em>fellatio</em>.'  But there is no
entry for <em>fellatio</em>, despite the the editors' use of italics in the
entry for <em>irrumator</em>; indeed this is correct, as the word was not
used in Latin during the period in question.  Strangely, under
<em>fellator</em> is the definition 'one who practices fellatio' (with no
italics).  This is just a small inconsistency, apparently for the
sake of decorum.</p>
<p>In other regards, the <em>OLD</em>, in further contrast to its
ancestor, defines derivative formations as separate headwords,
gives full principal parts for verbs, shows the irregular comparative
and superlative forms for adjectives, and generally has
more and more useful contextual examples for the different
senses of a word.  For the first time in Latin lexicography,
suffixes are treated as headwords, a welcome innovation and
one that balances with the traditional treatment of prefixes as
such.  From many points of view, the <em>OLD</em> reveals itself as a
tool for reading and scholarship that is far more convenient and
reliable than any other Latin-English dictionary.</p>
<p>Some minor criticism: definitions are set in the same
typeface as descriptive information, which can be disconcerting;
synonyms and usage notes have been eliminated; early
bound copies are made up from unsold fascicles, which were
printed at different times and on different stock: when
trimmed, the outside edges have an uneven appearance; page
1918 has an incorrect running head.  Clearly these are minor
points, even taken together, not enough to detract seriously
from the outstanding merit of this dictionary.</p>
<p>Another formidable example of historical lexicography
from Oxford, <em>OLD</em> deserves acceptance as the standard in the
field, which it will probably become in years hence.  It proudly
carries on the legacy of the <em>OED</em>, and at the same time is an
example of that uncanny (British?) knack of creating a reference
book which incorporates the best parts of serious scholarship
while still acknowledging the important considerations of
convenient size and scope, ready accessibility, and sound
synthesis.  While not recommended for the casual or novice
student, the new <em>OLD</em> is indispensable for the serious student
or anyone reading or doing research in the Latin language
beyond the most basic level.</p>
