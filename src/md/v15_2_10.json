Indeed, Bodenheim appends to his book a short\nglossary of Harlem words used in the course of the\nnovel.  I take the liberty of reprinting the glossary here,\nbecause some of the terms are far from common\n(<em>chippy, hootch</em>, and <em>century</em> are perhaps the more\nfamiliar) and many are not included in standard dictionaries\nof slang:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>acecray outcray</em>  —      putting the ace on the bottom of the deck, where the dealer can abstract it<br>\n<em>bah-bah</em>          —      negligible object<br>\n<em>cake-slashing</em>     —     assault and mayhem<br>\n<em>century</em>            —    hundred dollars<br>\n<em>chippy</em>          —       dissolate girl<br>\n<em>chivvy</em>           —      unpleasant odor<br>\n<em>clip your tongue</em>  —     be silent<br>\n<em>cram the paper</em>     —    cheat at cards<br>\n<em>cut your chops</em>      —   mind your own business<br>\n<em>five hard</em>         —     a fist, or a punch<br>\n<em>frill</em>              —    girl, woman<br>\n<em>glued their traps</em>   —   remained silent<br>\n<em>going to the timbers</em> —  retreating<br>\n<em>grand</em>         —         thousands dollars<br>\n<em>grease it</em>      —        pay bribe money, or blackmail<br>\n<em>hamburger down</em>  —       take it easy<br>\n<em>hock your skin</em>   —      make a difficult promise<br>\n<em>hootch</em>            —     liquor<br>\n<em>hotsprat</em>           —    trival but agreeable entertainment<br>\n<em>in the hole</em>         —   out of money<br>\n<em>lame your foot</em>  —       deprive you of assistance<br>\n<em>leathered</em>        —      kicked unfairly<br>\n<em>lippy-chaser</em>      —     a negro who prefers whites<br>\n<em>payman, a</em>          —    a cadet<br>\n<em>pinktail</em>            —   white person<br>\n<em>scrub</em>                —  face<br>\n<em>slide them into the concrete</em> —   eject them to the sidewalk<br>\n<em>spreadeagle</em>    —        to knock down<br>\n<em>stick it</em>        —       capture something<br>\n<em>stick-stick</em>      —      defeated by the previous capture<br>\n<em>stretch</em>           —     jail term<br>\n<em>three-nine</em>         —    sexual variant<br>\n<em>thumb</em>               —   use the thumb to displace cards in a poker-game<br>\n<em>trip his muscle</em>      —  over-reach himself<br>\n<em>wraps, or skins, or strips</em> — dollars</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bodenheim adds a note: “Most of the above-listed\nterms are peculiar to Harlem, but some of them are\nalso used by whites in other sections.”  Only a third of\nthe terms have found their way into <em>The Dictionary of\nAmerican Slang</em>, compiled and edited by Harold\nWentworth and Stuart Berg Flexner (Thomas Y. Crowell, 1967) or Robert Chapman's <em>New Dictionary of\nAmerican Slang</em> (Harper &amp; Row, 1986).  Also Went-worth/Flexner\nand Chapman both cite the term <em>the\nleather</em> as meaning a kick, but they date the term from\n1946, citing a passage from Damon Runyon: “he\nwould give his fallen foe what we called 'the leather,'\nmeaning a few boots abaft the ears...and spareribs.”\nBodenheim's glossary indicates the term was\npopular long before 1946.</p>\n<p>As for <em>hamburger down</em>, meaning to 'take it easy,'\ncould there be any relationship between that term and\nthe hamburger cited by both Chapman and Went-worth/Flexner?\n<em>Hamburger</em> means a 'prize-fighter who\nis badly beaten' or a 'bum'—both persons who are\n“taking it easy.”  Indeed, Bodenheim's list might be a\nsource of enlightenment and delight to curators of\nAmerican slang and is commended to their attention.</p>",
