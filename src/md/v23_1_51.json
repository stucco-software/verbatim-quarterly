They, along with English- and German-speaking children, would appear to have a head start over the French.

Even numbers greater than 100 are sometimes expressed as multiples of twenty-five. This means that 180 CFA francs can be expressed as one hundred plus sixteen fives, or as one hundred plus three twenty-fives plus five, or yet again as seven twenty-fives plus five.</p>\n<p>After this humbling experience I am inclined to review my earlier belief that French children must be at a disadvantage when it comes to mental arithmetic. In fact, children who grow up speaking a language such as French or Mina, which obliges them to make connections between numbers and introduces them to multiples at a very early age, probably take to arithmetic faster than those who plod along adding one to the previous number ad <em>infinitum</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/stx_Verbatim_The_Language_Quarterly_v23n1_Summer_1996\">Internet Archive copy of this issue</a></p>",
