Christmas is the\nonly annual religious holiday to have received official\nand secular sanction by all of the states.  The word <em>holiday</em>\nis another disguised compound, descending from\nthe Old English <em>haligdaeg</em> 'holy day.'  With the change\nin pronunciation has come a change in meaning so\nthat holidays, such as Independence Day and Labor\nDay, are not necessarily holy.</p>\n<p>The name <em>Christ</em> is a translation of the Hebrew\nword <em>messiah</em> 'the anointed one,' rendered through the\nGreek as <em>Khristos.  Jesus</em> also goes back to ancient\nHebrew and the name <em>Yeshua</em> (Joshua), which is\nexplained as 'Jah (or Jahveh, i.e. Jehova) is salvation.'\nWe learn about Jesus through the gospels.  <em>Gospel</em> is\nyet another disguised compound, from the Old English\n<em>god</em> 'good' and <em>spel</em> 'news.'  The four gospels spread\nthe “good news” of the life and work of Christ.  No surprise\nthen that the four men who wrote the gospels are\ncalled <em>evangelists</em>, from the Greek <em>euaggelion</em>, which\nalso means 'good news.'</p>\n<p>The babe was born in <em>Bethlehem</em>, a Hebrew word\nvariously interpreted as meaning 'house of bread or\nfood,' 'house of fighting,' or 'house of (the god)\nLahamut.'  The Christ child was laid in a <em>manger</em>, a\nword related to the French verb <em>manger</em> 'to eat.'  Why?\nBecause Jesus's crib was a large wooden box that had\nserved as a trough for feeding cattle.  We call the worship\nof the new-born Jesus the <em>Adoration</em>, from the\nLatin <em>adoratio: ad</em>- 'to,' <em>oro</em>- 'pray'; hence, 'pray to.'\nAmong those who came to worship were “wise men\n...from the East,” <em>magi</em>, the plural of <em>magus</em>, a\nLatin word for 'magician.'  Magi were members of an\nancient Persian priestly caste of magicians and\nsorcerers.</p>\n<p>In the Christian calendar, the period of preparation\nfor the birth of Christ is called <em>Advent</em>, deriving\nfrom the Latin <em>advenire</em> 'to come toward.'  the word\n<em>yuletide</em>, as a synonym for the Christmas season, dates\nback to a heathen and then Christian period of feasting\nabout the time of the winter solstice (December\n22).  The origin of <em>yule</em> is uncertain.  One suggestion is\nthat <em>yule</em> issues from the Gothic <em>giul</em> or <em>hiul</em>, which\nmeant 'wheel.'  In this context, <em>yule</em> signifies that the\nsun, like a wheel, has completed its annual revolution.\nThe Gothic <em>ol</em> or <em>oel</em> and the Anglo-Saxon <em>geol</em>, all\nmeaning 'feast,' and the Middle English <em>yollen</em> 'to cry\naloud' have also been considered as sources of <em>yule</em>.\nWhence the <em>tide</em> in <em>yuletide?</em>  From an Old English\nword meaning 'time,' as in <em>Eastertide</em> and “Time and\ntide wait for no man.”</p>\n<p>Among the most intriguing Christmas etymologies\nare those for <em>Santa Claus</em> and <em>Kriss Kringle</em>.  When the\nDutch came to the New World, the figure of St. Nicholas,\ntheir patron saint, was on the first ship.  After the\nDutch lost control of New Amsterdam to the English\nin the seventeenth century, Sinterklaas (a form of St.\nNikolaas) gradually became anglicized into <em>Santa\nClaus</em> and acquired some of the features of the English\nFather Christmas.  <em>Kriss Kringle</em> involves an even more\ndrastic change from one language to another.  The\nGermans and German-speaking Swiss who settled in\nPennsylvania in the eighteenth century held the custom\nthat the Christ Child, “the Christkindl,” brought\ngifts for the children on Christmas Eve.  When these\nPennsylvania German (also known as Pennsylvania\nDutch) communities were joined by English-speaking\nsettlers, the Christkindl became Kriss Kringle.  By the\n1840s, Kriss Kringle had irretrievably taken on the\nidentity of St. Nicholas, or Santa Claus.  Slogans like\n“Put Christ back in Christmas” were coined in an\neffort to remind people of the holiday's holy origin.</p>\n<p>Of the various plants associated with the Christmas\nseason, the <em>poinsettia</em> possesses the most intriguing\nhistory etymologically.  A Mexican legend tells of a\npenniless boy who presented to the Christ Child a\nbeautiful plant with scarlet leaves that resembled the\nStar of Bethlehem.  The Mexicans named the plant\n<em>Flor de la Noche Buena</em>, 'Flower of the Holy Night.'\nDr. Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first U.S. minister to\nMexico, discovered the Christmas flower there in 1828\nand brought it to this country, where it was named in\nhis honor in 1836.  The poinsettia has become one of\nthe most popular of Christmas plants—and one of the\nmost misspelled (Pointsettia, pointsetta, and poinsetta\nare all no-nos) words in the English language.  Some\ndictionaries list both poin-set-ee-uh and poin-set-uh as\nacceptable ways to say the name of the plant, but language\nguardians much prefer the first pronunciation.</p>\n<p>Another botanical Christmas item is the pear tree.\nIn the seasonal song “The Twelve Days of Christmas,”\nhave you ever wondered why the true love sends not\nonly a partridge, but an entire pear tree?  That's\nbecause in the early French version of the song the\nsuitor proffered only a partridge, which in French is\nrendered as une pertriz.  A 1718 English version combined\nthe two—“a partridge, une pertriz,” which,\nslightly corrupted, came out sounding like “a partridge\nin a pear tree.”  Through the process known as\nfolk etymology, the partridge has remained proudly\nperched in a pear tree (une pertriz) ever since.</p>\n<p>A Merry Christ Mass and Happy Holy Days to all.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
