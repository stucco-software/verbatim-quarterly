Proverbial expressions have a way of bouncing\nback and forth across territorial boundaries and surely one\nof the most exciting, though frustrating, studies must be the\nsearch for the original version of any given proverb.  Later\nreflections of this French phrase may be seen in Mateo\nAleman's <em>Guzman de Alfarache</em> (Pt. I, 1599) where we find\nthe phrase “<em>le decia que era un estornudo suyo y que tanta\nsimilitud no se hallaba en dos huevos</em>,” (Clasicos Castellanos,\nI, 93).  James Mabbe, the English cleric who translated\n<em>Guzman</em> into English as <em>The Rogue</em> (1622), renders this line\nin his usual verbose fashion as “my mother would tell him,\nthat I was like him, as if I had been spit out of his mouth;\nand that two Egges were not liker one another, than I was\nlike him” (Tudor edition, I, 84), where the Spanish <em>estornudo</em>\n(sneeze) is rendered by <em>spit</em> (both, after all, being forms of\nforceful ejection).  In Italian we also have the phrase, <em>e suo\npadre nato sputato</em>.  M. P.

She then, jocosely I hope, states that “long ago someone\nmust have decided men have minds while women have\nmouths.”  The more charitable and traditional explanation\nassociates the gender with the head piece.  The sign for man\nis much like the gesture of catching hold of the brim of a\nhat (remember those curious items of dress?).  The sign for\nwoman, the thumb tracing a line roughly from the inferior\ntip of the auricle down to the chin, represents the string or\nribbon from the woman's bonnet which was fastened\nbeneath the wearer's chin.
