In North America, “It was established some\nyears ago that there are more dictionaries than television\nsets ...” (Preface, <em>American Heritage Illustrated\nEncyclopedic Dictionary</em>, 1987).</p>\n<p>So you, dear reader, probably own a dictionary.\nBut how big is it?  Let us consider two recent British\ndictionaries.  The <em>Collins COBUILD English Language\nDictionary</em> of 1987 (<em>Cobuild</em>) boasts xxiv plus\n1703 pages.  The <em>Collins English Dictionary</em> of 1986\n(<em>CED</em>) has xxvii plus 1771.  Looking at these figures, or\nat the books themselves, one would assume that the\ntwo dictionaries are of roughly the same size.  And in\none sense they are.  But between <em>water</em> and <em>watt</em> there\nare fifty-four main entries in <em>Cobuild</em> and 148 in <em>CED</em>.\nThey share such entries as <em>water biscuit</em> and <em>waterworks</em>.\nBut in addition <em>CED</em> alone enters <em>water measurer</em>\n(a 'bug'), <em>Watford</em> (a 'town north of London'),\netc.  On the other hand, the shared main entry for\n<em>watershed</em> has twenty-three words in <em>CED</em> but 93 in\n<em>Cobuild</em>.  And the word <em>waterless</em> is a main entry\nin <em>Cobuild</em>, explained in twenty words, whereas in\n<em>CED</em> it is naught but a so-called “undefined runon”—merely\nmentioned, but not explained explicitly,\nas a sub-entry at <em>water</em>.  So <em>CED</em> enters more items\nthan <em>Cobuild</em>, but devotes less space to explaining\nthem.  And that is probably as it should be. <em>CED</em> is\nintended for the adult native speaker of English, whose\nmain concern is with understanding a large number of\nunfamiliar items (including proper names) encountered\nin reading and listening.  <em>Cobuild</em> is intended for\nthe foreign learner of English, whose dual concern is\nwith understanding and using the core vocabulary of\nEnglish, and who, having achieved that aim, can\n“graduate” to a dictionary for native speakers—like\n<em>CED</em>.</p>\n<p>More generally, the size of a dictionary is a function\nof two variables: the number of items entered (its\n“macrostructure”), and the amount of information\ngiven about them (its “microstructure”).  In Charles\nMcGregor's words, a dictionary that says “a lot about a\nlittle” and one that says “a little about a lot” can end\nup roughly the same size.  <em>Cobuild</em> and <em>CED</em> are far\nfrom being such polar opposites, but they exemplify\nthis general point.</p>\n<p>In measuring dictionaries, how far can we rely on\nthe dictionaries' own estimates of their size?  Let us\nconsider the dust-jacket blurbs of <em>Cobuild, CED</em>, and\ntwo other native-speaker dictionaries: the British\n<em>Longman Dictionary of the English Language (Longman</em>,\n1984) and the American <em>Webster's Ninth New\nCollegiate Dictionary</em> (<em>W9</em>, 1983).  Here is what they\n<em>say</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cobuild</em>:   over 70,000 references<br>\n<em>CED</em>:       170,000 references<br>\n<em>Longman</em>:   Over 225,000 definitions and more than 90,000 headwords<br>\n<em>W9</em>:        Almost 160,000 entries and 200,000 definitions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both <em>Longman</em> and <em>W9</em> estimate their macrostructure\n(<em>headwords/entries</em>) and their microstructure (<em>definitions</em>).\nBut what of <em>Cobuild</em> and <em>CED</em>?  What do they\nmean by <em>references</em>?  In <em>CED</em> the relevant definition of\nreference seems to be “a book or passage referred to,” or\nperhaps “a mention or allusion”; in <em>Cobuild</em>, “something\nsuch as a number or name that tells you where\nyou can obtain the information that you want, for example\nfrom a book, list, or map....”  We are none the\nwiser.  It is only from an article <em>about CED</em> that we\nlearn it has “171,000 entries,” which suggests that Collins\nmeans by <em>references</em> what Merriam-Webster means by\n<em>entries</em>.  But <em>CED</em> and <em>Cobuild</em> certainly do not say so!</p>\n<p>And what about <em>Longman's headwords</em>?  Their\nrelevant definition of <em>headword</em> is “a word or term\nplaced at the beginning (e.g. of a chapter or an entry\nin a dictionary).”  Does that mean that the number of\nheadwords equals the number of entries?  And that\ntherefore <em>Longman's</em> macrostructure (number of <em>entries</em>)\nis much smaller than that of <em>W9</em> or <em>CED</em>?  We\nneed to look more closely at the meaning of <em>entry</em>.</p>\n<p>For <em>entry</em> our four dictionaries have this to say in\ntheir relevant definitions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cobuild</em>: a short article about someone or something\nin a dictionary or encyclopedia,...</p>\n<p><em>CED</em>: an item recorded, as in a diary, dictionary,\nor account.</p>\n<p><em>Longman</em>: a dictionary headword [!], often together\nwith its definition.</p>\n<p><em>W9</em>: “4b ... (3): HEADWORD (4): a headword\nwith its definition or identification (5): VOCABULARY\nENTRY”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>W9's</em> relevant definition of <em>headword</em> does not\neven mention dictionaries: “a word or term placed at\nthe beginning (as of a chapter or an entry in an encyclopedia)”.\nBut its definition of <em>vocabulary entry</em> is\nabout dictionaries only:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a word (as the noun <em>book</em>), hyphened or open compound\n(as the verb <em>book-match</em> or the noun <em>book\nreview</em>), word element (as the affix <em>pro-</em>), abbreviation\n(as <em>agt</em>), verbalized symbol (as <em>Na</em>), or term\n(as <em>man in the street</em>) entered alphabetically in a\ndictionary for the purpose of definition or identification\nor expressly included as an inflected form\n(as the noun <em>mice</em> or the verb <em>saw</em>) or as a derived\nform (as the noun <em>godlessness</em> or the adverb <em>globally</em>)\nor related phrase (as <em>one for the book</em>) run on\nat its base word and usu. set in a type (as boldface)\nreadily distinguishable from that of the lightface\nrunning text which defines, explains, or identifies\nthe entry</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we can sort out all the details here—no mean\ntask—it emerges that <em>W9</em>'s <em>vocabulary entries</em> include\nboth what I earlier called <em>main entries</em> (like <em>watershed</em>)\nand what I called <em>subentries</em> (like <em>waterless</em> in\n<em>CED</em>).  But it appears that <em>Longman's headwords</em> are\nonly those that are, or introduce, main entries.  So we\nstill have no way of knowing whether <em>Longman's</em> macrostructure\nis smaller or larger than <em>W9</em>'s!  Nor do our\ntroubles end here.  For in its Explanatory Notes (p.12),\n<em>W9</em> not only calls our attention “to the definition of\n<em>vocabulary entry</em> in this book,” but also introduces us\nto a wholly new notion, that of <em>dictionary entry</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The term <em>dictionary entry</em> includes all vocabulary\nentries as well as all boldface entries in the separate\nsections of the back matter headed\n“Abbreviations and Symbols for Chemical\nElements,” “Foreign Words and Phrases,”\n“Biographical Names,” “Geographical Names,”\nand “Colleges and Universities.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No sooner have we assumed that <em>W9's</em> macrostructure\nof “Almost 160,000 entries” means <em>vocabulary entries</em>,\nthan we must face the possibility that it includes\nsuch other dictionary entries as <em>Harvard U., McGill\nU</em>., and <em>Abilene Christian U</em>.  Have they been counted\nin?  We simply do not know.  But, as a British journalist\nmight say, we should be told.  For <em>W9's</em> exemplary precision\nin telling us what vocabulary entries and dictionary\nentries are is offset by its vagueness about\nwhich type of entry its PR-wallahs have counted for\ntheir blurb.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our gratitude to <em>Longman</em> and <em>W9</em>\nfor saying something about the size of their microstructures\nis offset by our sorrowful recognition of how\nlittle they say.  Counting definitions is a start.  But a\ndefinition can range from a single-word synonym (<em>entry\n4b(3)</em>: HEADWORD) to the 117 words of <em>W9's</em> definition\nof <em>vocabulary entry</em>—and beyond!  And the microstructure\nof dictionaries includes more than just\ndefinitions: it can embrace examples, illustrations,\nsynonym essays, usage essays, etymologies, and all\nsorts of other information.  Everyone talks nowadays\nabout making dictionaries user-friendlier.  How about\nmaking their publicity buyer-friendlier as well?</p>\n<p><em>Aux armes, citoyens</em>!  Let us strive to get dictionary\npublishers to cry their wares in ways that allow us to\ncompare them.  But, <em>citoyens</em>, let us not forget that the\nvalue of a dictionary resideth not in size alone.  The\nbest dictionary for <em>me</em> is the one that gives about the\nword or phrase that puzzles <em>me</em> the information <em>I</em> need\nat the moment <em>I</em> need it.  People have different reference\nneeds at different times.  The standardization of\nthe way dictionaries estimate how much they contain\nneed not, and should not, entail the standardization of\nwhat they contain.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
