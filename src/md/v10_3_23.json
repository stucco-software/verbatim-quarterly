Earlier in this century, and in previous centuries,\nonly the <em>hw</em>- varieties were reported—or “authorized”—in\ndictionaries.  Historically, in Old English (or Anglo-Saxon)\ntimes, i.e., c.450—c.1150, <em>hw</em>- was the prevailing orthography\nfor the beginning of each of the above terms spelt <em>wh</em>- at\npresent.</p>\n<p>One cannot pronounce the sequence <em>wh</em>-.  One either\npronounces <em>hw-</em> or merely <em>w-</em>, or merely <em>h-</em> (as in, e.g., <em>who,\nwhom, whole</em>, or <em>whore</em>).  The result, in our time, of the <em>wh-/w-</em>\ncoalescence, is a new set of homophones including: <em>when/wen,\nwhere/wear, which/witch, why/Y, whale/wail, whet/wet,\nwheel/weal/we'll, whether/weather, whey/way/weigh, while/\nwile, whine/wine, whinny/Winnie, whip/Wip</em>, and <em>whit/wit</em>,\namong others.</p>\n<p><em>Homophones</em> (by definition: 'same sound, different spelling')\nspawn oral-aural ambiguity, but the <em>wh-/w-</em> phonetic\ncoalescence to <em>w-</em> has also harvested doubt among “poor\nspellers” as to how to spell, e.g., <em>whack, whacky, wham, wharf,\nwheat, wheedle, wheeze, whelp, whelm, whence, whim, whimper,\nwhimsy, whirl, whisk(e)y, whisper, whistle, white, whittle</em>,\nand <em>whiz.  [Homonyms</em> are 'forms of different origin with same\nsound <em>and</em> same spelling,' e.g., <em>bear</em> 'endure,' bear 'carry,' <em>bear</em>\n'animal,' etc.; <em>bear/bare</em> are <em>homophones.]</em></p>\n<p>I am among those who admittedly lament the pronunciation\nloss of this initial *h-*sound in our *wh-*words previously\npronounced <em>hw-</em>, though I am aware that this particular elision\nhas been under way for centuries.  For instance, early American\ndiaries reflect confusion among diarists as to “wich whords\nwhould be spelt with <em>w</em>- alone and wich whith <em>wh</em>-.”  (For there\nwere no dictionaries lying about the Colonies to look things up\nin, it should be recalled.)  And the phonetic and orthographic\nhistory of initial- <em>h</em>-sounds in combination, and of corresponding\ninitial-<em>h</em> spellings, reflects the steady disappearance, phonetically\nand orthographically, of <em>h-</em> in English: OE <em>hraf</em> became\nModE <em>roof, hreaw</em> became <em>raw, hræfn</em> became <em>raven, hreod</em>\nbecame <em>reed, hreol</em> became <em>reel, hrer</em> became <em>rare, hring</em>\nbecame <em>ring, hlaf</em> became <em>loaf, hlæder</em> became <em>ladder, hlæn</em>\nbecame <em>lean, hlæfdige/hlafdie</em> became <em>lady, hlid</em> became <em>lid,\nhlot</em> became <em>lot;</em> and, analogously, <em>human</em> (though of Latin\nancestry) is as often “YOOm'n” as it is “HYOOm'n” across the\nEnglish-speaking population, as is English <em>huge</em> both “YOOJ”\nand “HYOOJ.”</p>\n<p>As for the <em>hw-/wh-</em> terms which in Modern English are\npronounced with initial <em>h</em>-, OE <em>hwa</em> and <em>hwam</em> came to be\nspelled with <em>wh-</em> (as <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em>) in unsophisticated\nanalogy with the other <em>hw-/wh-</em> terms.  This particular *h-*sound\nis almost unique with the <em>who</em> family and its offshoots (<em>whose,\nwhoever, whosever, whomever, whosoever, whomsoever</em>, etc.),\nexcept for a few words which were <em>miss</em>pelled with <em>wh-</em> by\nfalse analogy with the <em>who</em> family, as OE <em>hal</em> and <em>hore</em>, which\nbecame, respectively, <em>whole</em> and <em>whore</em>.</p>\n<p>The fixing of this orthographic metathesis from <em>hw-</em> to <em>wh-</em>\ncoincides with the advent of the English printing press [Caxton:\n1476], AT WICH TIME THERE WHERE NO BOOKS TO\nCONSULT... and printers, following their own practices,\nprinted those *w-*terms they were “sure of” with initial <em>w</em>-, and\nthose *hw-*terms they were “sure of” with initial <em>wh-</em> (but which\nfor them were also pronounced as if they were <em>w</em>-terms), thus\ninadvertently mistransposing orthographic <em>hw-</em> for all times to\n<em>wh-</em>.  Even <em>present-day</em> Cockney bears anything but silent\ntestimony to the “instinctive confusion about initial <em>h</em> among\nEnglish speakers,” <em>hwether</em> or not in combination with other\nconsonants.</p>\n<p>The term <em>two</em> (OE <em>twa</em>) bears an analogy with <em>who</em> (OE\n<em>hwa</em>) in eliding the historically functional *w-*sound [more\naccurately, the *-w-*sound].  (All the other *tw-*terms related to\n'two' <em>retained</em> the *-w-*sound: <em>twice, twin, twig, twain, twine,\ntwenty, twelve, twelfth, twill, twist</em>, and <em>betwixt</em> and <em>between</em>.)</p>\n<p>Language <em>change</em> is an inevitable, ever-ongoing process.\nAll the “living language” aspects—pronunciation, meaning,\ngrammar, spelling—are caught up in this flux, most often\nwithout warning, and certainly often “without rhyme or reason.”\nBut once in a while, a prospective change is, in some\nmeasure, predictable.  For instance, with impetus from such\nadvertising contrivances as <em>Redi-Wip</em> and <em>Cheez-Wiz</em> to speed\nus on our way, a century down the road will find our language\nwith <em>wut, were</em> (homophone of <em>wear</em>), <em>wen, wich</em>, and <em>wy.  Who</em>\nwill be the last to go, orthographically ... and nobody alive will\neven <em>remember</em> “whom,” with the exception of a few linguists\nand grammarians and lexicographers...  (It is hard enough to\nimagine a “new” <em>ho</em> (rhyming with <em>to, two</em>, and <em>do</em>), much less\na “new” <em>hom</em> (rhyming with <em>room, tomb</em>, and <em>plume</em>)!  We'll\nsurely settle for <em>hoo</em>.)</p>\n<p>I'm fond of my <em>hwys</em> and <em>hwerefores</em>, already almost\nanachronistic, and my very last gasps will preserve the <em>spiritus\nasper</em> ('rough breathing') of all my aspirating ancestors, as I\nwonder: <em>“Hwat's</em> up?  <em>Hwere</em> to now?  <em>Hwen</em>'ll I get there?\n<em>Hwich</em> way am I going?  and ... <em>Hwy</em> me?!”</p>\n<p>Say <em>Hwen</em>.</p>",
