Its origins are obscure, but we know that it is distantly related to Finnish and belongs to the Finno-Ugric group of languages.</p>\n<p>Part of the fun for the visitor to Hungary is the battle to understand anything at all, whether the words are spoken or written. I remember how delighted I was, on my first visit to Budapest some years ago, when I spotted the word <em>szendvics</em> on the menu of a small restaurant. Yes, it meant 'sandwich' and was at least one word I could recognize. Mind you, it was difficult to find a restaurant in the first place, the word for 'restaurant' being <em>étterem</em> in Hungarian.</p>\n<p>Until recently, the Hungarians accepted foreign words only grudgingly, preferring to create new ones of their own. At one time they even invented a Hungarian word for 'telephone': <em>távbeszélö</em> (literally, 'distance talker'; a calque of German <em>Fernsprecher).</em> But, although this word can be found in the dictionary, it is hardly ever heard. <em>Telefon</em> is the more popular term and the one which, fortunately for the tourist, can be seen on every kiosk.</p>\n<p>Since the fall of the Berlin wall and all that came after, there has been an unstoppable flood of English words pouring into Hungary. It is no surprise to find that the new language of computers has been fully integrated into Hungarian: words like <em>hardver</em> and <em>softver</em> are commonplace. But over the last few years a stream of everyday English words has stormed through the language barrier. This is not only because the country is now bombarded with English language TV programs on various European channels, but also because western pop culture has taken such a strong hold among the young.</p>\n<p>A random selection of English loanwords—with no Hungarian translation given—taken from recent newspapers, magazines, and conversations, includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>mani</em> 'money'; <em>kes</em> 'cash'; <em>menedzser</em> 'manager'; <em>deler</em> 'dealer'; <em>biznisz</em> 'business'; <em>marketing; lizing</em> 'leasing'; <em>frencsajz</em> 'franchise'; <em>holding; diszkont</em> 'discount'</p>\n<p><em>bébi szitter; drink; heppening; hostess; New Age</em>; <em>jogging; dizajn</em> 'design'; <em>toples; jackpot; horror;</em> tinedzer 'teenager'; <em>fitness club</em></p>\n<p>And on Budapest shop fronts you can now see strange “<em>szlogans</em>” displayed in English: <em>Non-Stop</em> 'open 24 hours'; and the mysterious <em>Goods Made in World</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how many of these words, reflecting current preoccupations in Hungary, will be accepted permanently. I think most of them will, and I, for one, regret this. Something of the uniqueness of the Hungarian language will be lost for ever. Besides, what challenge will there be for the enterprising tourist?</p>\n<h1></h1>",
