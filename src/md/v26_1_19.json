Friendly, accessible, and scholarly (Allan Metcalf is the executive secretary of the American Dialect Society; more information about the society is available at <a href=\"http://www.americandialect.org\">www.americandialect.org</a>), <em>How We Talk</em> is a wonderful overview of American English in all its variety.

The language of a place has as much charm as the food and the scenery (and is much harder to make overcommercialized and watered down for the tourist trade). This guidebook for the linguistic traveler might spark some trip planning just to hear these accents and words. (I can see the tour groups now—instead of whale watching, see someone who calls green peppers <em>mangoes,</em> or who uses <em>one</em> for <em>a:</em> “I get one headache!”)</p>\n<p><em>How We Talk</em> also includes a section on dialect in the movies, pointing out good (and not so good) cinematic examples of regional American English.</p>\n<p><em>How We Talk</em> is a book that is sure to become a favorite. (You might as well get two copies; one to keep and one to lend.)</p>\n<p>—<em>Erin McKean</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
