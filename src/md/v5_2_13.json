And sunny weather will be a <em>plus</em> for the next outdoor\ntournament.</p>\n<p>What riles me, however, is the increasing number of\npeople who mistakenly think that <em>plus</em> is also a conjunctive\nadverb.  From a U.S. Senator I received a fund-raising letter\nwith this sentence: “Plus they tell us we should increase the\ndefence budget.”  And the director of one of our most eminent\nuniversity presses offered me “a 20 per cent discount—plus\nwe will pay all postage and handling costs.”</p>\n<p>Almost daily on radio and television I hear this usage coming\nfrom program hosts, reporters, and anchormen.  Boston's\nhighest-rated news channel tells me: “Those are tonight's\nheadlines, plus we'll have a report on....”  One commentator\neven declared, “I'd vote her an Academy Award.  Plus she's\nalso....”  Note not only the <em>plus</em> but also the tautological\n<em>also</em>.</p>\n<p>William and Mary Morris, in their <em>Harper Dictionary of\nContemporary Usage</em>, felt it necessary to call attention (p.\n476) to this solecism: “<em>Plus</em> cannot be used as a substitute for\n<em>also</em> as the first word of a sentence when the intent is to link\nthe sentence with the one which precedes it.”  And they rightly\nproclaimed this use “illiterate.”  Yet the bombardment\nfrom linguistic barbarians continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Let me make clear that I have no objection to new words\nor to new uses of old words when they fill a real need in our\nlanguage.  But there is no excuse for misusing <em>plus</em> to duplicate\nwhat can properly be expressed by <em>also, too, moreover, besides,\nfurthermore, as well, to boot</em>, and <em>in addition</em>—not to\nmention <em>and</em>.</p>\n<p>So surfeited am I that I can't bring myself to peek inside\nJoseph McElroy's recently published novel entitled, simply,\n<em>Plus</em>.  The word has become a p(l)ustule.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
