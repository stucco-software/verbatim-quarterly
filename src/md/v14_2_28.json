It is doubtful that all\ncould be covered, and it is sad that a combination of\nthe authors' efforts and the publisher's support could\nnot have produced a more comprehensive work.  My\nsecond complaint—though one that is more readily\nanswerable—is that the bibliographical sources for this\nbook are listed in another book, <em>Lexicographic\nDescription of English</em>.  That book is not at hand while\nI write this review; in fact, I am not certain that I\nhave it, and I think it unforgivable (I blame the publisher)\nthat a reader/user be referred to a different\nwork; I find the present work greatly diminished by\nthe shortcoming.</p>\n<p>For those who have not needed to distinguish between\nidioms and collocutions, an explanation is in order.\nIt is generally accepted that an idiom is a collection\nof two or more words the meaning of which is different\nfrom the sum of the literal meanings of the individual\nelements.  Thus, while <em>red herring</em> may be, literally, a\nherring that is red, it is more likely to mean 'false trail'\nor, in financial circles particularly, an 'offer of new\nshares in a corporation.'  Similarly, <em>kick the bucket, fly\noff the handle, take in</em> 'deceive,' <em>comic book, green\nthumb</em>, etc.  A detailed discussion of this complicated\ngenre must be left to another time.  At the other extreme\nare the ordinary formations that reflect completely independent\ngrammatical and lexical uses of the language.\nThus, <em>on the house</em> in <em>The roof is on the house</em> is\nsuch a usage, while in <em>The drink is on the house, on the\nhouse</em> means 'free of charge.'  Somewhere in the middle,\nbetween these extremes, are <em>collocutions</em>, that is, the\nordinary combinations that habitually recur in a language.\nThese may be more or less metaphoric (which\ncreates a genuine problem of selection) and, like idioms,\nfall into the general category of clichés.  The <em>BBI</em> (for\nBenson, Benson, Ilson) <em>Dictionary</em> concerns itself with\nsuch collocutions, their listing, and their classification\ninto several grammatical and lexical classes of some\nrefinement.  I get the impression because of the very\ndifficult work of classification that a number of common\ncollocutions have slipped through the net and that\nsome of those included have missed their proper categorization.\nBefore detailing these items, it would be just\nto point out that when a native speaker deals with his\nown language, the semantic elements being analyzed\nfrequently become like optical illusions: they appear\none way on a Friday afternoon and in a completely\ndifferent guise on Monday morning.  Here are some observations\nand queries:</p>\n<p>1)  Why is <em>run over</em> in, showing <em>She ran over to\nher friend's place</em>?  In my analysis, <em>run</em> in this context is\nrarely literal, any more than it is in <em>I'll run out</em> (or\n<em>down) and buy some more beer</em>.  If <em>run up to</em> is exemplified\nby <em>She ran up to me</em>, then perhaps a better\nexample for <em>run over</em> would be <em>She ran over to where I\nwas standing</em>.  (Note that <em>run over</em> in the senses of\n'overflow' and 'hit with a car or other vehicle' are not\nin, nor should they be, for they are idiomatic, not\ncollocutional.)</p>\n<p>2) <em>Check in</em> seems to be missing, though it is the\nintransitive form for <em>check into</em>: one says <em>I checked\ninto (or in at) the hotel this morning</em> (but not *<em>I\nchecked into this morning</em>) and <em>I checked in this morning</em>\n(but not *<em>I checked in the hotel this morning</em>).</p>\n<p>3)  For American English (AE), <em>check off</em> (British\nEnglish: <em>tick off</em>) ought to be in: <em>They checked our\nnames off; Please check off the books you want</em>.  And\nwhat about <em>check in</em> 'report,' as in <em>I'm just checking\nin?</em></p>\n<p>4)  Where is <em>rubber check?</em>  The modern colloquialism\n<em>cut a check?</em></p>\n<p>5)  Why is <em>to count one's chickens before they are\nhatched in?</em></p>\n<p>6)  Some of the definitions could be made more\nprecise.  For example, <em>it works like a charm</em> is defined\nas 'it works perfectly,' while a more felicitous gloss\nmight be 'it works like magic.'  At <em>chemistry</em>, 'empathy'\nmight be better than 'personal feelings.'  What is the\ndifference between <em>charge</em> 4 ... <em>they charged ten dollars\nfor shipping (our books</em>) and 12... <em>she charged\nfifty dollars for her services?</em></p>\n<p>Generally, the treatment of nouns is better than\nthat of verbs.  If one looks up <em>chin</em>, for instance, the\nwords <em>double</em>, <em>smooth</em>, and <em>glass</em> are shown as frequently\nassociated with it, but not <em>chin music</em> or <em>up\nto the chin in</em>—.  <em>Nose</em> is missing <em>retroussé</em>, but <em>cauliflower\near</em> is in.  Other common combinations are not\ncovered, e.g., <em>battered child</em> (but <em>battered wife</em> is in),\n<em>child labor, to get with child, buffalo chips, to let\nthe chips fall where they may, chip shot (golf), Father\nChristmas, Christmas present, Christmas sale,\nChristmas tree</em>, etc.  These are probably not oversights\nbut deliberate omissions made in order to have\nthe space to accommodate entries deemed more important,\nand more's the pity that the book is not\nseveral times its length and comprehensiveness.  A\nscanning of <em>Idioms</em> and <em>Phrases Index</em>, Gale Research\nCompany, 1983, would have yielded a number of entries,\nand recourse to private collections (I have some\n50,000) would have been fruitful, too.  It is worth\nmentioning that a work by Albrecht Reum, <em>A Dictionary\nof English Style</em>, Leverkusen, 1955, attempted\na similar analysis, though employing a different\nstructure.  It is entirely possible that <em>BBI</em> had\naccess to these sources, but without a self-contained\nbibliography, it is hard to tell.  [A subsequent check\nrevealed the Reum book in the Bibliography of <em>Lexicographic\nDescription of English</em>.—Ed.]</p>\n<p>As it stands, the book reflects contemporary English.\nOne of its useful features is the system of usage\nnotes appearing here and there, for example: “The\nverb <em>grow</em> 'to become' often suggests a gradual process\nrather than a sudden change.  Compare <em>to grow cold</em>\n(gradually) and <em>to turn cold</em> (suddenly)”;  “The sentence\n<em>she needn't have gone</em> implies that she did go\n(though there was no need for her to go).  The sentence\n<em>she didn't need to go</em> does not indicate if she went or\nnot.”</p>\n<p>The structure of the entry is a little confusing at\ntimes, but any user, especially the learner of English as\na foreign language, will find valuable information\nhere once he breaks the code.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
