Any hollow disappointing specious thing.”</p>\n<p>The <em>OED</em> editors then quote from <em>The English Mechanic</em> <em>and</em> <em>World of Science,</em> published from 1865 to 1923 in London by E. J. Kibblewhite: “1869 <em>Eng. Mech.</em> 24 Dec. 354/1 Mecca galls, Dead Sea Apples, Sodom Apples, or mad apples . . . are occasionally imported from Bussarah.”</p>\n<p>The connection with Josephus is based upon a passage about the city of Sodom found in his <em>Jewish War.</em> Describing the fruits grown in the now blasted and cursed land, he states that “one can see cinders reproduced in the fruits, which from their outward appearance seem edible, but after being plucked by hand disintegrate into smoke and ashes.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b1\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>A striking, but heretofore unnoticed, occurrence of the phrase is found in Charles Francis Adams, Jr.'s assessment of his service with the Union forces during the Civil War. Upon his enlistment in 1861 his mood was one of jubilation. Charles Jr. declared in a letter to his father Charles Sr. in 1862: “I would not have missed it [his first experience under fire] for anything . . . the sensation was glorious, . . . Without affectation it was one of the most enjoyable days I ever passed.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">2</a></sup> By 1864, however, his views had changed. In a letter to Henry Adams dated July 22, he wrote: “My present ambition is to see the war over . . . I am tired of the Carnival of Death.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1916, the year his <em>Autobiography</em> was published, he closed the chapter entitled, “War and Army Life,” with this summation: “As it was in June, I think, I was quietly mustered out of the service, and became once more a civilian. A great experience was over, and its close was for me a Dead Sea apple. But I intended it well!”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b4\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>How the term came into Adams' vocabulary is not clear. In his undergraduate years at Harvard he had in his own estimation “rather a fancy for Greek”. . . and . . . “came within an ace of being a fair Greek scholar.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b5\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">5</a></sup> He might well have read Josephus' original text in Greek, however the noun Josephus used meant fruit in general, not apple specifically. But regardless of Adams' source, his words and their reference to the Old Testament city of Sodom provide us with a vivid summation of his feelings about the Civil War—one that would be instantly understood by his fellow Americans, north and south alike. For that was an era whose aesthetic was deeply influenced by the Bible. His is also the first example of the phrase in American letters.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>[Michele Ronnick is an associate professor in the Department of Classics, Greek, and Latin.]</em></p>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b1\">\n<p>For the Greek text, see Josephus, <em>Jewish War,</em> ed. and trans. by H.
