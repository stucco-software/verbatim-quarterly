Gummere, (privately published 1989, Words &amp; c/Box 411/ Haverford, PA 19041), xiii + 128pp.</p>\n<p>Born 1901, John Flagg Gummere received a\nPh.D. in Indo-European languages from the University\nof Pennsylvania in 1933; he died around 1988\n—the date is not given in the brief biography provided\nby John Francis Marion, an old friend.  Gummere\nwas headmaster of Penn Charter School for\ntwenty-seven years, later taught classics and humanities\nat Haverford College.  We were—how to put\nit?—distantly in touch with each other: though we\nhad never met, we knew some of the same people\nand knew of each other.  We corresponded occasionally\n(in connection with VERBATIM, which he read\nand, I think, enjoyed), and his warmth came through\nin his letters.  This book is an attractive and friendly\ncollection of his short pieces on language, written\nwith the authority of Gummere's scholarship and utterly\nlacking in pedanticism.  I do not know how\nmany copies were printed or how much they cost,\nbut I urge you to inquire and get two copies if you\ncan, one to keep and one to give to someone else\nwho loves language.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
