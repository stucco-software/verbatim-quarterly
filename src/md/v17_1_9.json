It is regrettable\nthat these fine pieces are marred by the intrusion\nof an inferior “Anglish-Yinglish Dictionary.”</p>\n<p>In the brief Preface, Bluestein defines <em>Anglish</em> as\n“Anglicized Yiddish... which turns Yiddish words\ninto colloquial English (as in <em>shmo</em>),” and <em>Yinglish</em> as\n“Yiddishized English, ... which gives English\nwords and expressions the qualities of Yiddish syntax\nand intonation (as in 'a <em>Heifetz</em> he isn't').”  Even if\none were to accept this peculiar nomenclature, the\ndistinction it is supposed to draw is hardly significant,\nsince these types of formations are only two of\nthe many characteristics of Jewish English (the collective\nterms for all the varieties of English used by\nJews).  The very terms <em>Anglish</em> and <em>Yinglish</em> invite\nscholarly derision as being both facetious and inaccurate.\nTo worsen things, the author is not even consistent\nwithin the framework of this distinction.  Most\nof the entries in the “dictionary” are not labeled\neither Yinglish or Anglish, and for good reason, as\nthey do not fit into either category.  For example,\n<em>adeSHEM</em>, defined as “a Hebrew euphemism for the\nTetragrammaton”; <em>kakuh-MAYmee</em>, about which the\nauthor says “not Yiddish but it sounds like it,” misspelling\nthe actual English word as <em>cockamaimy</em>.</p>\n<p>The entries are a mishmash run riot.  They include\nformal Jewish-interest terms <em>(Ladino, YHVH)</em>,\nirrelevant non-Jewish names (<em>Prufrock</em>—yes, T.S.\nEliot's—an entry that runs on for two and a half\npages), the name of just one Yiddish theatrical figure,\nBoris <em>Tomashefsky</em>, Hebrew literary works (<em>Zohar</em>),\nnonce formations (<em>money/shmoney</em>, which\ntakes up two pages), misspelled place names to indicate\nmispronunciation (<em>BRANzvil</em>, for <em>Brownsville</em>, a\nsection of Brooklyn), Yiddish words that are never\nused in English (<em>FUHLKStimlech</em> 'folksy,' <em>guht</em> 'God,'\n<em>ich starb</em> 'I'm dying'), encyclopedic terms (<em>black\nJews</em>), and nonexistent words (<em>who-er</em> “defined” by\nthe author as “Not exactly Yiddish, but the New\nYorkish pronunciation of whore”).</p>\n<p>The equally whimsical nature of the “definitions”\ndefies description.  A nonce word, <em>aKOOSHerke</em>, is defined\nas “Friddish for midwife,” from which one is to\ngather that “Friddish” (which is nowhere explained)\nstands for a French-Yiddish mixture.  Under <em>bris</em> 'circumcision'\nsixteen lines are quoted from Genesis 17\nwhere a simple reference would have sufficed.  The\nYiddish word <em>KETSele</em> (not used in English), meaning\n'pussycat,' is cryptically “explained” as a “term of endearment\nand the source of all the current pussycat\ntitles with their sexy connotations.”  Go figure.</p>\n<p>The pronunciations are indicated in a confusing\nand inconsistent “newspaper-style” key.  For example,\nthe symbol “uh” is shown in the key as representing\nschwa, yet throughout the book it is used to\nrepresent the vowel sound in English <em>ball</em> or <em>raw\n(BUHbe</em> 'grandmother,' <em>puhGRUHM</em> 'pogrom').  An\nEnglish word like <em>allrightnik</em> is rendered as <em>allRAITnik</em>\nto make it seem Yiddish.  And so on.</p>\n<p>The “dictionary” has one saving grace: many of\nthe entries are illustrated by citations from the\nworks of writers like Saul Bellow, Joseph Heller, Allen\nGinsberg, Bernard Malamud, Chaim Potok,\nPhilip Roth, and Isaac Bashevis Singer.  It is a pity\nthat the author (and his publishers) had not enough\ngood sense to submit a draft of the “dictionary” to\none or several Yiddish scholars for scrutiny and criticism.\nA fine collection of citations using Yiddish-origin\nwords is buried under a rubble of dross.</p>\n<p><em>Sol Steinmetz</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
