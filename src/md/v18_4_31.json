Is this some sort of insider's put-down?\nAs there was no accompanying article, Messrs.\nMitchell and Field were not further identified, so we\ncan assume that they are “the” Mr. Austin Mitchell\nand “the” Mr. Frank Field, who, of course, are\nknown to all at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference\nCentre as key people involved in Challenge, or as\nboulevardiers famous for sporting British-made\nclothing and shoes.  But pretty Rachael Garley (not\n“Miss,” “Ms.,” or “Mrs.,” mind you), whose name\ndoes not ring the bells in my head that are (w)rung\nby names like Marilyn Monroe, Margaret Thatcher,\nand Marie, Queen of Rumania, is identified as “the”\nmodel, as if she were being distinguished from the\nRachael Garley who succeeded Sir Randolph Quirk\nas president of the British Academy and that other\nRachael Garley whom we all know to be <em>the</em> (not\n“a”) power behind Boris Yeltsin or Saddam Husein.\nOr perhaps she is identified as “the” model just to\nremind us that she is an outstandingly unique and\nfamous model, to be distinguished from what might\notherwise be characterized as “a” model, which\nwould make her just another one of the pack.  In\nsuch cases, “the” is followed by a real or implied\n“well-known” or some equivalent thereof, to wit,\n(<em>internationally) famous, beloved, notorious, undisputed,\ndisputed, recently released</em> (or <em>Escaped</em>), <em>prize-winning,\nnovelist,</em> etc.  Note the difference between\nthe transposed form,...<em>with the model, Rachael\nGarley, and Mr</em>...., and the form as given:...<em>with\nRachael Garley, the model, and Mr.</em>... Clearly, the\nfirst seems to call for “a model,” for the name, surrounded\nby punctuation becomes less significant;\nalso, in that sequence the reader is not boxed into\nthe corner of obligation where he must stand, face to\nthe wall, if unaware of who this “in” personage\nmight be.  If a young person today were to encounter\na reference to, say, “the madam, Polly Adler,”\nthe question might well come up, “Who was or is\nPolly Adler?”  in which case the reply would probably\ngo something like, “She was A well-known\nbrothel-keeper of the 1920s and '30s in New York.”\nThat is, the “the” would naturally and abruptly\nchange to an “a,” (particularly in reference to New\nYork, where it is acknowledged that brothel-keeping\nwas endemic and madams' fame universal).  Had the\nreply been, “She was THE well-known brothelkeeper...,”\nthat could have been interpreted as a\nput-down of the questioner, as if to say, “You stupid\nignoramus!  Everyone (else) in the world knows that\nshe was the Brothel-Keeper Extraordinaire of New\nYork!”</p>\n<p>This approach is often used by “entertainers”\nwho invoke strange names of strange people to demonstrate\nto an audience that they are au fait with the\nlatest, though I am never quite sure “the latest\nwhat.”  It is also the technique of the “in” joke\nshared between such entertainers and their audiences,\nthough how “in” something can be when\nshared with thousands is debatable.  I felt definitely\n“out” when I first heard a British audience applaud\nwith chuckling appreciation at the mention of the\nname <em>Val Doonican</em>.  For all I knew, the man who\nsaid it had made up the name and the audience was\nlaughing because the name was funny, as they might\nwell do when hearing a name like <em>Kylie Minogue</em>.  It\ntook me a while to understand that <em>Kylie Minogue</em> is\nthe name of a real person.  I also discovered that <em>Val\nDoonican</em> is the name of a real person.  Though I\nhave no way of knowing whether either name is genunine\nor assumed, it occurs to me that if one wanted\nto assume a name, more euphonious choices might\npresent themselves.  On the other hand, <em>Kylie Minogue</em>\ndoes have a certain <em>je ne sais pas</em> about it (as I\nonce heard someone say).  Certainly, it seems unlikely\nthat someone would have to refer to her as\n“Kylie Minogue, the singer,” except for the benefit\nof the same people who need the reinforcement afforded\nby “Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister,”\n“George Bush, the president,” or “Elizabeth II, the\nqueen,” as if to distinguish them from the local\nroofer, the itinerant hedge-trimmer, or the ocean\nliner.  There are not a lot of prime ministers, presidents,\nand queens about—at least, not that we are\nexposed to continually in the media—and it would\nbe a bit ludicrous to read about “Margaret Thatcher,\na prime minister,” etc.  On the other hand, till she\nbecomes as famous as Thatcher or Elizabeth II, it\nseems to me that Rachael Garley ought to be referred\nto as “a,” not “the model.”  To be sure, there\nare not a lot of Rachael Garleys, Val Doonicans, or\nKylie Minogues about, either, for which we and they\nmay be equally thankful.</p>",
