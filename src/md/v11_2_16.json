However, he did not follow\nthose examples when writing in the English language.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of better understanding of English by the use\nof simple words, why did Mr. Cohen write, “Numerous\nmedical terms are equally <em>unesoteric</em> in Dutch,” when he might\nhave written, “equally clear in Dutch”?  Again, Mr. Cohen\nwrote, “A high frequency of <em>vocables</em> of Romance root is\ntherefore unsurprising.”  Wouldn't it have been more easily\nunderstood had he said, “A high frequency of <em>words</em> derived\nfrom Latin roots is therefore not surprising”?  Another excerpt:\n“Whereas a considerable proportion of English scientific terminology\nis <em>compounded</em> from <em>recondite</em> elements (usually of\nLatin or Greek origin) and hence <em>abstruse</em>.”</p>\n<p>Why didn't he say, <em>made up from</em>, rather than <em>compounded\nfrom</em>?  And why the redundant use of <em>recondite</em> and\n<em>abstruse</em> when both words have essentially the same meaning,\ni.e., 'concealed or hidden'?  Then he uses the word <em>components</em>,\nrather than the simple word, <em>parts</em>.  And why use the word\n<em>memorization</em> rather than <em>remembering</em>?  Then we find <em>mnemonic\naid</em>, which is somewhat of a redundancy inasmuch as\nthe word <em>mnemonic</em> alone is defined as “assisting, or aiding\nmemory.' It is doubtful that many 'laymen' use, or understand,\nthe word, and why should they?</p>\n<p><em>Analogous</em> is another example.  Why not simply use <em>similar</em>\nor <em>alike</em>?</p>\n<p><em>Unambiguous</em> could be expressed by simple words such as\n<em>clear, definite</em>, or <em>certain</em>.</p>\n<p>Excerpt: “Dutch scientists seem to be more often in a\nposition to use such a demotic term than their English-speaking\ncolleagues.”  Wouldn't it have been clearer to the layman if the\nword <em>popular</em> had been used rather than <em>demotic</em>?</p>\n<p><em>Calques:</em> a word ten laymen out of ten—and probably nine\nout of ten students of English—have never even heard of!\nCouldn't Mr. Cohen have used the simple word, <em>copies</em>, rather\nthan <em>calques</em>?</p>\n<p><em>Agglutinations</em> is another.  The layman would have more\nclearly understood had it been stated that two or more words\nhad been <em>united</em> or <em>glued together</em> to form one word, such as\n<em>beefsteak, grapevine</em>, or <em>inasmuch</em>.</p>\n<p>One wonders if Mr. Cohen was more intent on displaying\nhis knowledge of the Dutch language, and his own undoubted\nerudition, than to writing in language that “any layman can\nunderstand.”</p>\n<p><em>[Arthur G.
