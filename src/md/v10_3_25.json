The set includes a plastic\nbag (opaque), 4 racks, and 96 letter prisms.  What is a letter\nprism, you ask?  A letter prism is a tentlike plastic prism, closed\nat the ends, open on one side, and bearing letters and scoring\npoints on the other two sides.  When a letter prism is placed on\nthe board, one side faces upwards.</p>\n<p>The play is similar to that of <em>Scrabble</em>: each player takes\nseven prisms and arrays them on his rack.  At once, the player\nsees that one of the two letter-bearing sides has a dark brown\nletter on a light-beige field, the other a light-beige letter on a\ndark brown field.  (Does one dare to suppose that the “official”\ncolors of VERBATIM have been used?)  Thus, with the prisms\narrayed before him, the player can see both letters on each\nprism, giving him a choice of 14, rather than seven, letters\nfrom which to form words.  Although the play is essentially the\nsame as for <em>Scrabble</em>, the scoring is different: words of all beige\nor all brown letters are scored double the sum of the letter\nvalues, provided the word is of five or more letters.  Also, the\nplayer has the option (get it?) to pivot a letter in a word\nalready made (if a legitimate word is so formed) and to use it\nin a new word.  For instance, if SEX is horizontal on the board,\nand the next player wants to form THERE vertically, he can flip\nthe s tile to reveal the H, forming THERE using the H of HEX,\nand collecting points for both words.</p>\n<p>I played three games with friends, who prefer to remain\nunidentified because I won, 448 to 220, 381 to 303 and 311 to 1.    Scoring should not be compared to that of <em>Scrabble</em>,\nbecause the method is different: placement of prisms on the\nboard is irrelevant; the heavy scoring comes from using all\nseven prisms and from making words all in the same color.  In\nother words, <em>Option</em> is a simple game to learn to play, which\ncan be said about all good games.  It also offers much more than\ndouble the number of opportunities for making words (though,\nbecause of the distribution of letters on the prisms, it is not a\nfactorial function).  It takes a little getting used to to have 14\nanagrammatic options open to you (plus what may be on the\nboard), and the game is somewhat slower because of the\nadditional possibilities.  It is, in some ways, more challenging\nthan <em>Scrabble</em> because of the added opportunities afforded both\nby having 14 letters and by being able to flip prisms on the\nboard.  As I have played only three times, I cannot say how\naddictive <em>Option</em> might become, but I think it has great\npossibilities.  My opponents and I enjoyed playing the game\nimmensely, though I enjoyed winning more than they enjoyed\nlosing.</p>\n<p>I do have a couple of criticisms, however: first, the prisms,\nwhich are made of hollow plastic, are too light and are difficult\nto handle; second, the rack is a bit awkward.  Similar to the\n<em>Scrabble</em> rack, the <em>Option</em> rack is tilted a little more to the\nvertical so that the player views the prisms edge-on, allowing\nhim to see both letters.  But it, too, is light and tended to skitter\nabout on the smooth surface where we were playing.  One\nmight assume that, given sufficient encouragement from sales,\nParker Brothers will soon offer <em>Option</em> sets with wooden prisms\nand racks—perhaps diamond-studded if business really booms.\nAnd there is no reason why it shouldn't.  Buy it—or should I say\n“Take the Option!”—you will probably like it and may even\nswitch your allegiance from <em>Scrabble</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Scrabble</em> boards list all of the tiles and their quantities.\n<em>Option</em> doesn't, so, in the interests of usefulness, here is the\nbreakdown (with scoring points):</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>QTY</th>\n<th>BROWN LETTER</th>\n<th>SCORE</th>\n<th>BEIGE LETTER ON OTHER SIDE</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>E, E, I, I, O, O, R, U</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>B</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>D, F, P</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>E, M, N, W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>G, M, N, S, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>E</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>A, A, H, I, I, L, N, O, S, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>F</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>K, P</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>G</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>E, N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>H</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>E, L, N, R, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>A, E, E, L, N, O, O, R</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>J</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>K</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>L</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>R, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>M</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>T, W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>E, S, S, T, Y</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>O</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>A, A, E, I, L, T, U</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>P</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>V</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Q</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>(wild)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>R</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>D, E, H, L, N, O, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>E, G, H, M, N, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>T</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>A, C, E, H, I, L, N, O, S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>U</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>A, E, O</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>V</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>W</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>(wild)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Y</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>E</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Z</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>* (wild)</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>J, Z</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>and, going the other way</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>QTY</th>\n<th>BEIGE LETTER</th>\n<th>SCORE</th>\n<th>BROWN LETTER ON OTHER SIDE</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>E, E, I, O, O, T, U</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>B</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>B, R</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>E</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>A, A, C, G, H, I, I, N, O, R, S, T, U, Y</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>F</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>G</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>D, S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>H</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>E, R, S, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>A, A, E, E, O, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>J</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>(wild)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>K</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>F</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>L</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>E, H, I, O, R, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>M</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>C, D, S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>D, C, E, G, H, I, R, S, T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>O</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>A, A, E, I, I, R, T, U</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>P</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>B, F</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Q</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>R</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>A, H, I, L</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>D, E, N, N, T, W</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>T</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>D, E, H, L, M, N, O, R, S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>U</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>A, O</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>V</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>P</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>W</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>C, M, V</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Y</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Z</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>(wild)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>* (wild)</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Q, X</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
