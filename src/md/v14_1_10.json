Goldenson and Kenneth N. Anderson, (Pharos Books, 1986), 314pp.</p>\n<p>[A VERBATIM Book Club Selection]</p>\n<p>The first thing I noticed in the Foreword (after\nthe announcement that this book contains 5,000\nterms) was that <em>freudian</em> was spelt with a small F.I\ndoubt it.  However, I have no reason to doubt anything\nelse recorded in this dictionary of sexology, which contains\nquite straightforward definitions of any sexual\nterm I could think of, plus a number that had never\noccurred to me and I had not encountered—I almost\nwrote “come across”!—in my meanderings through\nthe English language.  This is the sort of book where\none finds entries which move him to say “Do people\nreally do <em>that</em>?!”  By this time, with contraceptives\nbeing advertised openly on television, we seem to be\nletting it all hang out (if you will excuse the expression),\nand none of us is likely to be surprised by\nanything.  Gone are the days when one might have\nmistaken “condominium” for a tiny contraceptive, or\n<em>condom</em> as a small condominium.</p>\n<p>Yet, to those uninitiated into the liberal society\n(and its open description), revelations are to be found\nin the pages of <em>The Language of Sex</em>.  Many of the\nterms defined are anatomical, pathological, medical,\nor psychiatric, but those aren't the interesting ones.  I\nam not alone, I suppose, in assuming that once people\nhave devised a name for something, it must be sufficiently\ncommon.  To be sure, there are one-time occurrences\nthat are talked and written about enough to\nwarrant their being given a name, like <em>Watergate</em>.  But\nit seems unlikely to me that anyone would give something\na name unless it had to be discussed.  Thus, like\nother people, I am occasionally brought up short by\ncertain linguistic discoveries, and I found a few such\ndocumentations of kinkiness in this book.  Here is one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>candy pants</em> a commercial term for edible\npanties—Bikini pants that are made out of sweet\nmaterial, for example, cherry-flavored “fabric”\nwith licorice string ties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hate to show my naïveté, but <em>Wow</em>! A <em>commercial</em>\nterm?  That means that there are businesses out\nthere <em>making</em> these things! I am impressed.  Everyone\nknows about the drug subculture and terms like <em>crack</em>.\nDoes everyone except me know about <em>candy pants</em>?\nHow about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>TV style</em> a slang term for intercourse in “doggie\nfashion”: Both can watch TV.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Undoubtedly that practice must have a profound\neffect on a show's Nielsen ratings.  An interesting entry\nis <em>tabooness rating of dirty words</em>, too long to repeat\nhere: I found it as a cross reference when browsing\nthrough the entry for <em>son of a bitch. POSSLQ</em> 'partners\nof the opposite sex sharing living quarters' is here\nbut not <em>tallyman</em> or <em>tallywoman</em>, which, though not\nslang, are terms for the same thing that have been in\nthe language for hundreds of years.  There is also the\nconvenient adverb <em>tally</em>, as in to <em>live tally</em> 'to live\ntogether as husband and wife though not married (to\none another).'</p>\n<p>Gastronomic references occur, as in <em>fish</em> and\n<em>onions</em> “a culinary concoction designed to ensure an\nerotic reaction...”</p>\n<p>I don't mean to give the impression that the <em>Dictionary</em>\nis either a joke book or a manual of obscenity:\nit is somewhat erotic in the sense that each alphabetic\ninitial is decorated with a stylized illustration of two\nor more Orientals engaged in a sexual act, though decorously\nclothed.  (Why Indians and Japanese seem to\nsymbolize “clean” sex to westerners is beyond me, but\nthere are no westerners represented: too close to\nhome?)  Nevertheless, it treats its subject with decorum,\nin an informative, direct style; the definitions are\nexcellent, and there is nothing offensive about the\nbook at all.  Moralists, prudes, and others of prurient\ninclination should note (from the definition for <em>perversion</em>):\n“... sexologists tend to avoid the terms perversion\nand perverted, as well as deviant, deviation\nand 'unnatural,' preferring the less judgmental and\nmore neutral descriptive terms variation and variant.”\nThe approach is clinical and sensible.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
