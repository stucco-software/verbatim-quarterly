But I was surprised, upon reading <em>Time's</em> review of this dictionary [June 24, 1991], to realize that there were issues raised there that were not touched upon in VERBATIM. I wish attention had been given to these rather than some of those to which space was devoted, ones I consider of less consequence, such as the use of the name <em>Webster,</em> the dating of words such as ordinals, and the cost of the dictionary in per-word terms—and the cost of college dictionaries in general. While each of these subjects is of interest, they pale in comparison to the central issued raised in the <em>Time</em> review, namely of whether a dictionary is better simply because it has more words in it, words which are included if only to mirror the language of the moment, e.g. <em>womyn</em> (<em>pl</em>.), herstory, waitron, and <em>Mirandize</em>.</p>\n<p>In short, just because a new word has been coined does not mandate its publication in dictionaries in the frequency to which we have become victim over the past thirty-odd years. I have no statistics to back me up, but it is my impression that, as the rate of publication of English dictionaries has increased over the past few decades, the fabrication of new words has similarly increased. A kind of Parkinson's Law may be in effect here: words will increase in number to occupy the pages publishers are willing to print. Meanwhile, can we not say that accurate use of the language has declined, both in the meaning of words and in their syntax?

Perhaps, because it probably serves most students as the single source for such matters, it should also include those addenda which, in <em>Webster's 9th,</em> consume 188 pages, e.g. a list of abbreviations, a gazetteer, etc. However, let it become cluttered with etymologies, essays, and vocabulary that, I think, belong in more encyclopedic tomes and published at less frequent intervals, and the result is a cumbersome volume that I, for one, would not be inclined to use as the handy reference a “college” dictionary implies.</p>\n<p>Would a lexicographer agree?</p>\n<p><em>[Robert F.
