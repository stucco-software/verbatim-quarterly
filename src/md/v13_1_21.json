Mr. Peterson is a healthy,\nrobust man in his early 40s.  Never a sick day in his\nlife.  Never saw a doctor (nor did a doctor ever see\nhim).  Last year he purchased, strictly for his personal\nuse, a word processor, and he became thoroughly\nfascinated with the many magnificent facilities his\nsoftware offered—insertions, deletions, margin justification,\nparagraph reforming, moving parts of a sentences\nor entire blocks of typed matter to new places in\nthe text, etc., and all of this without having to erase or\nretype the entire “document” (as they call it in computerese).\nHe found new energies and reasons to start\na wide correspondence with old chums from his H. S.\ndays, from college, and with many other old friends\nfrom whom he had not heard in ages.</p>\n<p>Mr. Peterson does not know the touch system\nand, naturally, has to hunt-and-peck, looking for each\nkey before striking.  But his fingers are very chubby,\nand every time he strikes a key he inadevertently also\ntouches the adjacent key.  As a result he has to delete in\npractically every word the extra unwanted letters.</p>\n<p>For these three reasons—typing his letters, checking\nthe typed matter on the monitor, and then continually\ncorrecting it—he spent hours and hours of his\nevenings at the word processor.  He also developed\nsevere eyestrain.  His wife, as well as his friends at the\noffice, suggested that he go for an eye examination.\n“It's a good idea,” they said, “especially after 40.”\nAlthough initially reluctant to see a doctor (“for the\nfirst time in my life,” Mr. Peterson kept saying) he\nmade an appointment with an eye specialist.  The ophthalmologist\ninquired into the nature of his eyestrain,\nhis line of work, and after examining his eyes with\nvarious instruments, asked him to read the Snellen\nChart on the wall, first with the right eye, then with\nthe left.  Mr. Peterson rattled off all the letters with\neither eye in no time:</p>\n<p>“Just amazing,” the doctor said.  “If it were not\nfor one single error, the same error several times—you\nread <em>k</em> each time there was an <em>f</em>—you would have been\nletter-perfect.  Just to make sure, let's check your eyesight\nonce more.  However, to rule out any possible\npractice effects, please read the chart this time from\nthe smallest letters at the bottom upwards.”  The procedure\nwas repeated, again first with one eye, then\nwith the other.  But, lo and behold, Mr. Peterson made\nthe very same mistakes again: each time there was an\n<em>f</em>—a total of four times—he saw a <em>k</em>.</p>\n<p>The doctor turned on the light in the examination\nroom, and shook his head in disbelief.  After scribbling\nsome notes in the patient's file, he said:  “In all my\nyears of practice I encountered many patients with\nperfect 20/20 vision.  But never before did I have a\npatient with 20/10 visual acuity.  Just amazing!  Such a\nunique case should be written up in the 'Annals of\nOphthalmology.' ”  Then, after a moment of silence:\n“But there is one thing that puzzles me, Mr. Peterson.\nWhy is it that every time you come to the letter <em>f</em> you\nsee <em>k</em>?...”</p>\n<h2></h2>",
