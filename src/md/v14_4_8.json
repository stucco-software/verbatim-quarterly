The former is a\nlarge (8½” × 11”) work of almost 900 pages arranged in\ncalendar order and with a detailed index; it lists all\nkinds of important holidays in all countries of the world\nand offers a brief chronology of the major events that\ntook place on each day; it ranges from religious, historical,\nand political days to promotional items, like National\nLaugh Week.  For its avowed purpose, it is probably\nthe most comprehensive work available.  The old\n<em>Book of Days</em> lists far fewer holidays and anniversaries\nbut gives interesting (if not always accurate) descriptions\nof their origins.  The first is a reference book, the\nsecond a fascinating browsing medium.</p>\n<p>Leslie Dunkling's book is not like either of the\nabove.  It does have a calendar in the back, but that\nlists only the relatively few days the author has selected\nfor treatment in the main body of the book, where\nthey are listed by name, in alphabetical order.  For\nthose benighted few who are unfamiliar with\nDunkling's works, they include the <em>Guinness Book of\nNames, First Names First, Everyman's Dictionary of\nFirst Names, You Name It!</em>, and, with Gordon Wright,\n<em>A Dictionary of Pub Names</em>.  The last, as far as I know,\nhas not been published in the U.S.  To make a long\nstory short, Dunkling is an onomasiologist or onomastician,\nand president of the Names Society, a U.K.\ncounterpart (in more modest guise) of the American\nName Society.</p>\n<p>The number of entries in the book (850, according\nto the jacket blurb) may seem a bit sparse, but they\nmake up in quality what they lack in quantity.  The list\nis eclectic, covering the days important to people in the\nU.K., Commonwealth, and the U.S.  It contains not\nonly “real” days (like <em>gaudy day, Geranium Day, German\nDay, Gesuffa Day</em> [See TOAST 'N JELLY DAY], and\n<em>Girl Scout Day</em>, but <em>Gloomy Sunday</em> (after the lugubrious\nsong of the same name, which I had not known\nwas of Hungarian origin), <em>insipid day</em>, and <em>Teacher for\na Day Day</em>.  Nights, like <em>Thump-the-door Night</em> and\n<em>Burns Night</em> are there as well as anything else one\nmight think up having to do with <em>day, night</em>, the\nnames of the days of the week, and other associated\nreferences, including <em>busman's holiday</em>.  All the information\nis set forth in a clear, straightforward style;\nknowing Dunkling's meticulous scholarship, I assume\nthe facts are as accurate as available evidence permits.\nMy only criticism of the book is that it lacks an index.\nThe calendar in the back, already mentioned, serves as\na kind of chronological index, but there is much good\nmaterial buried in the entries which, once one has\nread through the text, remains almost inaccessible to\nthose who haven't memorized it.  This is the kind of\nreference book one reads through, cover to cover; but\nif readers recall a detail, mentioned in an entry, to\nwhich they want to refer again weeks, months, or\nyears later, the absence of an index will stymie them.\nHow experienced publishers of reference books, like\nRoutledge and Facts On File, can allow such a work to\nbe published without an index is a mystery.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
