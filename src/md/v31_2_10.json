She seemed very nice, especially given the fact that she was middle-aged and waiting in line to purchase tickets for her 20-something son (who had been unable to take off work). And indeed she was nice—and interesting. We talked about lots of things: she told me that, as a young woman, she had worked construction in Texas in the 60s, had studied anthropology, had two kids, had faith in feminism. I told her that I was a sociolinguist. “Oh?” she said and I thought to myself, “If ever there was a time that I could enlighten a fellow being about descriptive linguistics, it is now.” So I began my comparison of “Standard English” and Santa Claus, both of which exist only as judgment-making social constructs, both used to label people as 'naughty' or 'nice.' She didn't believe me. I talked about the nature of language and how both change and variation are part of the deal. She resisted. I talked about the fact that all dialects are rule-governed, structured entities that deserved respect. She was adamant. I was shocked. More so, however, when she began to divulge her own passionate belief, not only in the efficacy of Standard English, but also in the 'true story of humankind's origins.' She explained that aliens put humans on this planet 3,000 years ago to work as genetically engineered slaves whose job it is to mine gold from seawater. In addition, as part of a never-ending cycle, our alien masters would soon be returning to earth in order to wipe our planet clean and start again, as we have lately forgotten our ultimate purpose in being here <em>(i.e.,</em> to extract gold from seawater). The evidence, she said, is in the pyramids. In summary, I would like to remind you that this woman would not accept for a second, or even consider, the idea that Standard English is merely a concept, that linguistic variation is natural, that all dialects are equally valid means of communication, and yet, gold from seawater, folks, gold from seawater.</p>",
