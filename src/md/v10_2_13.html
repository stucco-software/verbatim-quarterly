<p>In “Meretricious Words” [VIII, 3] Bryan Garner explained,
<em>hooker</em>: 'one who hooks or entraps, often in a happy manner';
20th century.  Then Frank E. Day [IX, 1] proposed that the
usage began during the Civil War when Gen. Hooker allegedly
received prostitutes in his quarters.  Garland Hicks [IX, 3]
suggested that the term referred to camp followers in general,
and not specifically the ones allegedly enjoyed by Gen. Hooker
personally.</p>
<p>The prostitutes may have been called <em>hookers</em>, but the
term predates the Civil war, and Gen. Hooker should not carry
the etymological burden.  The homographical coincidence of his
name and the slang term was undoubtedly the source of coarse
humor and the stories related by Day and Hicks.</p>
<p>From the <em>DAE</em>:</p>
<p><em>Hook</em> (Perhaps influenced by Du. <em>hoek</em>, 'corner,'
'nook.'</p>
<p>A sharp bend in the course of a river or channel
{1670 }... 1848 Bartlett 179: This name is given in
New York to several angular points in the North and
East rivers; as, <em>Corlear's Hook, Sandy Hook, Powles's
Hook</em>....</p>
<p><em>The Hook</em>: A district in New York City [situated at the
southwest corner of Manhattan island and bounded on
the south and west by Corlear's hook of the East
river]... <em>Hooker</em>: 1859 Bartlett 201.  A resident of the
Hook, i.e. a strumpet, a sailor's trull.  So called from the
number of houses of ill-fame frequented by sailors at
the Hook (i.e., Corlear's Hook) in the city of New
York...</p>
<p>John Russell Bartlett was a lexicographer, bibliographer,
and ethnologist.  <em>A Dictionary of Americanisms: A Glossary of
Words and Phrases Usually Regarded as Peculiar to the United
States</em> was a standard work of reference 1st ed., 1848, New
York; 2d ed., 1859, Boston; 3d ed., 1860, Boston; 4th ed., 1877,
Boston.  He was a contemporary of the John Bartlett who
compiled <em>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations</em>.</p>
<p>Some etymologists accept Bartlett; others are skeptical of
colorful etymologies and note that the earliest citation refers to
a red-light district in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
<p>In a letter dated Nov. 18, 1845, written at Edenton, North
Carolina, by T. Houghton, a student at the University of North
Carolina, he advised a friend that <em>“if</em> he comes by way of
Norfolk he will find any number of pretty Hookers, in the Brick
row not far from French's hotel” (Norman Eliason, <em>Tar Heel
Talk</em>, Chapel Hill, 1956, pp. 71, 124, 129, 277).</p>
<p>The writer capitalized the word <em>Hookers</em>, which suggests
that it is derived from a proper name, the Hook (district); but
it isn't compelling because he also capitalized <em>Brick</em>.</p>
<p>However, if Bartlett was correct, it is certain that the
word would have been delivered at once to Norfolk by
merchant seaman.  Virtually all commercial and personal travel
was by water.  New York City was the largest city, largest port,
and the commercial center of the U. S. Norfolk then had more
maritime commerce and shipping than any other town in
Virginia and was the port for the northern part of North
Carolina.</p>
<p>Also, sailors of the U. S. Navy would have circulated the
term.  The huge Brooklyn Navy Yard was established on
Wallabout Bay in 1824 and was about one half mile south of
the Hook.  In Bishop Davenport's <em>Gazetteer</em>, New York, 1842,
the entry for Norfolk includes, “The handsome marine hospital
is on Washington Point, one mile distant, and a short distance
up the river is a large U.S. navy-yard.”</p>
