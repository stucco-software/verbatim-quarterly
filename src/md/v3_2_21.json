He may be a little too categorical, however, in stating that, unlike Germanic, “the Romance languages virtually forbid it.”  True, the practice is not indigenous to Romance, nor is it as versatile.  (That is, with the debatable exception of Esperanto--of largely Romance lexicon but generally Germanic syntax--in which one can agglutinate nouns almost ad lib. E.g., the nouns <em>pluvo</em> 'rain,' <em>mantelo</em> 'coat,' <em>fabriko</em> 'factory,' and <em>loko</em> 'location' are easily combined to form a perfectly comprehensible chain: <em>pluvmantelfabrikloko</em>.  But such a process is typical of the language and leads neither to obfuscation nor affectation.)  French has been quite hospitable to noun pairs for some time--with or without hyphens, often capriciously--and is becoming even more so as the language suffers from the spread of its own equivalent of Newspeak, ironically dubbed <em>Hexagonal</em>.  Except for some chic Anglo-American calques like <em>auto-école</em> 'driving school,' such pairs differ from the Germanic variety in that the qualifying noun always follows the qualified, not vice-versa.  Hence <em>homme</em> 'man' + <em>grenouille</em> 'frog' for 'frogman.'  They can be broken down into (at least) three types:  &gt;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>True appositions, in which the second (qualifying) noun plays the role of a predicate adjective; as in <em>soldat citoyen</em> 'citizen soldier,' <em>homme orchestre</em> 'one-man band,' et al.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metaphorical appositions, as in <em>homme grenouille, guerre éclair</em> 'lightning war,' i.e. 'Blitzkrieg,' <em>roman fleuve</em> 'saga,' lit.  'river novel,' <em>homme sandwich</em> 'sandwich man,' i.e. in the ambulatory, publicity sense, et al.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Syntactical ellipses, in which simple juxtaposition replaces anything from a preposition to an entire phrase. Thus, <em>café-concert</em> (for a <em>café</em> where one can also hear a <em>concert</em> of sorts), <em>bloc-notes</em> 'note-pad,' <em>coiffeur hommes</em> 'men's barber,' <em>pause café</em> 'coffee break,' the slang <em>arrêt pipi</em> 'rest stop,' et al.
