Carver's “Etymology as Educated Guess” [XIX,1] I could not help thinking that non-English peoples may have practised “Etymology as folk guess” with regard to at least some English words brought to them by their colonizers.

The story goes that the Malayalam <em>kaśuvanti</em> became <em>cashew nut</em> in the market when an Englishman asked a vendor the price of the nuts in his basket. The vendor replied, “Kāśinettu,” 'eigth for a farthing' in rough translation. The Englishman, the story insists, who knew no word for the nut until then, mistook the quoted price for the Malayalam word for it.

The cashew-nut tale itself is probably as recent as the 19th century, although facts of recorded history in both English and Malayalam tell us different stories. The Malayalam <em>kaśuvanti</em> probably derived from the Portuguese word for it since <em>Hobson-Jobson</em> observes that cashew, “the tree, fruit or nut of <em>Anacardium occidentale</em>,” must have been introduced to the Indians by the Portuguese. Vasco da Gama and his fellow navigators first landed in Calicut in Kerala (and India) in 1498. As for the English word, <em>OED2e</em> records its root as French <em>acajou</em> and its first use as early as 1703.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
