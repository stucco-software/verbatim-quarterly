And don't forget the Indians, some of whose\nleaders are quite rightly asking to be spoken of as “Native\nAmericans”—precisely for the purpose of reminding the rest\nof us of the ethnic sequences in populating this continent.</p>\n<p>America has never been successful as a melting pot unless\none interprets that metaphor in a culinary, rather than a\nmetallurgical, sense.  To the extent that we have become a\ncultural unit, we are like a good Oriental dinner cooked in a\n<em>wok</em>, with each bit of vegetable and meat retaining its own\nidentity while contributing to the delightful nature of the\nwhole.</p>\n<p>The tone of Mr. Urdang's article makes me think he may\nhave been suffering from the temporary effects of a less well-prepared\nrepast, which someone called a <em>meal</em> and set before\nhim with a “There you go!” and a “Have a good day!”  I do\nhope he's feeling better now.</p>\n<p><em>[Sam Hinton, School Relations Officer University of California, San Diego].</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
