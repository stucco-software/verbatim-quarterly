Sometimes the results\nare amusing to those of us sufficiently stunted intellectually to\nenjoy such nonsense.  It may not be abundantly clear why\nanyone should indulge in this sort of tomfoolery, but in the\ndays when Pig Latin flourished, the first step in forming the\nalloporc was, while essentially phonetic, a process similar to the\naberration being indulged in here.  A swinified <em>dice</em>, e.g., would\nbe something like <em>ice-day</em>.  One hesitates to write Pig Latin, for\nit never achieved a kosher orthography.  People <em>ont-day itewray\nig-pay atin-lay</em>.  Unlike words in <em>Latina porcina</em>, primults\ndo not add an element; they merely put the first (<em>prim</em>-)\nelement last (-<em>ult</em>).  Protohyst is merely a Greek synonym.  They\nare no respecters of phonetic shapes; the new orthographic\nform—the spelling—is everything.  Thus the primult of <em>dice</em> is\n<em>iced</em>, which preserves quite a lot of the phonetic content, while\nthe primult of <em>heart is earth</em>, which does violence to practically\neverything but the r (assuming it is present in one's speech).\nSome other primults of moderate interest include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>drake: raked<br>\nebon: bone<br>\nether: there<br>\newe: wee<br>\nflea: leaf<br>\ngelatin: elating<br>\nheight: eighth<br>\nkin: ink<br>\nlow: owl<br>\nmalar: alarm<br>\nmite: item<br>\nplum: lump<br>\nrave: aver<br>\nruse: user<br>\nsaddle: addles<br>\nsharp: harps<br>\nspew: pews<br>\ntar: art<br>\nthin: hint<br>\ntough: ought<br>\ntrap: rapt<br>\nwane: anew</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The cheapest primults are those derived from words with\ninitial s, because that letter is so frequent, both initially and\nfinally, in English that we can find dozens of primults of such\nwords almost without effort, for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>scream: creams<br>\nscrew: crews<br>\nscud: cuds<br>\nsewer: edges<br>\nsewer: ewers<br>\nshade: Hades (with obviously no respect for the integrity of <em>sh = s</em>)                sink: inks<br>\nshare: hares<br>\nsherd: herds<br>\nship: hips<br>\nshoe: hoes<br>\nshook: hooks<br>\nshorn: horns<br>\nshovel: hovels<br>\nshunt: hunts<br>\nskid: kids<br>\nskill: kills<br>\nslake: lakes<br>\nslaughter: laughters<br>\nslumber: lumbers<br>\nsmother: mothers<br>\nspawn: pawn<br>\nspill: pills<br>\nspoke: pokes<br>\nspun: puns<br>\nsputter: putters<br>\nstale: tales<br>\nstart: tarts<br>\nstinker: tinkers<br>\nstrumpet: trumpets<br>\nswaddle: waddles<br>\nswallow: wallows<br>\nsword: words</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We could add to the list, but it is almost shamefully easy,\ndespite some titillating overtones.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we can imagine a semantic link between a\nword and its primultimate twist, but the connection is usually\nfar-fetched.  We may try to <em>cope</em> with <em>Opec</em>, and one may tire of\n<em>stale tales</em>.  It would be pandering to <em>start tarts</em>.  The pub rarely\nhas a <em>sale</em> on <em>ales</em>.  Yet <em>evil</em> is not too different from <em>vile</em>, and\n<em>scat</em> is a word for some <em>cats</em>.  A swallowed <em>plum</em> may produce a\n<em>lump</em>.  Along the <em>Isar</em> I sometimes have seen a <em>sari</em>.  A <em>ramble</em>\nmay well be enjoyed by an <em>ambler</em>.  My hair resembles <em>sedge</em>\naround the <em>edges</em>; on <em>top</em> I must <em>opt</em> for a smoother simile.  A\nclassical <em>shade</em> is assigned a spot in <em>Hades</em>, and by its <em>side</em>,\nperhaps, is that of one slain on the <em>Ides</em>.  Cattle may be <em>shorn</em> of\ntheir <em>horns</em>.  Don't <em>shoot</em> everything that <em>hoots</em>; a <em>low owl</em> may\nbe the victim.  There is <em>sparse</em> likelihood of a class that <em>parses</em>\nthese days.  A <em>smart</em> shopper could look for <em>marts</em> in <em>small</em>\nmalls.  It takes <em>spunk</em> to stand up to <em>punks</em>.  A <em>stumble</em> should be\navoided by one who <em>tumbles</em>.  Much wounding can be done by\nthe <em>sword</em> of <em>words</em>.</p>\n<p>Stingy primults can be formed from petty words like <em>has,\n(ash), the (het), hug (ugh!), sit (its), yam (Amy), two (wot)</em>, and\nthe like.  In rare cases a second primult can be formed, yielding\na sequence of three barely or boringly connected words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>eon: one: neo<br>\nIda: Dai: aid<br>\nLevi: evil: vile<br>\nrave: aver: Vera<br>\nsera (pl. of <em>serum</em>): eras: rase<br>\nside: Ides: Desi<br>\nspa: pas: asp<br>\nstern: terns: Ernst (?)<br>\ntea: eat: ate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But in these there is considerable cheating with names, etc.  A\nsequence of four was not found.</p>\n<p>The first shall be last.  Perhaps only a <em>stinker tinkers</em> like\nthis with our sacred words.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
