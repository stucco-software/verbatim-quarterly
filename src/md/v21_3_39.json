Constantine</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">New York City</span></em></p>\n<p><em>Misuta Kôdo</em> 'Mr. Cord,' <em>sannadabichi</em> 'son of the “bitchy”,' <em>hando pampingu</em> 'hand pumping,' <em>fakku-mêto'</em>: visit a Tokyo high school, and you will quickly realize that much of the fast-flowing teen lingo is in actual fact English. Inventive puns and coded metaphors abound, and new words, phrases, and grammatical twists surface each year. What was <em>naui</em> “now”—'cool, awesome, rad'—a year ago is suddenly <em>annui</em>—“un-new”— 'definitely out, uncool, weak.' Those who dare to use last year's words find themselves ostracized by their clique-mates.</p>\n<p>When teens congregate in tough inner-city schoolyards, their roughneck slang is called <em>agotataki</em> 'chin banging.' And each year, as a new generation of chins bang, ever more inspired English words surface: <em>son-play, me-man, C.I.A., CD boy, cassette boy, super-candy, wrestling, bible game</em>.</p>\n<p>“But where do all these eccentric English words come from?” the confused observer might ask. The answer is that they are not English words but English-inspired words, inspired by expressions heard on television and by half-understood words picked up in English class, then bandied about with tilted semantics.</p>\n<p><em>Son-play,</em> for instance, is 'masturbation.' Take <em>musuko</em> 'son,' the standard Japanese slang word for penis, translate it into English, add <em>play</em>, and you have a sprightly and newfangled neologism. When tough modern girls say <em>me-man</em>, they mean 'my vagina': the <em>me-</em> part is from the English <em>me</em> (for 'my') and <em>man</em> is short for <em>manko</em> 'vagina.'</p>\n<p>The initials C.I.A. are a form of S.O.S., used by girls who are caught unawares by their period. The deceptive letters stand for <em>Chotto Ima Are!</em> 'That just came!' A <em>CD boy</em> is a boy who is one hundred per cent straight: CDs play on only one side; a <em>cassette boy</em> has bisexual interests.</p>\n<p>Among the rougher teens, <em>super-candy</em> means a 'good blow-job,' and <em>wrestling</em> is a synonym for 'violent and coerced sex.'</p>\n<p><em>Tosuto</em> (toast), another popular word of nebulous background means 'jealousy': toasting bread in Japanese is known as <em>pan o yakeru;</em> the verb <em>yakeru</em> 'toast, bake, scorch' is also used in standard Japanese for 'jealousy'; the teenagers computed: 'burning with jealousy ... burning ... burning bread ... toasting ... toast.</p>\n<p>Another powerful source of new expressions is the English alphabet, where letters, alone or in secret configurations, are used to convey hidden messages:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>AAS:</em> Aitakute Aitakute Shigata ga nai. 'I want to meet him, I want to meet him, what am I to do?'</p>\n<p><em>TDK:</em> Tende Dame na Ko. 'totally gross guy/ girl'</p>\n<p><em>HT:</em> Half Think 'One-sided love'</p>\n<p><em>HB:</em> Honto ni Busu 'plug-ugly'</p>\n<p><em>F:</em> Feminine 'Beautiful girl'</p>\n<p><em>FM:</em> Fuck Mate</p>\n<p><em>SM:</em> Sex Mate</p>\n<p><em>M:</em> Masturbation; Masochist</p>\n<p><em>CS:</em> Car Sex</p>\n<p><em>IC:</em> Instant Couple</p>\n<p><em>BF:</em> Boy Friend</p>\n<p><em>GF:</em> Girl Friend</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>New words can also be created by playing with metaphors. <em>Fakku</em> 'fuck' is used quite innocently to refer to a major frontal collision between two vehicles, while in the gentler <em>kissu</em> 'kiss' the cars just bump lightly. <em>Bûmeran</em> 'boomerang' is the dumped lover who incessantly keeps returning, and <em>morumon</em> 'mormon' is the active high-schooler with multiple girlfriends. <em>Bonuresu hamu</em> 'boneless ham' is a school girl with a figure like a chunk of boneless ham.</p>\n<p>The metaphor comes in particularly handy when conversations turn to matters of delicacy. Tampons, for instance, can be delicately referred to with English words such as 'tea-bag' <em>tiibagu</em>, 'cracker' <em>kuraka</em>, 'wireless microphone' <em>wairesumaiku,</em> or 'vanilla (ice-cream cone)' <em>banira</em>. Another taboo subject, condoms, can be touched on with playful metaphors such as: 'globe' <em>gurôbu,</em> 'raincoat' <em>reinkôto,</em> or 'cover for Mr. John' <em>jon-kun kaba</em>.</p>\n<p>An even more idiosyncratic trend has been to spawn new blends by using syllabus of Japanese words with English syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>shite-bôi</em> 'horny adolescent': Japanese <em>shitê</em> 'wants to do' + English <em>bôi</em> 'boy'</p>\n<p><em>orudo-busu</em> 'ugly old bitch': English 'old' (<em>ôrudo) + busu</em> 'plug-ugly'</p>\n<p><em>gyaru-bôi</em> 'effeminate schoolboy': <em>gyaru</em> 'girl + <em>bôi</em> 'boy'</p>\n<p><em>gyaru-oyaji</em> 'girl daddy': middle-aged man with the airs and interests of a teenage girl'</p>\n<p><em>tero-ko</em> 'violent teen': <em>tero</em>, English 'terror' + <em>ko</em> 'child'</p>\n<p><em>oran-kori</em> 'without a date': <em>oran</em> 'no one's there' + <em>kori</em>, the “-choly” part of <em>melancholy</em></p>\n<p><em>urutora-naon</em> 'a woman with large breasts':</p>\n<p><em>urutora</em> 'ultra' + <em>naon</em>, a playful inversion of <em>onna</em> 'woman'</p>\n<p><em>masu-kagami</em> 'masturbating in front of a mirror': “mas-” of <em>masturbation</em> (pronounced “<em>masutabeeshon&gt;”) + kagami</em> 'mirror'; it is also a fertile pun on the title of the medieval Japanese classic, <em>Masukagami</em>, “The Pillow Book,” by Sei Shonagen</p>\n<p><em>bai-nara</em> “Bye, see you later': <em>Bye + Sayonara</em>; Sometimes pronounced <em>“bayonara”</em></p>\n<p><em>mesu-teriku</em> 'neurotic bitch': <em>mesu</em> 'female' + the <em>“-teric”</em> of <em>hysteric</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rapid spread of the American fast-food mania brought with it even more eccentric words of English extraction: <em>nakkuru</em>, short for <em>snack-uru</em> 'to snack,' <em>chii-too</em> 'cheese toast,' <em>ai-ko</em> 'iced coffee,' <em>aitii</em> 'iced tea,' and <em>ai-mi-tii</em> for 'iced mint tea.'</p>\n<p><em>Kentucky Fried Chicken</em> appears in teen slang as <em>Kencha no Furachin</em>, which produced the verb <em>kencharu</em>, 'to hang out after school at a Kentucky Fried.' <em>Hageru</em> means 'to go and get some Häagen Dazs ice cream.' <em>Denny's</em> was playfully changed into <em>zudenii</em>, and <em>Mr. Donut</em> became <em>misudo</em>.</p>\n<p>The single most successful fast-food operation in Japan has been Macdonald's. Since 1971 the chain has mushroomed nationwide into over 1200 stores. High-schoolers call <em>Macdonald's makudo</em>, or <em>makku</em> for short, and eating the burgers is succinctly known as <em>makkuru</em>.</p>\n<p>The most sensitive among this foreign batch of words is <em>bible play</em>, a clever metaphor imported into high-school slang from red-light clubs and porn tapes and magazines. <em>Bible</em>, pronounced BYEBURU, is a playful extension of <em>baibu</em> 'vibe,' short for <em>vibrator</em>.</p>\n<p>The Japanese club crowd is astonished at the flash flood of new expressions that year after year pour out of the schools and surge through Tokyo's trendy computer-game centers and fast-food hangouts. Even today's twenty-somethings, still hot on the club scene with their flamboyant teen slang from the late eighties, find it hard to keep up with the latest waves.</p>\n<p>One of the most inventive sources for neologisms is the cross-cultural pun: the expression that pretends to be English but is in fact Japanese. A <em>white kick</em>, for instance, is a 'killjoy': the teens took the Japanese <em>shirakeru</em> 'to be a killjoy,' split the word in two, and ended up with <em>shira</em> 'white' and <em>keru</em> 'kick.' <em>Parkinson</em> means 'gullible, a push-over': it is a contraction of <em>pâ de kin o son suru</em> 'Losing money out of sheer stupidity.'</p>\n<h1></h1>",
