Emblen's diatribe about <em>prequel</em> falls short.</p>\n<p>First, while my CD–ROM version of the <em>Random House Unabridged</em> [<em>RHUD</em>] isn't dated prior to 1992, it does date the term to 1970-75.</p>\n<p>Second, my 1982 <em>OED Supplement,</em> volume III, is dated prior to 1992 by a full decade and lists <em>prequel</em>: “A book, film, etc., the events portrayed in which or the concerns of which precede those of an existing completed work.”</p>\n<p>1973 <em>Britannica Bk. of the Year</em> 1972 732–3 “<em>Prequel,</em> a literary work whose narrative sequentially precedes that of an earlier work.” 1997 <em>National Observer</em> [U.S.] 1 Jan. 1–4 Cammer has just written a book, <em>Freedom from Compulsion</em> . . . He calls it a 'prequel' to his earlier book, <em>Up from Depression</em>. '“Prequel is a word I coined,” he explains. “It's a sequel except it's on a subject that comes before.” 1977 <em>Globe &amp; Mail</em> [Toronto] 17 Sept. 37/5 <em>The Silmarillion,</em> for which Tolkien coined the term <em>Prequel,</em> describes not only the creation of Middle Earth, but of the universe. 1979 <em>Films &amp; Filming</em> Mar. 11 In this 'prequel' Tom Berenger stars as Butch Cassidy and William Katt as Sundance.</p>\n<p>Third, the usage reported in the <em>Washington Post,</em> “The sequel takes up where the prequel left off” seems misguided, if not erroneous. A film or book to which a prequel exists, is not a sequel. My <em>RHUD</em> defines a <em>sequel</em> as “a literary work, movie, etc., that is complete in itself but continues the narrative of a preceding work.”</p>\n<p>Hence the book or film which takes up where the prequel left off isn't a sequel at all, because IT was the preceding work. I don't know of a term that means the existing work whose events those of a prequel precedes, but <em>sequel</em> certainly isn't it. The first “Star Wars” movie was not a sequel, though it has a prequel (and also a sequel). So, the <em>Washington Post</em> notwithstanding, there is something between the prequel and the sequel.</p>\n<p>Finally, I wonder how D. L. Emblen feels about the year 1 B.C.E. being followed by the year 1 C.E. without a year inbetween. I don't think this leads into any troubling philosophical waters, despite the number of people who seem convinced that the 21st century began on 1 January 2000.</p>\n<p>[<em>Benjamin H.
