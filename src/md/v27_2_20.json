Cardman</span></h1>\n<p>Dear Ms. McKean: [To you from me]:</p>\n<p>Perhaps the grammatical mavens among VERBATIM readers can explain what I consider an extremely vexing writing style in <em>The New York Times.</em> Invariably, when discussing a change over time, a <em>Times</em> journalist states it in the order: “to x from y.” For example: “In the last ten years salaries have changed to $10 an hour from $8.50.” Or, “The population center has migrated to the southeast from the northeast.”</p>\n<p>I find this extremely disconcerting. I am completely programmed to consider change chronologically, from the past to the present, not to the present from the past. And when an article is discussing percentage changes over time, I actually have to stop and think through what the writer is implying, whether 'decreasing to' or 'increasing to' from 'the past amount.' Am I the only person who finds this disconcerting and unintuitive?</p>\n<p>Consider how such a policy rewrites the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To Eternity From Here</p>\n<p>To nuts from soup.</p>\n<p>“ . . . to shining sea from sea”</p>\n<p>“ . . . to the home of the brave from the land of the free”</p>\n<p>“To earth from earth, to ashes from ashes, to dust from dust . . .”</p>\n<p>“Creeps in this petty pace to the last syllable of record time to day from day . . .”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does this disturb anyone else???</p>\n<p>[<em>Elizabeth R. Cardman, Urbana, Illinois</em>]</p>\n<p>[These could be called examples of <em>hysteron proteron</em> (also called <em>praeposteratio</em> or “the cart before the horse”), the reversal of a causal, logical, or chronological sequence. This is usually only recommended for the <em>in media res</em> approach to dramatic or narrative writing, so I have no idea why it's being used in these rather pedestrian surroundings in <em>The New York Times</em>. Perhaps the writers are bored?—Ed.]</p>\n<h2></h2>",
