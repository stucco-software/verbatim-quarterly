The list\ncomes to some 103, ranging from the most abundant\nand simplest of all, hydrogen, to the transuranic monsters,\nnobelium and lawrencium.</p>\n<p>Each has its name, for convenience, though these\nnames convey almost no interesting information about\nthe elements that bear them.  They are not even all internationally\nuniform: only the most technical and\nrecently adopted ones are roughly the same in almost\nall languages.  Each element also has an internationally\nadopted, standard symbol derived from a name; thus\nsome of these do not correspond to the name in most\nlanguages.  For example, the symbol <em>Fe</em> is used everywhere\nfor iron, the 26th element in the Periodic Table,\nbut that symbol is reminiscent of the name of this\ncommon metal only in Latin (<em>ferrum</em>) and languages\nderived from Latin (French <em>fer</em>).  But even Spanish\n<em>hierro</em> is already becoming opaque.</p>\n<p>It is easy to see why the names of roughly the\nsame list of elements fail to correspond from language\nto language.  These are by and large the elements for\nwhich there is likely to be a nonchemical, native, or\nold loan name.  Moreover, some languages have constructed\na few modern terms for others, especially\nwhen the element or its most familiar compounds are\nabundant or likely to be widely known.</p>\n<p>Thus, in a variety of unrelated languages, sulfur,\niron, copper, silver, tin, gold, mercury, and lead are\nvery likely to have native names; sometimes also zinc,\ncarbon, arsenic, and silicon.  The former eight were\nknown to some peoples prehistorically, and, except\nfor tin and mercury, are found in the free state in\nnature.</p>\n<p>Some native names are merely loan translations.\nThus, Russian <em>ugl,erod</em> and Hebrew <em>pahman</em> are\ncalques on German <em>Kohlenstoff</em> 'carbon,' derived respectively\nfrom <em>ugol</em>, and <em>peham</em> 'coal.'  The Japanese\ncharacters for mercury are <em>sui</em> for 'water' followed\nby <em>gin</em> for 'silver,' a perfect calque on the Greek:\n<em>hydrárgyros=hýdōr</em> 'water' + <em>árgyros</em> 'silver' (giving\nlatin <em>hydrargyrus</em>, hence the chemical symbol <em>Hg</em>).</p>\n<p>Hebrew even has a little series, mostly loan translations,\nsome new creations on a semantically similar\npattern: <em>zarhán</em> 'phosphorus' from <em>zeráh</em> 'shining' (<em>phōs</em>\n'light'), <em>sidán</em> 'calcium' from <em>sid</em> 'lime' (<em>calx</em> 'lime'),\n<em>ešlagan</em> 'potassium' from <em>ešlág</em> 'potash,' <em>tsorán</em> 'silicon'\nfrom <em>tsur</em> 'rock' (<em>silex</em> 'flint'), and <em>avnán</em> 'lithium' from\n<em>éven</em> 'stone' (<em>líthos</em> 'stone').</p>\n<p>Also, a few elements are named for common uses\nof a compound; thus, for arsenic Turkish can use (beside\nPersian-derived <em>zirník</em>) <em>sičánotu</em>, lit. 'shitter-herb,'\ni.e., 'rat poison' (a common name for the mouse and\nrat is <em>sičán</em> 'defecator').  Similarly, Russian has <em>myš,yak</em>,\nprobably derived from <em>myš</em> 'mouse' from the use of\narsenicals as rodent poisons.  Also, antimony is called\nin Turkish <em>sürmé taši</em> 'smearing stone' (also <em>antimon</em>)\nfrom the ancient use of stibium (mineral antimony\nsulfide) as an eye cosmetic.  Here Russian has borrowed\nthe Turkic verbal noun <em>sürmé</em> as <em>sur,ma</em> 'antimony.'\n(The W. Semitic name for this same Sb?\\2S?\\3, stibnite,\na lead-gray metallic mineral, in Hebrew <em>kohál</em>,\nArabic <em>al-kahl</em>, Aramaic <em>kuhlā</em>, etc., gave rise to a long\nsemantic development during alchemical times from\n'stibium eye-shadow' to 'fine powder' to 'essence' to\n'spirits of grape,' i.e., 'alcohol' = <em>al-kohl</em>.)</p>\n<p>Now, among the various borrowings and loan-translations\nfor element names there are two that incorporate\na kind of chemical confusion or misunderstanding,\npassed on from language to language, and\nauthorized by modern language academies, whose\nmembers ought to know better.</p>\n<p>The first is the name for nitrogen, element number\n7.  It was named <em>nitrogéne</em> in French by Jean-Antoine\nChaptal in 1790 as a compound of Greek\n<em>nítron</em> 'sodium carbonate' and -<em>genēs</em> 'born of, produced\nby.'  But what on earth is the connection between\nsodium carbonate, Na?\\2CO?\\3, or washing soda,\nand the relatively inert atmospheric gas nitrogen, N?\nSurely no chemical relation between soda and nitrogen\naccounts for Chaptal's choice.  The answer goes back\nto a confusion in the 16th Century between two alchemical\nnames used, e.g., by Ramón Lull (Raymondus\nLullius, c. 1235-1315).  Lull called soda <em>nitrum</em>,\nand he called saltpeter <em>sal nitri</em>.  His word <em>nitrum</em> (from\nLatin from Greek <em>nítron</em>) continued on, along with\n<em>nitre</em>, as names for saltpeter (from <em>sal petrae</em>), i.e.,\npotassium nitrate.  Another form, <em>natron</em>, is still used\nfor soda, i.e., sodium carbonate.  (The word <em>nitre</em>\n'KNO?\\3' is from French <em>nitre</em> from Latin <em>nitrum</em> from\nGreek <em>nítron</em> 'native Na?\\2CO?\\3, natron' from either\nEgyptian <em>ntry</em> or from Hebrew <em>néter</em>, cognate of Akkadian\n<em>nitiru</em>; the word <em>natron</em> is from Spanish <em>natrón</em>\nfrom Arabic <em>natrūn</em>; from Greek <em>nítron</em>.)</p>\n<p>The irony here is that French later itself avoided\nthe confusion when Lavoisier named the gas <em>azote</em>\n(from <em>a</em>- 'not' + <em>zōē</em> 'life') since he observed that\nnitrogen, the major component of air, will not itself\nsupport life.  Other languages either borrowed the\nFrench <em>azote</em> (e.g., Russian <em>azot</em>) or calqued it (e.g.,\nGerman <em>Stickstoff</em> 'choke-damp,' further calqued to\nHebrew <em>hanqán</em> from <em>héneq</em> 'suffocation').</p>\n<p>Finally, having straightened out French nitrogen\nto <em>azote</em>, Lavoisier himself now generated a new confusion\nwhich nearly everyone inherits today.  He\nstudied the other major atmospheric gas, oxygen, and\nits mate in water, hydrogen.  In 1787 he named the\nlatter <em>hydrogéne</em> for its origin in the decomposition of\nwater (from <em>hýdōr</em> 'water'), and that term is either\nborrowed into other languages (e.g., Turkish <em>idrojen</em>,\nHungarian <em>hidrogén</em>, or Arabic <em>idrūjīn</em>), or it is\ncalqued (e.g., Hebrew <em>maymán</em> from <em>máyim</em> 'water', or\nGerman <em>Wasserstoff</em>, or Russian <em>vodorod</em>, or Japanese\n<em>sui-so</em> 'water element').</p>\n<p>But, when creating a modern theory of combustion\nto replace the fanciful phlogiston theory, Lavoisier\ninvestigated the properties of oxides and of <em>oxygéne,</em>\nas he called the life-supporting gas, constituting 21%\nof the air and about half of everything on the earth.</p>\n<p>Where did he get this name in 1777?  The gas\nhad been isolated first by Joseph Priestley in 1774,\nwho called it “dephlogisticated air,” for such was the\nprevailing view of combustion at that time.  Priestley's\ninvestigations no doubt stimulated Lavoisier later to\ncontinue his experiments with combustion and the\ncalcining of metals.  Since to explain his 1772 results\non the increase in weight of burned sulfur, phosphorus,\nor lead, one would have to assign to phlogiston a negative\nweight (<em>sic!</em>), he saw that burning must be an absorption\nof something, and he was able to identify the\nburner as Priestley's “dephlogisticated air.”</p>\n<p>Since this substance was typically associated with\nmetallic oxides, which in turn usually produced acids\nin aqueous solution (e.g., sulfur trioxide, when dissolved\nin water, yields sulfuric acid), Lavoisier named\nthe gas <em>oxy-gène</em> (from Greek <em>oxýs</em> 'sharp, acidic').</p>\n<p>Despite his having laid the very foundations of\nmodern chemistry, Lavoisier lost his head in that\nFrench fracas before he could find that what is responsible\nfor acid formation is not oxygen, but hydrogen,\nhis water generator! (Notice, e.g., that muriatic acid is\nhydrogen chloride, HCI, with no oxygen at all.)  This\nmistake was never corrected in the names, and now\neveryone has his oxygen named for sourness:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>language</th>\n<th>word</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Turkish</td>\n<td><em>oksijen</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hebrew</td>\n<td><em>hamtsán from hómets</em> 'vinegar'</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>German</td>\n<td><em>Sauerstoff</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Russian</td>\n<td><em>kislorod</em> from <em>kislyí</em> 'sour'</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arabic</td>\n<td><em>ūksīfīn</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hungarian</td>\n<td><em>oxigén</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Japanese</td>\n<td><em>san-so</em> for 'acid-element'</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Such was the authority of Lavoisier's French, or,\neven more probably, of 19th-century German chemistry,\nwith its <em>Sauerstoff</em>, that reviving languages like\nmodern Hebrew simply took over Lavoisier's little\nslip and perpetuated the chemical confusion.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
