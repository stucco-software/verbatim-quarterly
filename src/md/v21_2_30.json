That, clearly, would have produced a date nearly a millennium earlier, for it is a quote from the New Testament (I Timothy, 6:10, KJV). I supposed that since the quote is given as “Money is the root of all evil,” the editors of the <em>Dictionary</em> were tracing back the American misquotation-as-proverb that one usually hears.</p>\n<p>When, however, I looked up Aelfric in <em>The Reader's Encyclopedia</em> (Benét) I found:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Aelfric</em>, called <em>Grammaticus</em>, or 'the Grammarian' (c. 955-c. 1020).

He might have translated it “Cupidity is ...,”“Avarice is...,” or even “The love of money is ...,” but never “Money is ...”! The Old English word for <em>cupiditas is gitsung</em> 'avarice, greed,' a word not easily confused with <em>feoh</em> 'cattle; property; money.' Having no copy of Aelfric's <em>Homilies</em> available to me, I am unable to see exactly what this cleric and grammarian wrote c. 1000, but I will lay you dollars to doughnuts (<em>low colloq</em>., ca. 1920, Partridge) that “the Grammarian” is not the source of the misquote <em>qua</em> proverb, “Money is the root of all evil.”</p>\n<p>[Roy B.
