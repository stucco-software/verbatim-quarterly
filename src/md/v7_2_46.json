When I was teaching Latin and\nthe students had to write “he led,” half the class would\nwrite “he lead.” “Lead” makes a fine sinker but not a very\ngood past tense verb.</p>\n<p>Blunders such as these are not limited to newspapers,\ntelevision and the like. Confusion can be found even in the\ngroves of academe. A professor of my acquaintance never\nknew the difference between <em>spectrum</em> and <em>specter</em>. He\nwould cheerfully “raise a spectrum” and “go through the\nabstentia.” Another once spoke of “skewered” data, in\nwhich I had to visualize the data as ready for the barbecue\ngrill.</p>\n<p>When gold first became available to the public, more\nthan one newscaster spoke of the selling of gold “bouillon.”\nGold soup doesn't sound very appetizing. A quite common\nmispronunciation is “whelp” for “welt”: “He has some big\nwhelps on his arm.”</p>\n<p>Finally, three that refuse to be classified. A certain\npolitician, in a speech here, said, “That was simply incredulous.”\nWith that statement he lost my vote. A\nnewspaper story about coin collecting caught my attention\nwith a reference to the “pneumismatic” market. And there\nwas the strange tale of the couple on vacation who returned\nhome to find their house “ramshackled.”</p>\n<h1></h1>",
