<p>We have a new Chambers over here.  No, not chamber pot,
dope; the dictionary.  It is one of our oldest, and most
idiosyncratic, and most endearing word-books.  The Chambers
family of Edinburgh has been a scholarly cottage industry
producing dictionaries for more than a century.  In 1868 the
Chambers family published a small etymological dictionary.  In
1898 they published an <em>English Dictionary</em>.  George Bernard
Shaw was a fan of it.  He wrote in a PS to the firm: “My
<em>Chambers Dictionary</em> (my favourite of half a dozen) is dated
1898.  Is there a later editionâunspoiled?”  We cannot take this
commendation entirely on its face value: he was possibly
hoping for a free copy.</p>
<p>The first edition of <em>Chambers</em> was published in 1901 and
the next two in 1952 and 1972, with a supplement in 1977.
This year we have the new edition, which makes it a red-letter
year for us wordsmiths and logophiles.  The firm is still run from
Thistle Street, Edinburgh, by Tony Chambers, great-great-grandson
of one of the founding fathers.  The dictionary is
edited by Betty Kirkpatrick, a sharp, witty Edinburgh woman,
with an editorial staff of six, concentrated on the company's
reference books.</p>
<p>The new edition has two and a quarter million words, of
which ten per cent are new material.  The opposition to
<em>Chambers</em> over here in the medium, single-volume dictionaries
are principally the <em>Concise Oxford, Collins</em>, and the <em>Longman
New Universal Dictionary</em>.  So let us ask ourselves what is
special about <em>Chambers</em>.  For one thing, its Scottish bias.  You
are more likely to find an obscure Scottish dialect word in
<em>Chambers</em> than in the others.  For another, its habit of grouping
words in clumps derived from the same source, so that, <em>par
exemple, Theosophical Society</em> comes before <em>Theocritean</em>,
because it is grouped with words derived from <em>theo</em>-.  When
looking for a word in a hurry, I have been known to curse this
habit.</p>
<p>That is a minor carp or quibble.  <em>Chambers</em> is much
favoured by our native crossword compilers and is the official
reference dictionary for the National Scrabble Championships:
do you still play Scrabble over there?  <em>Chambers</em> is good on
obscure words.  Only the other day I found in it <em>theriac</em>,
meaning an old-fashioned antidote to venomous bites, which I
deduced must exist for <em>The Times</em> jumbo crossword.  <em>Oxford
Concise</em> has it; but not <em>Collins</em> or <em>Longman's</em>.  Characteristically,
<em>Araceous</em>, which I also needed for the crossword (some
rubbish about “lords and ladies in a race round America”), was
in Chambers, but listed under <em>Arum</em>.</p>
<p>By definition, because it is the latest dictionary, the new
<em>Chambers</em> gets first crack at a number of new words in
BritEnglish; for example, <em>ra-ra skirt, multilateralist, total
allergy syndrome, kidology</em>, and <em>yomp</em>, the verb meaning to
march across country with bag and baggage, as the British
paras and other infantry did so devastatingly in the Falklands.
<em>Chambers</em> suggests that to <em>yomp</em> is in its derivation imitative,
alias onomatopoeic.  I thought that there was a possibility that it
was derived from a skiing term for slogging across flat snow in
one of the Scandinavian languages.  (British troops, particularly
paras, frequently train in Norway.)  I must look into the matter.</p>
<p>Another endearing characteristic of <em>Chambers</em> is its taste
for whimsical, not to say humorous, definitions, which suits its
connection with crosswords.  For example, we have <em>picture-restorer</em>:
“one who cleans and restores and sometimes ruins old
pictures”; <em>Pict:</em> “one of an ancient people of obscure affinities,
in Britain, esp. north-eastern Scotland; in Scottish folklore, one
of a dwarfish race of underground dwellers, to whom (with the
Romans, the Druids and Cromwell) ancient monuments are
generally attributed”; <em>perpetrate</em>: “to execute or commit (esp.
an offence, a poem, or a pun)”; and <em>eclair</em>: “...long in shape
but short in duration.”  New in this edition is the definition of
<em>man-eater</em>: “a woman given to chasing, catching and devouring
men.”</p>
<p>Alas and dammit, <em>Chambers</em> has dropped the last three
words of its definition of <em>ghost-word</em>: “a word that has
originated in the blunder of a scribe or printerâcommon in
dictionaries.”  Boo to that.</p>
<p>As you see, it is a good book of words.</p>
