On the basis of actual count,\nthe latter misspelling is actually preferred by <em>The New York\nTimes</em>, which, significantly enough, considers itself “the\nKeeper of the Anals” (or is that Annals?).</p>\n<p>This season's candidate for the word most often misused:\n<em>bemused</em>.  It means 'confused, befuddled; lost in thought,\npreoccupied'; it is more often misused to mean 'amused,'\nusually by journalists.</p>\n<p><em>Words of Size and Shape</em></p>\n<p>I am fond of words.  I like the pulsing, throbbing ones\nthat send a sentence bounding: <em>plummet, succubus, plunge</em>,\nor the angular ones that tear their way through—<em>shock,\nstark, acrylic, act</em>.  Although not enthusiastic about the thin\nwords that set the teeth on edge—<em>needle, skewer, shrew</em>—\nnor the chameleons that change their color to hide their\nmeaning: <em>appears, figuratively, alleged</em>, I truly admire the\nbig, full-blooded ones that stand like a bulwark, making the\nverbs work like hell to overcome them: <em>dungeon, mawk,\nholocaust, turgid, gothic</em>.  There are light words that float\ntheir message—<em>pastoral, serene, languid</em>, and there are the\ncossacks that thunder through the mind: <em>savage, murder,\ncauldron</em>.  I like the crisp words, too, those that make thoughts\ndance: <em>crystal, dazzle, crackle</em>.  Still, I am aware of the tyranny\nof pure definition as it strips some words of their inherent,\nalmost restful euphony—<em>gangrene, influenza</em>.  Some there\nare that have a way of grouping themselves into an invitation\nto join them in a journey—<em>down across the ways</em>, or summon\nme to view an exciting panorama of space and time: <em>dawning\nof an age, a field of stars</em>, or that give me a trip along landscapes\nof nostalgia: <em>twilight of an era, corridors of time</em>.  Yes,\nsir.  I like words.  Each is a nucleus upon which misty thoughts—\nconcepts—can condense to become vivid with life and color.\nAnd I am most fortunate for I have thirty-five thousand of\nthem immediately at hand, and quick access to a quarter\nmillion more.  Yes, indeed.  I like words. [<em>John P. Kidner, Alexandria, Virginia</em>].</p>\n<h2></h2>",
