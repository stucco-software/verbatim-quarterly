It must\nbe terrible to spend one's life observing something that one\ncan never really change.  You must grind your teeth into dust\nas you fight back your desire to tinker with the language, to\nwrite the dictionary the way it SHOULD be written.</p>\n<p>And what do you get for all of your hard work?  The hatred of\nthe masses.  And now they're out to get you.  The hoi polloi is\nworking in concert, consciously using the words “like” and\n“you know” just to drive you crazy.  Then there are those\nscummy cretins who insist upon expressing their opinions, full\nin the knowledge that they are of no value!  The very super-subtlety\nof those subservient idiots must rankle terribly when\nthey call you “sir” as they serve you a “meal” ('Death to the\nunwashed bastards!'), although I must admit that I myself\nonce thought that a square meal was the only type a linguist\never ate.</p>\n<p>I totally agree with you about the state of today's education,\nand I applaud you for abandoning the subject for the\ntime being (except for those two rather long paragraphs),\nalthough I believe that you are on the right track.  Not only\nshould we base all schooling entirely upon IQ tests to ensure\nthat those less qualified students are immediately farmed out\nto their future roles as prostitutes and con artists, but we\nshould also encourage the development of these and other\nskills, if for no other reason than to obviate the possibility of\nbeing labeled elitists or somesuch.</p>\n<p>Poor Kay Haugaard has a similar, equally serious case of\nthe same malady.  As one who evidentally has been a close\npersonal friend of nearly everybody of any importance at all\nsince day one, she must be dying a death of a thousand cuts as\nshe watches the deterioration of our fine, logical language.</p>\n<p>Likewise, J. Walter Wilson is to be congratulated for\nsharing his absolute knowledge of the <em>true</em> meaning of “off\nagain, on again,” as Clyde K. Hyder should receive accolades\nfor living long enough to tell us exactly how Peter schemed to\nget his name into common usage many years after his death.</p>\n<p>All in all, it seems to me that the lot of you, the contentrigid,\nimpotent, mewling “guardians of our culture” should\ntake off your blinders and get out of your towers in order to\nbetter understand what in the world is going on.</p>\n<p>As a high school drop-out, I know that I am less than\nperfect.  Even so, you will not soon catch me constructing a\nsentence like “...it is Peter <em>that</em> Christ addresses....”\n(“Etymologica Obscura,” page eleven, third paragraph).</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>VERBATIM: Would you like another issue?</p>\n<p>I: (<em>Shaking head</em>) I'm fine, thanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Greg Raven, Los Angeles, California].</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
