That is scarcely a profound observation, for every\nexpression must have its origins somewhere, its originator must\nbe a speaker of the language, and every speaker of every\nlanguage speaks a dialect of some sort.  In America, because of\nthe universality of radio, television, and national periodicals\nand—to some extent at least—of the <em>Völkerwanderung</em> of the\nyears since the early 1940s, the relatively firm isoglosses, or\nboundaries between conterminous dialect areas have been\nbreached.

It is not impossible that\nMr. Rather's popularity stems to some degree from his speaking\nin a dialect similar to that affected by popular singers, almost\nall of whom imitate, with varying success, the folksy country\naccents of the United States.

Similes are rife:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[As pretty as] ... a speckled puppy under a red wagon.</p>\n<p>[As confused as] ... a rubber-nosed woodpecker in the\nPetrified Forest.</p>\n<p>[As tearful as] ... a child that's lost his chewing gum\non a henhouse floor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The foregoing illustrate style rather than lexical regionalisms.\nBut the latter occur in profusion, too:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>pirootin': Messing around; from “pirouetting.”</p>\n<p>tickler: A flat pocket flask.</p>\n<p>favorance: Resemblance.</p>\n<p>gumshot: Slingshot.</p>\n<p>throddy: Well rounded; plump; chuffy.</p>\n<p>in the room of: In place of.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... and many more.</p>\n<p>Although Wilder has included some words and expressions\nthat, doubtlessly, occur in the speech of the area he describes, I\nhave my reservations about accepting them as exclusively\nindigenous or, indeed, as having originated there.  Such terms as\n<em>tacky</em> 'not couth,' <em>farthingale</em> 'hooped petticoat,' <em>smidgen, on\ntick, in a pig's eye, hog wild, traipse, jitney, gallimaufry,\ntailormades</em>, and <em>What boots it</em>?, for which a citation from\nMilton's <em>Lycidas</em> is provided, can scarcely be said to occur\nexclusively in the dialect(s) he describes.  Also, it is a shame that\nWilder credits Robert Burchfield and not, more properly, Allen\nWalker Read with the etymology of <em>O.K.</em>  [p. 173].</p>\n<p>Most books of this kind are quite thin and are generally\npadded out by (large) illustrations.  <em>You All Spoken Here</em>, a hefty\n215 pages (plus a foreword by the redoubtable Willard R.\nEspy), is packed with entries and information.  My only\ncriticism is that its broad, topical organization affords little\nopportunity for reference, as the material is not readily retrievable\nand, alas, there is no index.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
