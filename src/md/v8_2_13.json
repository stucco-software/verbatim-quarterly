Certainly, it is the most comprehensive\ndictionary ever published in America, and those fortunate\nenough to own a well-reserved set of this massive,\nten-volume book can attest to the incomparable quality\nof its definitions, citations, and illustrations; the number\nof sets surviving in good condition are a tribute to the\ncraft of bookmaking—the heavy durable boards, sturdy\nbinding, high-quality paper, and other ingredients that\nhave allowed the <em>Century</em> to withstand almost a century\nof use.</p>\n<p>The first edition was published in 1889, and supplementary\nmatter was added till the last printing in 1911.\nAlso, two supplementary volumes were produced, a\n<em>Cyclopedia of Names</em> (in 1894) and an <em>Atlas and Gazetteer</em>\n(in 1897).  With these additions, the title of the\nentire work was changed to <em>The Century Dictionary\nand Cyclopedia.</em></p>\n<p>It is with special pride that we are able to present to\nthe readers of VERBATIM advance notice of the\nreprinting of this important dictionary: Gale Research\nCompany, of Detroit, will publish a facsimile reprint of\nthe entire work (exclusive of the <em>Atlas and Gazetteer)</em> in\n1982.  Robert A.  Fowkes, Professor Emeritus of Germanic\nLanguages, New York University, has prepared a\nPreface for the reprint, and we are pleased to have\nobtained permission from the publisher to print it in this\nissue of VERBATIM.  Professor Fowkes's name is, of\ncourse, familiar to our readers.  But it should be made\nclear that our reason for publishing his Preface here is\nthat it is, in itself, an important statement about the\nEnglish language, for it details information that is often\noverlooked and only rarely documented.</p>\n<p>It must be emphasized that the <em>Century</em> will not be\noffered as a relic (in the way that a reprint of Johnson's\n<em>Dictionary</em> might): it is a vast, useful resource, providing\naccess to information about English that is difficult\nto find in most other sources.  To be sure, it has its\nshortcomings—Professor Fowkes points out the faults in\nthe pronunciation system and the fact that, lacking the\ndata that has since become available, some of its etymologies\ncould scarcely be said to reflect the latest in\nscholarship.  Furthermore, users will not find terms like\n<em>transistor, gridlock</em>, and <em>electronic banking</em> in its pages,\nbecause they did not exist at the turn of the century.\nNonetheless, the <em>Century's</em> definitions are a model of\nclarity and, as Professor Fowkes points out, its citations\nwere adduced to illustrate a particular context, syntactic\nrelationship, or nuance of meaning lacking in the selection\nof citations for a work like the <em>Oxford English\nDictionary</em>, which, being a dictionary based on historical\nprinciples, was largely satisfied to find the earliest\ninstances of word uses assignable to a particular meaning.\nProfessor Fowkes comments on the differences and\nsimilarities between the <em>Century</em> and the <em>OED</em>, but\nreaders should take heed of an essential distinction\nbetween the two works: the <em>Century</em> was conceived and\nexecuted as a reference book for everyone to use; the\n<em>OED</em>, both in concept and execution, is a reference book\nfor scholars of the English language, and it consequently\ncontains huge quantities of information—especially\netymological information—of little use to those\nunable to bring to the book a working knowledge of Old\nand Middle English, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Arabic, and\nthe other languages reproduced in their original forms\nin its etymologies.</p>\n<p>As for their comparable ages, during the period of\npublication of the <em>Century,</em> 1889-1911, letters A through\nR of the <em>OED</em> were published, with parts of S and T.\nThus, almost 89 per cent of the <em>OED</em> is older than the\nlast editions of the <em>Century.</em>  To be sure, the <em>OED\nSupplement</em> of 1935 provided up-to-date materials for\nthe earlier parts of the alphabet, but not a great deal for\nthe latter parts.  The current <em>Supplement,</em> now available\nin two volumes (A-G and H-N), effectively brings the\nearlier parts more up to date than did the earlier\n<em>Supplement</em>, which it includes.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, the <em>Century Dictionary and\nCyclopedia</em> is a monumental work of lexicography, and\nwe can all be grateful to Gale Research Company for\nmaking the reprint available.</p>\n<p>For those segments of the language that have not\nchanged, the <em>Century</em> remains an accurate, well-written,\nand easy-to-use dictionary for the modern reader.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
