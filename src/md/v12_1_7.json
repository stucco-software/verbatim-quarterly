There are other odd twists\nin the variations of names of “saint places,” but these will\nsuffice.</p>\n<p>There is no village “Pétrocor,” but Périgueux, an important\ntown of the Dordogne, is the home of some 170,000\n<em>Pétrocoriens</em> and <em>Pétrocoriennes</em>.  The <em>Agathois</em> hail from\nAgde, and the <em>Trécorrois</em> are the citizens of Tréguier.  The\nvillage of étables-sur-Mer (literally 'stables on the sea'), a\nmodest place of perhaps 3,000 inhabitants, gives its folks the\nslightly Slavic-sounding label <em>Tagarins</em>.  Or take Elne, near\nPerpignan.  The logical people of Perpignan call themselves\n<em>Perpignanais</em>.  However, their neighbors at Elne, about a\ntwentieth the size of Perpignan, are nothing less than\n<em>Illibériens</em>.  The denizens of Gévaudan, a region formerly\nterrorized by an alleged man-eating wolf, call themselves\n<em>Gabalitains</em>.  Pont-l'Abbé, where they make a lot of jam, has\nmale inhabitants unsurprisingly referred to as <em>Pontl'Abbistes</em>.\nBut, because of the fancy headdresses the ladies\nof that charming Breton community wear, the feminine\nform is <em>Bigoudens</em>!</p>\n<p>There are many places in France named Villefranche—\n'free city'—most likely stemming from early times.  One cannot\nhelp wondering how the people of Villefranche-sur-Saône\n(on the River Saône) came to be known as <em>Caladois</em>.</p>\n<p>Neung-sur-Beuvron lies in the chateau country.  The village\nname itself is a bit odd; the inhabitants go by\n<em>Nugdunois</em>.  The people of Moyenmoutier, a village of the\nVosges, apparently traded what would have been a 14-letter\nname, <em>Moyenmoutiens</em>, for a 19-letter jawbreaker:\n<em>Médianimonastériens</em>.  At least there was logic here, for both\n<em>moutier</em> and <em>monastère</em> mean 'monastery,' and both <em>median</em>\nand <em>moyen</em> convey 'middle.'  The celebrated French writer\nFrancis de la Rochefoucauld, if he came from the village of\nthe same name, was a <em>Rupificaldien</em>.</p>\n<p>Latin origins account for some of the seemingly freakish\nwords.  Also, in all probability, some go back to traditions\nand legends now lost in the mists of years or at least beyond\nthe layman's ability to track them down.  But isn't it things\nlike these that add spice to language—and life?  Let us hope,\nthen, that all the divers human tongues with all their peculiarities,\nwill persist, Esperanto and other synthetic languages\nnotwithstanding.</p>",
