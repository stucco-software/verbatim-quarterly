There\nare, indeed, many words invented from pseudo-English\nwith the suffix -<em>man</em> (e.g., <em>barman</em> 'bartender';\nrecordman 'record-holder'; and dozens of others),\nbut I don't believe that Mr. Webb's two examples\nare among them.  On the other hand, the common\nterms <em>morphinomane</em> and <em>toxicomane</em> (note spellings)\nnot only “merit official use” but have been in\nthe language for quite some time (ca 1900 and 1920\nrespectively), as have numerous other nouns—e.g.\n<em>mégalomane, cocaïnomane, héroïnomane, éthéromane,</em>\netc.—ending in the similarly pronounced\nbut very different Greek-rooted suffix -<em>mane</em>.  (<em>Belle\nEpoque</em> specialists will recall the celebrated night-club-performer-cum-anatomical-wonder Le\nPétomane, much admired for his ability—<em>mirabile\nrectu!</em>—to fart [<em>péter</em>] in near-perfect tune, unto every\nsharp and flat(ulence), and with great brio, and\nwhose rendition of <em>La Marseillaise</em> is said to have\nbeen particularly memorable.)  For that matter, the\nword <em>junkie</em> itself was even adopted into the French\n“in” slang of the eighties—<em>le français branché</em>—\nalong with the less common <em>addict</em>, more often reserved\nfor figurative use.

Note, for example,\nsuch slang forms as <em>bédé</em> (from <em>BD, bande\ndessinée</em> '[sophisticated] comic strip'); <em>elpé</em> (from <em>LP</em>,\ni.e., 'long-playing record'); and <em>jité</em> (from <em>JT, journal\ntélévisé</em> 'television news broadcast').  Along the same\nlines, though somewhat more involved, is the word\n<em>pécu</em> 'toilet paper' (from <em>PQ</em>, itself a punnish abbreviation\nof <em>papier cul</em>), which has also come to mean a\npompous piece of writing, with the corresponding\nverb <em>pécufier</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[Norman R.
