<p>For those who cannot afford the <em>OED</em> and find the
etymologies given in college and unabridged dictionaries inadequate,
the <em>ODEE</em> is an ideal companion.  The etymologies
provided are not, of course, as full or as thorough as those that
can be found in larger works, but they are probably adequate
for most use beyond the casual.  Cognates and reflexes in other
languages are provided, as well as the century in which the
earliest evidence places them.  About 24,000 basic etymologies
are listed; with derivatives, more than 38,000 forms are treated.
Entries are succinct and contain glosses for the various stages
of semantic change undergone by the word.  To pick a typical,
well-known example of this genre, here is the entry for <em>nice</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>nice</em> nais †foolish, stupid XIII; †wanton XIV;
†coy, shy XV; fastidious, dainty; difficult to
manage or decide; minute and subtle; precise,
critical; minutely accurate XVI; dainty,
appetizing; agreeable, delightful XVIII. -
OF.  <em>nice</em> silly, simple = Pr. <em>nesci</em>, Sp. <em>necio</em>,
It. <em>nescio</em> :- L. <em>nesciu-s</em> ignorant, f. <em>ne</em>- NE +
<em>sci</em>-, <em>scīre</em> know (see SCIENCE).  So <em>nice</em>TY
nai.s\?\ti.  XIV. - OF. <em>niceté</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As can been seen, various obvious symbols are used to indicate
obsoleteness (†), and dated matter (small capital Roman numerals);
other, less self-evident symbols (:â which signifies 'normal
development';â 'adoption of', etc.) are clearly set forth in the
front matter.</p>
<p>The only shortcoming of the <em>ODEE</em> is its pronunciation
system, which repeats, in part, the curious system used in the
<em>OED</em>.  Moreover, the key is of little help for it contains
examples like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\?\ <em>moral</em> (m\?\r\?\l), <em>priority</em> (prai\?\r\?\ti).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you say the first vowel in <em>moral</em> to rhyme with that in <em>shot</em>
or in <em>short</em>?  The clue comes in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\?\ <em>oft</em> (\?\ft), <em>broth</em> (br\?\p),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose.  But why give <em>boreen</em> and <em>cocotte</em>, which can scarcely
be said to be everyday words, as the key words for the
pronunciation of the symbol o?  Other sample words listed in
the “Key to the Pronunciation” (ix) are <em>Marathi, loofah, borax,
gatling, discrepant, bodega, opulent, endue, and frustrum</em>ânot
exactly words you find around the house.  It comes as some
consolation that the <em>ODEE</em> is a dictionary of etymology, not of
pronunciation.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this criticism, the <em>ODEE</em> is a serviceable,
workaday reference that offers much useful and interesting
information in usable form.</p>
