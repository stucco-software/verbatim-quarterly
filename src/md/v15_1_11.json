Among the signatories are...\nIris Murdoch, William Golding, Anthony Powell, Ted\nHughes, Roy Fuller, Kingsley Amis, Anita Brookner,\nMalcolm Muggeridge, Brigid Brophy, Sir John\nGielgud, Sir Michael Hordern, Auberon Waugh and\nLord Scarman.”  This was accompanied by the (usual)\nlamentations over the “murder of a fine language,” the\ngenerally poor standard of English encountered in the\nnewspapers and on radio and TV, and the observation\nthat “children cannot spell or use the right tenses.”  All\nthis activity is being carried on by the Queen's English\nSociety, characterized by <em>The Times</em> as “a pressure\ngroup with fewer than 300 members.”  On October\n29th, a BBC Radio Scotland program was running a\ncompetition in which people calling in were asked to\nspell <em>ventriloquist</em> and <em>kibbutz</em> (among other words,\npresumably); several callers with “older” voices—they\ncertainly were not children—were unable to do so;\ndoes that mean that the Scots are to be excepted from\nthe QES campaign “to compel all children to study\nformal grammar up to the age of 16” or that the rot set\nin long ago?

Letters in support or condemnation\nof the QES program (though one may assume\nthey will insist on <em>programme</em>) should be addressed to\nMrs Anne Shelley, Secretary, Queen's English Society, 3\nManor Crescent, Guildford GU2 6NF, England.
