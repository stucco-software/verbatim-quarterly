It is wrong to think that British speakers never say <em>truck</em> for <em>lorry, escalator</em> for <em>moving stairway</em>, and so forth. Not only do they know the words and phrases, to which they have been exposed through travel, tourists, movies, television, reading, and ordinary commerce—the properly descriptive word, <em>intercourse</em>, comes to mind only to be suppressed—but they use them, sometimes as free variants, sometimes with specialized meanings: there are some who might say that a <em>truck</em> is different from a <em>lorry</em>, but practice varies. In some instances, the British enjoy twitting Americans about some of their taboos. Certainly one of the—dare I say?—prominent examples is <em>cock</em>, which means both 'male bird' and 'penis' in both dialects; the “situation” arises because it meant 'male bird' more commonly in British English and 'penis' more commonly in American English, a fairly clear case of distribution. This gave rise to what Brits, who evidently had little to laugh at, thought was hilarious: <em>roostertail</em> for <em>cocktail</em>. One notes today, though, that American prudery might have had some effect in Britain, where one now encounters <em>cockerel</em> as often as <em>cock</em> in direct reference to 'male bird.' While at one time the sense of 'penis' was relatively far down the awareness scale of those who had occasion to refer to <em>cocks</em> (as 'male birds'), its sense of 'penis' has increased in frequency and awareness level in recent years. Proof of this can be seen in a recent “Diary” article by Ruth Dudley Edwards [<em>The Independent</em>, 23 January 1995, p. 13] in which she quotes, with “inexpressible joy,” the following passage from Angela Thirkell's <em>The Brandons</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Grant, really quite glad of an excuse to dismount, offered his cock to Lydia, who immediately flung a leg over it, explaining that she had put on a frock with pleats on purpose, as she always felt sick if she rode sideways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>",
