For those VERBATIM\nreaders who remember their Latin, I add it parenthetically.</p>\n<p>In Plautus' <em>The Little Carthaginian</em> (vv.\n360–63), a swain thus wheedles his girl: “My pleasure, my delight, my life, my pleasantness, my kiss,\nmy honey, my colostrum, my softest little cheese.”</p>\n<p>Another Plautine comedy, <em>Donkey Girl</em> (vv.\n693-94), features this tart's address to a slave:\n“Duckling, dove or puppy, swallow, jackdaw, tiny\nlittle sparrow.”</p>\n<p>Suetonius ( <em>Life of Caligula,</em> ch. 13) says the\nbesotted populace hailed him as “Star, chick, babe,\nnursling.”</p>\n<p>The poets Martial ( <em>Epigrams,</em> bk. 10 no. 68)\nand Juvenal ( <em>Satire</em> 6 vv. 191–96) rebuke women for\nusing Greek love-talk, especially <em>Zoe kai Psyche</em>\n('My Life and Soul'), “words fit only for under the\nblanket.” They were, though—mocks the philosopher-bard Lucretius ( <em>On the Nature of Things,</em> bk. 4 vv.\n1160–69)—useful to the man as euphemisms for\nhis lady's physical defects. This verbal technique is\nalso recommended in a fragment of Philaenis' sex\nmanual (all ancient sex manuals were attributed to\nwomen).</p>\n<p>Dorothy Sayers, in <em>Busman's Honeymoon,</em> provides the best gloss: after the wedding night, Harriet Wimsey (née Vane) lies wondering if Lord\nPeter's first words would be in English or French.</p>\n<p>The first passage's <em>pleasantness (amoenitas),</em>\nalong with (elsewhere) <em>my commodity</em> and <em>my\nopportunity,</em> affords scope to Marxist cash-nexus\nanalyses of love. <em>Little eye</em> ( <em>ocellus</em> ) is a bit loaded—Roman graffito-mongers often drew penises with an eye in the tip. Little lip (labellum) may be a paradoxical pun on labes ('ruin,' a regular insult). Kiss\nis here savium: Catullus would later introduce basium (whence baiser, bacio, beso, etc.), poetically heaping his kisses onto Lesbia to the tune of 3,\n(Ralegh's Now Serena Be Not Coy extends them to\ninfinity)—we may agree with Shakespeare's\namorous Antony, “There's beggary in the love that\ncan be measured.” Honey ( mel —there are several\ncognate terms, plus a Pompeian wall-scribbler's\naphorism “Lovers like bees live in honey”) is the\nobvious ancestor of amatory American, albeit there\nis no Latin equivalent to “Hi, Honey, I'm Home.”</p>\n<p>Colostrum (same in Latin), unexplained and\nuntranslated by Dickie, denotes beestings, another\ncompliment with possible barb. Cheese (caseus) in\nAustralian slang (so Eric Partridge) stands for wife\n(Cockneyesque rhyming slang, cheese and kisses =\n'missus'). In view of its concomitant adjective ( molliculus) , I deduce that the Roman lover would express this cheesy compliment “con brie-o.”</p>\n<p>In the remorselessly zoöphile second address,\nduckling (anaticula) is a unique sobriquet; although\nNorthern English duck (or ducks ) and theatrical\ncamp duckie come to mind, while in eighteenth-\ncentury slang a ship's quartermaster was a duck-\nfucker. The dove (columba) had a reputation for\nlechery. As with us (cf. the poem Jackdaw of\nRheims ), jackdaws were proverbial thieves. The\nsparrow (passer) was particularly libidinous, not\nonly at Rome, Chaucer's Sumner being “as hoot\nand lecherous as a sparwe.” (I won't dilate on\nBritish sparrowfart 'dawn,' except to wonder if\nthese birds are really that flatulent and who has\nactually heard them erupt?) Some interpret\nCatullus' poem on his mistress' deceased sparrow\n(clearly Not A Well Bird) as a lament for his sexual\nimpotence, a Northern English expression for\nwhich is my bird's dead. Dorothy Parker has the\nlast word here: “That thing he wrote, the time the\nsparrow died/Oh, most unpleaant—gloomy tedious\nwords!/I called it sweet, and made believe I\ncried;/The stupid fool!—I've always hated birds!”\nOf the Caligulan compliments, chick (pullus)\nwas Roman (also old American) gay argot—cf. the\nremarkably open allusions to prison homosexuality in Elvis's <em>Jailhouse Rock</em> —while the American sense of <em>star</em> 'hardened criminal' well suits this emperor.</p>\n<p>Two final titbits, neither in Dickie. At school,\nwe learned <em>Mercimoni Lepidi!</em> 'What a smart baggage!' for its grammar, but I fancy the Romans were more concerned with the genitals than the genitives. A barmaid in Petronius' <em>Satyricon</em> is called a <em>bacciballum.</em> Nobody knows what this means.\n'round as a berry' is one etymological possibility. I\nhave seen it rendered <em>butterball,</em> not a candidate\nfor revival in this age of Calista Flockhart and other\nHollywood living skeletons. 'Pretty round thing'\nand 'absolute peach' are two other modern British\ntranslations. A French effort is <em>un superbe brin de\nfille.</em> Two Teutonic stabs are <em>ein allerliebstes\nWeibschen</em> and <em>ein putziges Schnuckelchen</em> —\nGerman is really not designed for amatory discourse. A good example, this, of the day-to-day problems that confront classical editors; as Robert\nFrost remarked, “Poetry is what gets left out of the\ntranslation.”</p>\n<p><em>[Keep a lookout for much more from Barry\nBaldwin in future issues.]</em></p>",
