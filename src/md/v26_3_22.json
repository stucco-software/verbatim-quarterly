One of these is the colorful phrase, “tall poppy,” which is found on page 1819. It is defined as: “n. Aus. jsomebody who, through achievements or wealth, has become a prominent member of society (informal).” “Tall poppy” is followed by a related phrase, “tall poppy syndrome,” whose definition reads: “public figures who loom large and the tendency by the media to want to bring them down.” Both phrases owe their origin to a passage from Roman literature. This is the <em>Ab Urbe Condita</em> <em>(From the Foundation of the City)</em> written by the historian Livy (59 B.C.-17 <em>A.D.</em>).</p>\n<p>In the fifty-third and fifty-fourth chapters of Livy's first book we learn about the actions of Sextus Tarquinius, son of Tarquinius Superbus the tyrannt-king of Rome, who betrayed Gabii, a city that had accepted Sextus disguised as a suppliant for purposes of treachery in order to advance the schemes of his father. Resorting to a plan <em>minime arte Romana fraude ac dolo</em>, “not like the Roman technique at all, one of fraud and trickery,” the elder Tarquin had sent his son out to win the confidence of the leaders of Gabii by hook or by crook. After achieving his duplicitous end, Sextus sent a messenger back to his father in Rome to find out what next the king wanted him to do. Since a verbal reply could be trusted to no one, the king led the messenger into his gardens, and there walking about in silence was reported to have struck off the heads of the tallest poppies with his walking stick, <em>ibi inambulans tacitus summa papaverum capita dicitur baculo decussisse.</em> When this curious behavior was reported to Sextus, he understood immediately that he had to eliminate the leaders of Gabii, <em>primores civitates interemit.</em> This being done, Gabii was absorbed by Tarquin's empire.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-b1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Thus we can see that these two striking phrases have come from an episode in Livy's history.
