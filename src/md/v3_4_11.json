Blue backs are Confederate bills.  Blue bellies\nare Yankee boys....</p>\n<p>Children collect nouns, bugs, bottlecaps, seashells,\nverbs: What's that?  What's it doing now?  Who's this?\nand with the greed that rushes through them like rain\ndown gulleys, they immediately grasp the prepositions\nof belonging and the pronouns of possession.  But how\noften do they ask how cold it is, what color, how loud,\nrare, warm, responsive, kind, how soft, how wet, how\nnoxious, loving, indiscreet, how sour?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The book abounds in four-letter words (besides <em>blue</em>).\nIt is a sensuous, erotic book that seems to say “Color me\nblue.”  It ranges from Democritus to Demosthenes to Henri\nBergson to Henry Miller to Henry James.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...while there is time and you are able, because\nwhen blue has left the edges of its objects as if the\nworld were bleached of it, when the wide blue eye\nhas shut down for the season, when there's nothing\nleft but language....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>",
