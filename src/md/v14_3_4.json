Gold</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Haifa, Israel</span></em></p>\n<p>November 1985 saw the beginning of a controversy\nover whether a poem which Gary Taylor and\nStanley Wells attributed to William Shakespeare was\nreally by the Bard of Avon (see, for example, the front\npage of <em>The New York Times</em> of November 24, 1985,\nthe editorial page of <em>The New York Times</em> of December\n8, 1985, and <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> of\nDecember 15, 1985).  Both sides tried to buttress their\narguments by quoting from the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>\n[<em>OED</em>] and at least one side misunderstood the\nfunction of this dictionary.  In a letter to the editor of\nthe <em>Times</em>, published in the December 8, 1985 issue\n(p. 26 E), John J. Soldo, who identified himself as the\nauthor of <em>The Tempering of T. S. Eliot</em> and three\nbooks of poetry, wrote, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The dating, given [by Taylor] as 1593-1595—\nprimarily because of echoes in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>—cannot\nbe any earlier than 1591, when, according\nto the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, the\nuse of <em>die</em> to mean “pining away for denied passion”\ncame into the language.  That is a year before\nShakespeare is assumed to have arrived in\nLondon at the age of 28, a period in which his\nearliest comedies and histories display undigested\nliterary dross.  [Quoted verbatim except for slight\ntypographical changes.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The earliest citation for this sense of <em>die</em> in the\n<em>OED</em> is indeed from 1591; the <em>Supplement</em> adds no\ncitations.  This, however, does not mean that the compilers\nof the <em>OED</em> were suggesting that the sense in\nquestion arose in that year or that anyone is entitled to\ninfer as much.  All we can say is that the <em>OED's</em> readers\nfound no earlier citations.  That is because: (1) the\nsense indeed arose in that year; or (2) it arose earlier\nbut was not used in writing until that year; or (3) it\nwas used in writing earlier than 1591 but these written\nsources were not extant at the time the <em>OED</em> was being\ncompiled; or (4) it was used in writing earlier than\n1591 but these written sources were missed by the\n<em>OED's</em> readers.  Indeed, written works do not usually\ncontain the first instance of a usage and all that most\nof the citations in the <em>OED</em> and other dictionaries\nallow us to establish is a <em>terminus a quo</em>, that is, a time\nat which we may be certain the usage already existed.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if the author of the poem used <em>die</em> in\nthis sense and Taylor and Wells date the poem to\n1593-95, this three-year period is after the <em>terminus a\nquo</em> for the sense, hence its appearance in the poem is\nin no way unusual.  However, even if the <em>OED</em> had no\ncitations for this sense of <em>die</em> from before 1596 (a hypothetical\ncase!), the dating to 1593-95 could still stand.\nIn such a case, the poem, if the dating is correct,\nwould be evidence that <em>die</em> in this sense was used earlier\nthan our hypothetical 1596 earliest citation in the\n<em>OED</em> (the poem would thus constitute an antedating).\nIf so, we would be unable to tell whether this sense\nwas first used in the poem since it could have been used\nearlier (elsewhere) but was missed by the <em>OED's</em> compilers\n(and others) for reasons (2) or (3) above.  <em>Die</em> in\nthis sense is thus not relevant one way or the other to\nthe dating or attribution of this poem.</p>\n<p>Soldo goes further.  If I interpret correctly his remarks\nabout Shakespeare's “literary adolescence” and\ndisplay of “undigested literary dross,” Soldo is saying\nthat in 1593-95 (and certainly earlier if anyone wants\nto date the poem before that time) Shakespeare was\nsuch a hack that he could not possibly have used <em>die</em> in\nwhat was then a freshly minted sense.  As shown above,\nhowever, we do not really know when this sense arose:\nit could have been in 1591 or earlier.  If earlier, it could\nhave become quite common by the first half of the\n1590s.  Also, there is nothing to prevent even a hack\nfrom innovating once in a while or using a still unhackneyed\nform.  It does not seem, therefore, that <em>die</em>\nin this sense is relevant in any way to the date or\nauthorship of the poem.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
