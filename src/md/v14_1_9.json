Spears, (The Scarecrow Press, 1986), xv + 585pp.</p>\n<p>[A VERBATIM Book Club Selection]</p>\n<p>Anyone even vaguely familiar with slang and jargon\nand with the seemingly bottomless source they\ndraw on in the language of drugs and drink will shudder\nto consider how formidable a task Spears set for\nhimself in compiling this work.  I read recently—though\nit merely confirmed a deep-seated conviction of mine—\nthat there are more synonyms for <em>drunk</em> than for any\nother word in the language.  I haven't bothered to count\nthem exactly, but I found about 125 (listed as standard,\n<em>Informal</em>, and <em>Slang</em>, in separate paragraphs) for the\nadjective alone, and listed in <em>The Synonym Finder</em>\n(Rodale, 1978).  Spears's list goes on for almost <em>eight\npages</em>! Moreover, <em>The Synonym Finder</em> count includes\nphrases like <em>drunk as a</em>—, while Spears carries on with\nanother two pages of entries.  The only other entry that\nlists such a profusion of terms is that for <em>dope</em> 'any\ndrug, narcotic, opiate, or chemical which produces\nsedation, euphoria, stimulation, analgesia or stupor.'\nThat, too, goes on for eight pages.  The <em>dope</em> list is\nextremely interesting in that it reflects the linguistic\nresourcefulness of those associated with a subculture\nthat is scarcely connected in most people's minds with\nlexicographic or metaphoric or poetic inventiveness.  (A\npublisher's blurb reports that <em>SJDD</em> lists “167 terms for\npowdered cocaine, 151 for P.C.P. (angel dust), and 624\nterms for marijuana.”</p>\n<p>This is a subject about which I am pitifully naive:\nindeed, the material, with its documentation, is so\noverwhelming that I should be surprised to discover\nthat our friendly neighborhood drug peddler knows a\nlarge percentage of the terms.  My eye was caught by a\nnumber of compound terms that included <em>Owsley</em>,\nunder the entry of <em>L.S.D.</em>, and a look at the entry for\n<em>Owsley</em> revealed that Augustus Owsley Stanley III was\nthe name of one of the early makers of L.S.D. (Timothy\nLeary does not appear to have been memorialized in\nthe culture he did so much to publicize.)</p>\n<p>I assume that <em>crack</em> arrived in the language too\nlate for inclusion: from the compilation in the <em>SJDD</em> I\ncan only assume that the term is actually as new as it is\nreported to be, for Spears adduces evidence from 283\nsources (some representing a number of informants)\nand, had <em>crack</em> been around earlier, he would surely\nhave found it.  I cannot offer comment on a great\nnumber of entries.  I am not quite sure that I understand\nwhy, under <em>mother's milk</em> (also <em>mother's ruin</em>)\n'gin; any liquor' we find “Heard on the M<em>A</em>S*H television\nprogram (1970s)” but no reference to Shaw's\n<em>Pygmalion</em>.  Other sources date the term back to 1821,\nbut I am reasonably sure there is a reference to\n<em>mother's ruin</em> in one (or more) of the series of engravings\nby William Hogarth, which would antedate 1821\nby a century.</p>\n<p>Even if one were to analyze the terms from the\nstandpoint of word play, the <em>SJDD</em> would prove an\ninvaluable source, with its thorough documentation of\nits subject: every single entry is cross-keyed to the\nsource(s) where it was found.  The definitions are terse,\nto the point, and, where necessary, explanatory.  For\ninstance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>mosquitoes</em> cocaine.  This may refer to marks\nleft by hypodermic injections rather than the\ndrug itself...</p>\n<p><em>Oz man</em> a drug seller or distributor... See\n<em>ounce man</em>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This last item, which, without the reference, I should\nhave thought had come from a reference to L. Frank\nBaum's novels, obviously comes from the abbreviation\nfor <em>ounce</em>.</p>\n<p>Space does not permit a more detailed description\nof this impressive work, which is a pity, for it is patently\none of the best specialized dictionaries to have\ncome my way in any field.</p>\n<p>The only sour note, which I cannot restrain, concerns\nthe typography, which is simply awful.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
