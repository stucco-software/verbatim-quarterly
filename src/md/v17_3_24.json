Below\nis [a selection from] the list of words in your article,\naccompanied by a number code; as will be seen, the\nwords in each group have very similar codes.  My\nelaboration of Soundex works according to the following\nrules: [<em>Target</em> means 'the item to be coded.']</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(a) Change each <em>d</em> or <em>t</em> in the target to <em>c</em>.</p>\n<p>(b) Change each <em>ng</em> cluster to <em>m</em>.</p>\n<p>(c) If the target begins with <em>kn</em>, replace <em>kn</em>\nwith <em>m</em>.</p>\n<p>(d) If the target begins with <em>h, y</em>, or a vowel,\ndrop it and follow these rules.</p>\n<p>(e) If the target begins with <em>r</em> or <em>w</em>, replace it\nwith an <em>l</em>.</p>\n<p>(f) Code the target according to Soundex rules.</p>\n<p>(g) Replace the initial letter of the Soundex\ncode with the appropriate numerical code\nfrom the Soundex code table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, for example, the target <em>halogenating</em> would go\nthrough the following changes while being coded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>halogenating   (target)<br>\nhalogenacing   (rule a)<br>\nhalogenacim    (rule b)<br>\nalogencim      (rule d)<br>\nlogenacim      (rule d, again)<br>\nL252           (rule f)<br>\n4252           (rule g)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because the system is completely based on rules\nand ignores meanings, any word can be added to the\nspelling checker's word list.</p>\n<p>In Minnesota and Illinois, the first four characters\nof a person's driver's license number are the\nSoundex code of his surname.  Not long into the\nmovie <em>The Blues Brothers</em>, Elwood Blues Illinois\ndriver's license is shown on a police computer\nscreen.  It is obviously a phony, for it should begin\nwith the code B420, but does not.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>nucleic     5242<br>\nreawakens   4252<br>\nnutlike     5242<br>\nwakens      4252<br>\nknuckled    5242<br>\nrattans     4252<br>\nnickeled    5242<br>\nweakens     4252<br>\nnucleate    5242<br>\nreddens     4252<br>\nneglect     5242<br>\nweaklings   4245<br>\nnutlet      5242<br>\nwalk-ons    4425<br>\nniggled     5242<br>\nwalk-ins    4425<br>\nBordeaux    1622<br>\nparadox     1622<br>\nunmanageable 5521<br>\nburdocks    1622<br>\nmanageable   5521<br>\nbroadax     1622<br>\nmanageably   5521<br>\nbirdseed    1622<br>\ninimitable   5521<br>\nbirdhouse   1622<br>\namendable    5521<br>\nbordellos   1624<br>\nunimaginable 5525<br>\nbureaux     1624</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Raymond S.
