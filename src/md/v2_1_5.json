No Vermont governor has been willing to intervene.</p>\n<p>The “most unkindest cut of all” came when a mountain\nabove the Winooski River, called <em>Camel's Hump</em>, had\nits name adopted for a new middle school.  Architects and\nschool officials (not teachers) did their “research” and\nplaced on the outside wall in huge lettering “CAMELS\nHUMP MIDDLE SCHOOL.”  Future generations of\nyoung scholars will pass under that nonapostrophic label\nevery morning for years until they pass on to the high\nschool, where their English teachers will have to work to\nundo years of subconscious training in bad spelling.</p>\n<p>Nor is Vermont the only state to suffer.  Down in\nMencken's “Free State” of Maryland, you can find <em>St.\nMary's City, St. Mary's River, St. Mary's County</em>, and <em>St.\nMary's College</em> on federal maps, all lacking their proper\napostrophes.  However, residents include them on their stationery,\nthe county commissioners use them officially, and\nthe English Department of the college still teaches the use\nof apostrophes with proper names, in spite of the bureaucrats\nupriver.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
