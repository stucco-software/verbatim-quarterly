Happily,\nhistory has preserved for us a posthumous example—a\nparting shot, as it were, almost from the grave.  For among\nthe effects of this latter-day Mrs. Malaprop was found a piece\nof paper inscribed with the message: “No flowers, by my kind\nrequest.” <em>Finis coronat opus</em>!  Further comment would be\nanticlimactic.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
