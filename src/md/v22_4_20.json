In those articles, he spoke of his frustration with words inevitably creating meaning in the minds of literate readers and his search for an audience neither literate nor readers. Possibly Cardiff has been spared MTV, but we haven't. The idea that words strung together will inevitably make some sort of sense and conjure connections in a reader's mind has been vanquished by MTV. Stoat's insight was to mate words without apparent meaning to video images that move so rapidly and have so little intrinsic activity (as opposed to action, of which there is plenty) that no one can imagine what they're about. There is no time for reflection and savoring, no desire to be bombarded again. Nouns are often paired, but in ways that guarantee incomprehension. For instance, in one of his famous videos, a haddock (or some other large fish) was on the screen for a moment while a vocalist [<em>sic</em>] sang about a light bulb.
