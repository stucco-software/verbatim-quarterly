A\nmischievous rascal, Matthew Merrygreek, reads aloud to Dame\nChristian Custance a letter from Ralph designed to “win a\nwoman.”  He reads as follows (the punctuation is by Baskerville,\n<em>et al., Elizabethan and Stuart Plays</em>, 1934):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sweet mistress, whereas I love you nothing at all,<br>\nRegarding your substance and richesse chief of all,<br>\nFor your personage, beauty, demeanor, and wit,<br>\nI commend me unto you never a whit;<br>\nSorry to hear report of your good welfare,<br>\nFor, as I hear say, such your conditions are,<br>\nThat ye be worthy favor of no living man;<br>\nTo be abhorred of every honest man;<br>\nTo be taken for a woman inclined to vice;<br>\nNothing at all to virtue giving her due price.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After twenty-five more lines of similar sentiment, Dame\nCustance is insulted, and Ralph, standing near, is utterly\nconfused by the effect of the letter he hoped would “win a\nwoman.”  We learn shortly what he intended when the Scrivener\nreads the letter aloud, with appropriate attention to the\npointing (punctuation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sweet mistress, whereas I love you—nothing at all<br>\nRegarding your richesse and substance, chief of all<br>\nFor your personage, beauty, demeanor, and wit—<br>\nI commend me unto you; never a whit<br>\nSorry to hear report of your good welfare.<br>\nFor, as I hear say, such your conditions are<br>\nThat ye be worthy favor; of no living man<br>\nTo be abhorred; of every honest man<br>\nTo be taken for a woman inclined to vice<br>\nNothing at all; to virtue giving her due price.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Merrygreek's mischief is thereby exposed, and the Serivener\nexplains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then the fault was in the reading, and not in the\nwriting;</p>\n<p>No, nor I dare say in the form of the inditing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here <em>inditing</em> means the 'penning' or 'inscribing' (<em>OED</em> indite,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>and may be understood to argue that the pointing was\nappropriate.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clear rules—or more accurately, conventions—to guide\npunctuation practice were not established in the 16th century,\nso writers and editors and printers muddled along with whatever\nmarks caught their fancy.  Nevertheless, there was a\nconsciousness of pointing (certainly to indicate a full stop) so\nthat ambiguity of the sort illustrated outrageously in <em>Ralph\nRoister Doister</em> could be avoided.</p>\n<p>Shakespeare makes use of the misplaced stop device in <em>A\nMidsummer Night's Dream</em> (V.i.).  To introduce the Pyramis and\nThisbe scene, Quince, evidently reading, serves as Prologue\n(First Folio punctuation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we offend, it is with our good will.\nThat you should think, we come not to offend,\nBut with good will.  To show our simple skill,\nThat is the true beginning of our end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Consider the following (my punctuation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we offend, it is with our good will\nThat you should think we come not to offend,\nBut with good will to show our simple skill.\nThat is the true beginning of our end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a few more lines, also misread, the onlookers comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THESEUS: This fellow doth not stand upon points.</p>\n<p>LYSANDER: He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt;\nhe knows not the stop.  A good moral, my lord:\nit is not enough to speak,\nbut to speak true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Misplaced stops in these examples from the Elizabethan\nstage of course illustrate wrong delivery of the lines and are\nnot, strictly speaking, demonstration of faulty pointing, which\nwe do not really know about.  Only rarely can we see what an\nElizabethan playwright actually set down, and even then the\npointing is likely to be slapdash and inconsistent.  We can\nnevertheless turn Theseus' moral to the crux of Casler's\nillustration: it is not enough to punctuate, but to punctuate\ntrue.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
