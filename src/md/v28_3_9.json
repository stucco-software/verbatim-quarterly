In my\ndefence, let me note that my computer has the\nsame problem; its spellchecker doesn't recognise\n<em>spam</em> (unless it's typed with an upper case initial.)\nNo doubt VERBATIMreaders will be able to\nsort that one out for me. This column is always\ndelighted to hear from readers, via the magazine's\nusual addresses, commenting on Horribiles already\ndiscussed or nominating their own.</p>\n<p>In a recent issue, I wondered whether the\nPentagon's employment of teen slang was designed to\nlessen the impact of controversial statements. E.\nNoel Fletcher of Los Angeles takes this thought in a\ndifferent direction, by looking at the broadening of\nthe application of the term <em>rip off</em> in the 1960s. “By\ncalling both <em>rip offs,</em> activists suggested moral equivalency between an overcharge at a newsstand and a\nbank hold-up by radicals. Ultimately any profit from\nany activity was deemed to be a <em>rip off.</em> The usage was\nunthinkingly adopted by people who did not realize\ntheir acceptance and use of that terminology in daily\ndiscourse promoted a radical agenda.”</p>\n<p>Raymond Harris of north London forwarded a\nletter he'd received promising that “the book is finally on it's way to you,” and added this note:\n“Greengrocer's apostrophe—from a bookseller!” I\nwonder if Mr Harris was delighted or horrified by\nthis just plain errant apostrophe (not really a greengrocer's apostrophe, which is usually added to give an\nadded fillip to a plural, such as <em>banana's</em> ); both, I\nimagine, if he's anything like me.</p>\n<p>A number of people have suggested “complete\nstranger” as an example of superglued words; can there ever be a partial stranger? (Which reminds\nme, if you'll forgive the diversion, of a routine performed decades ago by the British comedy duo,\nMorecambe and Wise. “I'm not a complete idiot,\nyou know,” huffs the straight man. “Why,” replies\nthe comic, “which bit is missing?”)</p>\n<p>Sports commentators can generally be relied\nupon to help me fill this page. Lately, I've noticed\nthey've become very fond of using ordinary to\nmean bad : “England were worse than disappointing out there today, John, they were downright\nordinary.” Very ordinary has become quite common—if you see what I mean—but the other day I\nheard ordinariness taken to new heights, when an\nopening post-game gambit of “That was a very ordinary display by the boys today, John,” was effortlessly topped with “It was very ordinary indeed,\nJohn, shockingly ordinary—that was an extraordinarily ordinary performance by the boys.” Got\nthat? The boys weren't very good.</p>\n<p>I think I've just got space to briefly revisit an\nold favourite—the “parental guidance” plague, and\nthe strangulated euphemisms it gives rise to. A current British TV advertisement for a children's film\nis the first I've seen to warn that the picture\n“Contains mild language.” Shouldn't mild language\nbe the opposite of the dreaded strong language—\nand therefore desirable—or has language really\nbecome a synonym for obscenity?</p>\n<p>I'll end this time with an example of admirable\nhonesty on the part of a British politician. Hansard ,\nthe parliamentary record, recently recorded an\nexchange which began with an opposition MP asking:\n“I welcome any steps to try to improve the quality\nand depth of regulatory impact assessments, some of\nwhich, I think we all recognise, have been lamentably\nsuperficial, but would the honourable gentleman\nconsider the case for a system of routine post-implementation audit of regulatory impact assessments\nand the costs actually imposed on business by legislation, so that we can generate a feedback to the\nprocess of pre-legislative regulatory impact assessments that might over time improve their quality?”\nThe honourable gentleman in question replied:\n“I do not understand that.”</p>\n<p>[Have Horribiles for this column?
