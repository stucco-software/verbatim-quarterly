But consider the human and legal\nconsequences:</p>\n<p><em>Scenario 1:</em> A young European, visiting America,\nfalls in with bad company, and contracts a painful\ngambling debt.  Desperately, he cables to his rich uncle\nfor help.  Back comes a check dated 11-3-1981.  The\nSinister Syndicate, however, is not disposed to wait the\neight months till November; and the next frantic cabled\nrequest is for payment of medical bills.</p>\n<p><em>Scenario 2:</em> Calvin Q. Winterbottom, retired from a\nsuccessful career in Wall Street, is peacefully living out\nhis days in a small Mediterranean village.  Stricken by a\nsudden heart attack, he summons Mayor and Postmaster\nto his beside, to witness his signature under an important\ncouncil to his will.  Under this signature he scrawls,\nwith a failing hand, 4-18-1981.  The local courts refuse to\nrecognize the document, because there is no such thing\nas an eighteenth month, and by the time the confusion\nis straightened out, inflation has ravaged the estate.  The\ninnkeeper's daughter, for whose benefit the codicil was\nintended, gets very little.</p>\n<p>What can be done to protect the innkeeper's daughter?\nIt is a sad fact of life that, when the International\nStandards Organization speaks, few people listen.
