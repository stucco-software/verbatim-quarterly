Alan Wycherley, in the now defunct pamphlet\n<em>Word Study</em>, distinguished between the pure\nand impure uses of Slurvian.  Impure Slurvian produces\nnonsense sounds such as those listed above.  But\nSlurvian in its purest form mispronounces English\nwords into <em>other</em> English words.</p>\n<p>To help to translate Slurvian into English and to\npreserve the growing canon of non-enunciation, I\noffer VERBATIM verbivores a grotesque glossary of pure\nSlurvian.  The list is evenly split between entries from\nDavenport's and Wycherley's disquisitions and atrocities\nthat I have collected during the past five years.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>bar</em> to take temporarily: “May I bar your\neraser?”</p>\n<p><em>calvary</em> a mobile army unit: “At the last\nminute, the wagon train was saved by the\ncalvary;”  A rare example of spoonerized\nSlurvian.</p>\n<p><em>dense</em> a tooth expert.  “I have a dense\nappointment today.”</p>\n<p><em>forced</em> a large cluster of trees.  “Only you can\nprevent forced fires.”'</p>\n<p><em>formally</em> earlier.  “Today she's a millionaire\ninvestor, but formally she tried to make a living\nas an English teacher.”</p>\n<p><em>girl</em> an article of clothing.  “She had to work\nhard to get her girl on.”</p>\n<p><em>granite</em> conceded.  “Too many people take the\ngood life for granite.”</p>\n<p><em>intensive</em> an idiom, as in “for all intensive\npurposes,” rather than the correct “for all\nintents and purposes.”</p>\n<p><em>lays</em> the opposite of “gemmen.”  “Lays and\ngemmen, I now introduce our speaker.”</p>\n<p><em>less</em> contraction of “Let us.”  “Less get started.”</p>\n<p><em>lining</em> electrical flash of light.  “Thunder and\nlining.”</p>\n<p><em>Mayan</em> possessive pronoun.  “What's yours is\nyours, and what's Mayan is Mayan.”  A rare\nexample of Slurvian created by adding a\nsyllable.</p>\n<p><em>mere</em> a reflecting glass.  “Mere, mere on the\nwall, who's the fairest one of all?”</p>\n<p><em>mill</em> between the beginning and the end.  “A\ntable stood in the mill of the room.”</p>\n<p><em>mince</em> unit lasting sixty seconds.  “I'll be back in\na few mince.”</p>\n<p><em>neck store</em> adjacent.  “I'm in love with the girl\nneck store.”  A rare double play.</p>\n<p><em>nigh</em> opposite of day.  “She woke screaming in\nthe mill of the nigh.”</p>\n<p><em>of</em> have.  “I could of danced all night.”  Perhaps\nthe most common of all Slurvian examples.</p>\n<p><em>pain</em> giving money.  “I'm tired of pain these high\nprices.”</p>\n<p><em>pal</em> to propel a craft on water.  “It's your turn to\npal the canoe.”</p>\n<p><em>paramour</em> a modern grass-cutting instrument.\n“I mowed the lawn with my new paramour.”</p>\n<p><em>pitcher</em> an image or representation.  “As soon as\nwe get the pitcher framed, we'll hang it above\nthe sofa.”</p>\n<p><em>please</em> officers of the law.  “My house was\nrobbed! Call the please!”</p>\n<p><em>then</em> conjunction introducing an adverb clause\nof comparison.  “I can jerk more pounds then\nyou can.”</p>\n<p><em>torment</em> a competition.  “Mabel and I have\nentered the bridge torment.”</p>\n<p><em>whore</em> inspiring terror.  “Whore films always\nscare the pants off me.”</p>\n<p><em>win</em> movement of air.  “He was awakened in the\nmill of the nigh by flashes of lining and gusts of\nwin.”</p>\n<p><em>winner</em> opposite of summer.  “The Pilgrims\nfaced many a hard winner.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Slurvophobes unite!  Keep your ears open and\nyour notebooks handy, and send me more examples,\ncare of VERBATIM.  Together we can record an important\nsecond language in the United States and publish\na useful new lexicon—<em>The Concise Dictionary of\nAmerican Slurvian</em>.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
