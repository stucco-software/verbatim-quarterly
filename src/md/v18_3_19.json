Rybakin, (Second Improved and Enlarged Edition, Russky Yazyk Publishers, 1989), 222pp.</p>\n<p>When it comes to teaching materials for their\nEnglish students, the Russians are nothing if not\nthorough.  Here now, amid the standard course-books\nand grammars, is a specialist dictionary of\nEnglish personal names, or as we would probably\nprefer to call them, first names.  The modest paperback\ncan be regarded as a complementary volume to\nthe author's earlier work, <em>A Dictionary of English\nSurnames,</em> published in 1986.  It contains some\n4,000 first names, and as well as the main body of\nthe dictionary has a brief preface, a short section on\nthe history of English first names, a bibliography,\nand a separate listing of some 1,000 derivatives or\npet names, with cross references to their full form.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, one compares the main entries with\nthose in similar recent works, such as Leslie\nDunkling and William Gosling's <em>Everyman's Dictionary\nof First Names</em> (1983) and Patrick Hanks and\nFlavia Hodges' <em>A Dictionary of First Names</em> (1990).\nThe content and treatment fall somewhere between\nthe two, although the style is noticeably more succinct\nand less discursive.  Where Rybakin scores\nover the other two works is in the provision of\npronunciations and, for a main or source name, a\nselection of literary characters who bear it.  In the\nlatter respect it differs from Dunkling and Gosling,\nwho go more for real-life bearers, especially stage\nand screen celebrities, and from Hanks and Hodges,\nwhose representation of historic bearers is rather restricted.\nWhen a name is biblical and of Hebrew\norigin, too, Rybakin boldly goes where few lexicographers\nhave gone before and gives the actual Hebrew\n(albeit in Roman transliteration).</p>\n<p>A typical Rybakin main name entry has seven\nitems of information following the headword that is\nthe name itself: pronunciation (in IPA), gender, Russian\nform (both traditional and modern), language(s)\nof origin, ultimate literal meaning, examples of literary\nbearers, and derivatives.  Equivalents in other\nlanguages sometimes serve as an eighth item.  So\nhere he is, for example (in English translation, and\nwith abbreviations spelled out), on <em>Susan</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>SUSAN</em> ['su:zn], <em>feminine</em>, Suzan, <em>earlier</em> Suzan,\n<em>from French</em> Susanne, Suzanne, <em>from Late Latin</em>\nSusanna, <em>from Greek</em> Sousanna, <em>from Hebrew</em>\nshūshannāh, 'lily', <em>see</em> SUSANNA, SUSANNAH.  SUSAN\nIS CHARACTER IN THOMAS HEYWOOD'S PLAY <em>A\nWoman Killed with Kindness</em> (1607).  Susan Pearson\nis character in Charlotte Bront&amp;euml's novel <em>Shirley</em>\n(1849).  Derivatives: SUE, SUEY, SUKE, SUKEY,\nSUKIE, SUKY, SUSIE, SUSY, SUZY.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An entry like this has its good and bad points.  It\nis good to have the name traced back through the\ndifferent languages to its Hebrew original; but the\ninclusion of just two literary Susans (out of what\nmust be hundreds) tells us little, except perhaps that\nthe name was already in general English use in the\nearly 17th century.  (As their role models Dunkling\nand Gosling prefer the popular actresses Susan Hayward,\nSusan Hampshire, and Susan Strasberg, while\nHanks and Hodges instance no individual Susan at\nall, literary or otherwise.)</p>\n<p>Rybakin's range of names is comprehensive.  As\nwell as all the expected first names, old and new,\nthat appear in dictionaries of this type, he includes\nnames that are more familiar from the Bible and literature\nthan everyday life, so that his letter <em>G</em>, for\ninstance, takes in <em>Galahad</em> and <em>Ganymede</em> and his\nletter <em>P Pliny</em> and <em>Psyche</em>, none of which appears in\nthe other two books.  But even if almost no one is\nnow (or ever) called by these names, it is excellent\nto have a book that gives their origins, if only for\npurely academic interest.</p>\n<p>Rybakin's etymologies are mostly quite sound\nand accord with current scholarship.  However, he\nproposes a source in Latin <em>ancillus</em>, 'servant' for <em>Lancelot</em>,\nwhich like most names in the Arthurian cycle\nis almost certainly of Celtic origin.  He also offers the\nhoary old 'bitterness' or 'rebelliousness' for <em>Mary</em>,\nwhereas it is now thought that the name derives\nfrom the Hebrew root element <em>MRH</em> meaning literally\n'to be plump,' so in a transferred sense 'strong,'\n'beautiful.'</p>\n<p>In a bare six and a half pages Rybakin takes us\non a crash course in the history of English first\nnames, from Anglo-Saxon <em>Æthelbeald</em> to the titlederived\nnames of modern times such as <em>Duke</em> and\n<em>Earl</em>.  He rightly devotes part of his survey to a consideration\nof surnames as first names, although in his\nmain entries names of this type such as <em>Bradley,\nChester, Clifford,</em> and <em>Seymour</em> are simply explained\nas deriving 'from the surname.'  Dunkling and Gosling\nand Hanks and Hodges, on the other hand, take\nsuch names back to their own origin, often in a\nplace-name.  But maybe Rybakin felt that thus far is\nfar enough, and that for surname origins the reader\nis best advised to consult a different dictionary, such\nas his own.</p>\n<p>Armed with both his books and, of course, a\nknowledge of Russian, one has a guide to English\npersonal names that would be a useful addition to\nanyone's reference shelves.</p>\n<p><em>[Adrian Room, Stamford, Lincolnshire]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
