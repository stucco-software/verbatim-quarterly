The editing has been rather careless,\nthough, as the opening line of HOW TO USE THIS DICTIONARY\nbears witness in referring to itself at <em>The\nPenguin Dictionary of</em>... when it clearly has become\n<em>The Logodaedalian's</em>...</p>\n<p>There are some other curiosities, not confined\nto the unusual words selected but to their usage by\nthe author: in the Introduction he refers to an episode\nin which his father completed his Bachelor's\ndegree “at the behest of the Marine Corps.”  The\nday the US Marine Corps issues “behests” for Bachelor's\ndegrees is not yet here.  Another item in the\nsame section refers to “forebearing” friends, who I\nassume are those who had offspring before the author\n(clearly a woman using a nom de plume).</p>\n<p>The situation scarcely improves in the dictionary\nitself.  Saussy III does not know what <em>hysteresis</em>\nmeans and missed Pynchon's metaphor by a mile;\n<em>horripilating</em> does not mean 'shuddering' (though\nthe rest of the definition is correct); <em>houghmagandy</em>\nis defined as 'fucking as a pastime,' the last three\nwords of which make in inaccurate; the usual spelling\nof <em>gallimaufrey</em> is without the <em>e; gibbous</em>, usually\napplied to the three-quarter moon, is here\ndefined as “hump-backed, arched” with the citation,\n“...her upper lip gibbous...as the moon—,”\n(from pynchon) in which it means 'swollen'; <em>guddle</em>,\n“to use a fishing technique involving the use of only\nthe hands, to grope” is not quite correct: it is 'to (try\nto) catch a fish (esp. a trout) by tickling its underbelly'\n(which is actually easier than it sounds); and\n<em>gurn, girn</em>, is incorrectly defined as “to snarl, to\nshow the teeth in anger”: it really means 'to make\nfaces.'</p>\n<p>So much for the relative value of the definitions,\nof which the preceding are only a sample.  The interesting\nthing in the book is its words list, taken from a\nrelatively small corpus of books including ones by\nBurgess, Vonnegut, and (especially) Alexander Theroux\n(<em>Darconville's Cat</em>), all of them writers who enjoy\nplaying with the language.  The last-named book\nis largely a spoof on linguistic pedantry, and I fear\nthat Saussy III has been drawn in.  It is a pity that he\nmade so many unwarranted assumptions about the\nmeanings of words he did not understand, could not\ndivine from the context, or failed to find elsewhere.</p>\n<p>There may be some readers who enjoyed the\ntwo earlier editions and are craving more.  If so, they\nmight be induced to buy this edition because it contains\n55 pages of words, definitions, and citations not\npreviously published.  There are, I suppose, worse\nthings that could happen to you than buying and\nreading this book, but it is hard to think of any at the\nmoment.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
