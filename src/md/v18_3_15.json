Italians use almost\nexclusively brown-shelled eggs.  These eggs\nare harder shelled and the yolk is really quite red or\nreddish-orange.  American eggs look quite anemic\nnext to Italian eggs.  Another word for yolk is <em>tuorlo</em>,\nbut <em>rosso</em> is more accurate if you want to describe\nthe color.</p>\n<p>Speaking of eggs, why do we English speakers\ntalk of the egg white when it is really clear until it is\ncooked or beaten?
