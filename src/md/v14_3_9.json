Good advice, really, but it is a safe bet most of\nthose mothers were not travelers.  Consider, for example,\na daughter raised in this tradition who arrives at\nher London hotel at 8 a.m., bleary-eyed from the\ntrans-Atlantic flight, only to be rudely informed that\nno room will be available till three, and, anyway, they\ncannot find her reservation.  She will turn blue in the\nface and have veins pulsing pizzicato in the whites of\nher eyes if she is then required to say something nice.\nMuch better for the blood pressure to cut one's sniveling\nadversary down to size—if only to one's spouse,\nand in muttered undertones.</p>\n<p>It has, of course, been done before—and done\nwell.  Ogden Nash, an otherwise amiable soul, once\nspent 60 lines of verse venting his spleen on a sneering\nclerk at “an inn so vile, an inn so shameless,/For very\ndisgust I leave it nameless.”  Indeed, the occasional misfortunes\nof travel have inspired some of the great writers\nof the ages.  Thus after an unhappy stop at a place\ncalled The Three Crosses, Jonathan Swift suggested\nthat the innkeeper pin his wife to the sign out front\nand make it four.  Swift, the great master of savage\nindignation, also neatly squashed the entire populace\nof historic Chester in a poem of six concise lines:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Walls of this Town<br>\nAre full of renown,<br>\nAnd strangers delight to walk round 'em:<br>\nBut as for the dwellers,<br>\nBoth buyers and sellers,<br>\nFor me, you may hang 'em, or drown 'em.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While it has never precisely been celebrated, this\nsort of vituperative travel writing constitues a literary\nsub-genre.  I began collecting instances of it when I\nwas living for several months in Swift's old neighborhood\nin Dublin.  The result was an anthology of poison\npenmanship, on travel and other vexing subjects,\ncalled <em>The Devil's Book of Verse</em>.  (The Dodd, Mead\nhardcover is available from The Deep River Book Co.,\nP.O. Box 64, Deep River, CT 06417, $17.30 postpaid.)\nThe genre, I found, has ancient roots.  The Greek poet\nDemodocus, for example, did not much like natives of\nthe Cappadocia district of Turkey.  In 537 B.C., he\nwrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A viper bit a Cappadocian's hide<br>\nAnd poisoned by his blood that instant died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in the thirteenth century A.D., Robert de Brunne\ndeclared:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Frenchmen sin in lechery,<br>\nEnglishmen in ennui.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The authors of these unpleasantries were by no means\nall predictable misanthropic sorts.  Rupert Brooke, the\nWorld War I poet best known for writing that his\nsoldier's grave in a foreign field would be “forever England,”\nalso once wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cambridge people rarely smile,<br>\nBeing urban, squat, and packed with guile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Coleridge, celebrated for his imaginary travels\nin Xanadu, also evidently visited more earthly\ndestinations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Cologne, a town of monks and bones,<br>\nAnd pavements fanged with murderous stones<br>\nAnd rags, and hags, and hideous wenches;<br>\nI counted two and seventy stenches,<br>\nAll well defined, and several stinks!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Travelers have unleashed their anger even (or maybe I\nshould say especially) on the world's grandest cities.\nThus, in a small way, Anthony Brode brought <em>la ville\nlumiére</em> into perspective when he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Paris is simply disgusting;<br>\nNobody's said it before,<br>\nBut the Metro is rusting,<br>\nThe Louvre needs dusting,<br>\nThe women are plain and<br>\nI'm sick of the Seine and<br>\nIt smells like a drain and<br>\nIn fact I find Paris a bore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The poetic batterings occasionally administered to\nLondon's image have also been of a corrective variety.\nAlmost everyone is by now sick to death of Samuel\nJohnson's endlessly repeated declaration, “When a\nman is tired of London, he is tired of life.”  Isn't it\npleasant then to reflect that, 40 years before he uttered\nthat remark, Johnson himself described London in\nthese terms?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here malice, rapine, accident, conspire,<br>\nAnd now a rabble rages, now a fire;<br>\nTheir ambush here relentless ruffians lay,<br>\nAnd here the fell attorney prowls for prey;<br>\nHere falling houses thunder on your head,<br>\nAnd here a female atheist talks you dead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would be gratifying to think that in the 40-year\ninterval London had taken note of Johnson's poem and\namended its ways.</p>\n<p>But in truth, I know of only one case where a\ntraveler's malediction has actually produced something\nlike the desired result.  An Irish eccentric named Patrick\nO'Kelly once lost his watch and chain in the town\nof Doneraile.  In a prolonged fury, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>May fire and Brimstone never fail,<br>\nTo fall in showers on Doneraile.<br>\nMay all the leading fiends assail,<br>\nThe thieving town of Doneraile,<br>\nAs lightnings flash across the vale,<br>\nSo down to Hell with Doneraile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>O'Kelly's curse ran to 84 lines, and in one form or\nanother it evidently made the rounds.  When one of the\nlocal gentry kindly replaced the lost watch, perhaps\nwith a view to restoring Doneraile's good name,\nO'Kelly promptly recanted, announcing his blessings\non the poor community at equal length.  The reader\nwho wades through all this verbiage will certainly\nagree that malediction is more fun than benediction.\nBut there is a more timely lesson to be learned from\nO'Kelly's case: It is possible to dispatch your adversaries\nwith strong language rather than, for instance,\nwith plastic explosives.  A deftly-phrased malediction\ncan make its target squirm in his castle or cower behind\nthe hotel reservations desk.</p>\n<p>Now I do not seriously expect our leading terrorists\nto take this hint, but think of the possibilities.\nIambic tetrameter by the scalding reamful would be\ncheaper than an Uzi submachine gun, and not nearly\nas messy.  Nor would it be suicidal, except perhaps in\nrare instances.  And it might even work.</p>\n<p>After all, didn't O'Kelly get his watch back?</p>",
