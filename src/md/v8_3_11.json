Packer, M.C. Tenney, Wm. White, Jr., eds., (Thomas Nelson, 1980), 765 pp. incl. index.</p>\n<p>The editors of this volume state that its purpose, as\nunderstood by both the eleven major and the thirty-five\nsupplemental contributors (plus four editorial consultants\nand two project coordinators) is “to present in\nplain terms the information that is most helpful in\ninterpreting the Bible accurately” (p. 13).  That “accurately”\nmeans “conservatively” is made clear from the\nbeginning editorial introductions right through to the\nend of the final article.  The effort to defend such a\nviewpoint in light of both intra- and extra-Biblical evidence\noccupies many lines of text.  The bulk of the\n<em>Almanac</em> consists of forty-six topical articles: “The\nAncient World,” “Plants and Herbs,” “Money and Economics,”\n“Family Relationships,” “Food and Eating\nHabits,” “Music,” and the like.  The articles are supplemented\nby many interesting maps, charts, and pictures.\nSome of the color plates are stunning.  Authors of individual\narticles are not identified, and footnotes referring\nto other published works are rare, those to major scholarly\nresources virtually absent.  Protestant in orientation,\nthe authors use the King James translation as normative\nand give little attention to the <em>Apocrypha</em>, regarded as\ncanonical by Roman Catholics.</p>\n<p>The forty-six articles are of rather uneven quality.\nSome of them are well done.  “Language and Writing” is\nwell and carefully written, and “Archaeology” is also\none of the better treatments.  “The Egyptians” gives\njudicious treatment to its subject matter, and, given the\nlimitations imposed by a conservative-fundamentalist\noutlook, the section “The Literature of the Bible” is\nuseful.</p>\n<p>Other sections are less valuable.  “The Geography of\nPalestine” has too many errors (e.g., p. 197, 7 to 15 cm is\nsaid to equal 36 to 60 inches, 26 km² to equal 68 square\nmiles; p. 196, referring to <em>Hosea</em> 6:4: “Yet the dew\nevaporates quickly, and it became proverbial to compare\nIsrael's faithfulness to dew”—clearly “faithlessness” is\nmeant; p. 201, referring to <em>2 Kings</em> 6:1-7: “Elisha made\nan iron axe handle float on the river”—it was an axe\n<em>head;</em> p. 205, in reference to <em>Acts</em> 8:1-6: “When the\nearly church was persecuted in Jerusalem and all the\napostles scattered”—a close look at <em>Acts</em> 8:1 shows all\nfled “<em>except</em> the apostles”).  Such errors are unfortunately\nfar too prevalent in this <em>Almanac;</em> one could fill a\nreview of this length simply by identifying them.</p>\n<p>Another section, “The Poetry of the Bible,” contains\ndisturbing contradictions (p. 371, paragraph 5: “The\n<em>Book of Psalms</em> stands apart from any other poetic\nliterature of the ancient Near East”; same page, paragraph\n2: “The artistic style of Biblical poetry closely\nresembles Ugaritic and Babylonian poetry”; p. 372:\n“The language of the Psalms resembles the poetry of\nthe ancient city of Ugarit”; or again, p. 362, paragraph 1:\n“Paul's epistles (as the rest of the New Testament\nepistles) are unique literary productions.  They differ\nfrom all letter forms found in extra-Biblical literature”;\nsame page, paragraphs 2 and 3 describe the “literary\nform” of “extra-Biblical letters”; same page, paragraph\n4: “Paul's letters follow this general structure”).  Such\ncontradictions are also unfortunately far too prevalent in\nthis volume; one could fill <em>another</em> review of this length\nsimply by identifying them.</p>\n<p>The section on “Forms of Government” is simplistic\nand limited in view.  There is nothing in it on the\nform of theocratic covenant on which Israel based its\nlife as a nation and on which Hittite archaeology has\nthrown a flood of light.  The section on “Marriage and\nDivorce” would have profited from a survey of contemporary\nextra-Biblical customs, especially in light of <em>Mark</em>\n10:12, where a woman divorcing her husband was in\ntotal contradiction to the law of Moses (cf. p. 438).  These\nand other sections are little more than a catalog of\npertinent Biblical materials, with no references to other\ncontemporary cultural practices.</p>\n<p>It is the many annoying errors and contradictions,\nhowever, that make the <em>Almanac</em> less valuable than it\notherwise might have been.  Some errors are probably\nowing to careless editing (e.g., p. 232, the Greek word\nfor 'dove,' <em>peristera</em>, is wrongly given as <em>periatera</em>; p.\n356, <em>cosmogony</em> 'the story of the birth of the cosmos' is\ndefined as though it were <em>theogony</em> 'a biography of the\ngods'; p. 587, Chapter 5 is simply omitted from the\noutline of Paul's epistle to the Romans).  Others are more\nserious, particularly in a volume that takes the Bible\nseriously as history.  For example, there are historical\nerrors.  On p. 173, we read that the Maccabean revolt\nbegan when “only a few men escaped into the hills\nunder Judas Maccabeus.”  In fact, the revolt began\nunder his father, Mattathias Hashmon; Judas was the\nthird of his five sons.  The facts are correctly given\nelsewhere (pp. 177, 409), but how is the nonexpert to\nknow which account is true?  Again, referring to Herod's\nTemple (begun in 20 B.C.), we learn: “In fact, some\nscholars feel the new temple had not been completed at\nthe time Jerusalem fell to the Roman general Pompey in\nA.D. 63” (p. 409).  In fact, Pompey took Jerusalem in 63\nB.C.  It was Titus who took Jerusalem in A.D. 70, the\nevent to which the author apparently wanted to refer.</p>\n<p>Along with historical, there are Biblical errors.  For\nexample, we are told (p. 521): “Christ ascended into\nheaven (<em>John</em> 24:49-53)”.  <em>John</em> has only 21 chapters;\napparently the reference was intended to be <em>Luke</em>\n24:49-53.  That ought to have been caught in editing, as\nalso the incorrect <em>Luke</em> 4:30-39, cited on p. 515 (right\ncolumn, near the bottom).  The correct reference is <em>Luke</em>\n5:33-39.  More serious are the errors that arise from an\napparent ignorance of the content of the Bible, where\nspeculation is substituted for what the Bible actually\nsays.  For example (p. 219): “This explains why Jesus'\ndisciples rebuked the woman who broke an alabaster\nvessel of perfume and poured the perfume upon Jesus'\nhead (<em>Mark</em> 14:3).  The disciples felt she was wasting a\nprecious scent that could have been enjoyed for years.”\nYet <em>Mark</em> says specifically (14:4-5) that the disciples\nrebuked her because the perfume could have been sold\n(for 300 denarii) and given to the poor.  In some\ninstances, one wonders if the author has even bothered\nto read Scripture.  For example (p. 506): “Jesus' teachings\nabout a person's diet (<em>Mark</em> 7:1-9), respect for\nelders (<em>Mark</em> 7:10-13) and Sabbath keeping (<em>Matt</em>.\n12:24-32) agreed with the teachings of the Pharisees.”\nIn each instance cited, Jesus is <em>attacking</em>, explicitly, the\nview of the Pharisees on those matters.  Such errors,\nwhich occur with alarming frequency, are hard to understand\non the part of authors who claim to take Scripture\nwith utmost seriousness.</p>\n<p>In sum, a good idea, a Biblical almanac, is badly\nflawed by too many errors, contradictions, wrong references,\nspeculations stated as fact (e.g., “John the Baptist\nwas a Nazarite,” p. 513; “Matthew 23:23 mentions\ncertain spices as antacids,” p. 464), and poor editing that\nought to have caught many of these errors.  When accurate\nmaterial is interspersed with the inaccurate, how is\nthe layperson, for whom this almanac was written, to\ndistinguish between the two?  For an “accurate interpretation”\nof Scripture, this particular almanac, despite its\nlovely color plates, will be of less help than one would\nhave hoped.</p>\n<p><em>[Paul J.
