Room's <em>Confusibles</em> is\none of those books that one thinks might be useful, and so\npurchases, and probably does in fact use on occasions.  A confusible\nis, according to Room, 'a word that not only resembles\nanother in spelling and pronunciation, but one that additionally\nhas a similar or associated meaning' (p. 2).  As such, they\noccur in pairs, and Room lists about 800 in short articles, arranged\nalphabetically, on pairs or groups of words.  They include\nthe <em>it's/its</em> pair ('possibly two of the commonest confusibles\nin the language'), <em>imply/infer</em>, even <em>stalactite/stalagmite</em>,\nwith a handy mnemonic working on the inclusion of one letter,\n'C for <em>c</em>eiling, G for ground.'  More technical words are\nalso discussed—<em>Oxford Group/Oxford movement, umlaut/\nablaut, poplin/Crimplene/Terylene</em> and obscure pairs such as\n<em>sinecure/cynosure</em>.  Room's style is informal and the articles\nare brief, his main concern being to be clear.  Cross references\nare good.  The book also has an appendix of prefixes and suffixes\nwith details of the meaning, language of origin, examples,\nand variant spellings.</p>\n<p>The book is clearly designed for the native speaker of\nEnglish who never <em>can</em> remember the difference between <em>x</em>\nand <em>y</em>, rather than the foreign learner.  It fills a gap well.  One\ncould obviously list omissions: some that come to mind are\n<em>oriented/orientated, due to/owing to, upstream/downstream</em>,\nand the inclusion of <em>theatricals</em> with <em>hysterics/histrionics</em>.</p>\n<p>Hudson's book is more a commentary on the language\nthan notes on distinguishing confusibles.  His starting point is\nthat English is a diseased language, by which he means that\nEnglish 'either deliberately or unconsciously, is used with so\nserious a lack of precision that it ceases to be an effective\nmeans of communication and serves only to confuse or mislead'\n(p. xix).  Clearly, much redundant jargon is criticized:\nhere are the statements in alphabetically arranged entries on\nbeing <em>aware</em> (of nothing, just 'aware'), providing <em>back-up</em>,\nhaving <em>charisma</em>, with consequent <em>grass-root</em> support, and of\ncourse <em>hopefully</em> having an <em>on-going, meaningful</em>, but nevertheless\n<em>low-key relationship</em> at the <em>interface</em> in a particular\n<em>situation</em>.</p>\n<p>Hudson illustrates his statements with quotations from a\nwide variety of sources (taken over the ten years 1966-76),\nfrom menus to broadcast news bulletins, but mainly from\nnewspapers.  U.S. and Australian usage is reflected as well as\nBritish English.  One annoying feature is the occurrence of a\nfew entries with headwords such as 'definite article' (referring\nthen to its omission, as in <em>Prime Minister Callaghan</em>, instead\nof <em>the Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan</em>).  These occur in the\nsame form as the headwords for particular words which make\nup the rest of the book.</p>\n<p>Hudson goes a definite step further than Room: Room\noffers a descriptive rather than prescriptive book; Hudson explicitly\nwrites that he is not culturally neutral: and he is at\npains to issue a call to arms to stop the spread of the disease\naffecting the language.  If one can accept Hudson's self-confessed\nprejudices (e.g., against social scientists, and in\nfavor of the wine-correspondent of the London <em>Times</em>), one\ncan find this book entertaining.</p>\n<p>Both books reflect current works on the changing English\nlanguage.  Both are useful alongside Philip Howard's <em>New\nWords for Old</em> (Hamish Hamilton, London, 1977), and <em>Words</em>\n(1975) and <em>More Words</em> (1977) both published by BBC, London,\nin providing reflections on current English.  Room's is the\nmore permanent, but Hudson's the more significant in critically\nlooking at the present condition of the language.</p>\n<p><em>[Martin Manser, Aylesbury, England]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
