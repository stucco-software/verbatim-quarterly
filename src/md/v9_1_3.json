About half the secretaries were French, and the\nothers English.  However, all were skilled in both languages, so\nthe letters could be dictated to any secretary.  The instructions\nabout the number of copies to be typed were given in the\ntypist's mother tongue.  So you would say to an English\nspeaker: “Six copies, please,” and you would get six letters.  On\nthe other hand, if you requested “<em>Six copies, s'il vous plaît</em>”\nfrom a French employee, chances are your letter would be\ntyped sevenfold.  In the French office, <em>copies</em> is understood to\nmean 'carbon copies,' not counting the original.  A copy too\nmany does little harm, but the effects of this confusion were\nquite irritating for my French colleagues, who often received a\ncopy too few.  And, although everybody knew about the catch,\nmisunderstandings kept popping up, because each tended to\nstick to his or her own linguistic habits.</p>\n<p>This situation is by no means unique.  Many English\nspeakers now and again come across a French word that at first\nsight seems to be the equivalent of an English one: the spelling\nis similar or even identical, and both occur in the same sort of\ncontext.  There appears to be every reason to believe that the\ntwo have the same meaning.  But they don't.  Almost, but not\nquite; or sometimes, but not usually.  For instance, French\n<em>éventuel</em> ought not to be translated 'eventual,' but rather by\n'possible,' whereas the French counterparts of <em>eventual</em> are\nwords like 'final' and 'ultime.'  In the same way, <em>actuel</em> is\n'present' or 'current,' rather than 'actual,' and the latter is best\nrendered in French by <em>réel</em>, or <em>concret</em>, or <em>effectif</em>, or indeed\n<em>présent</em>.  To make things even more confusing, there are also\ninstances where the meanings of <em>actuel</em> and 'actual' do in fact\noverlap.</p>\n<p>These examples are classics, but it is not too difficult to\nfind more of the same kind.  In fact, that's exactly what the\nFrenchmen Koessler and Derocquigny did more than half a\ncentury ago in their little book <em>Les Faux Amis</em> (False Friends).\nOne large category of their finds can be traced back to French\nwords adopted in England during Norman rule, whose meanings\nsubsequently evolved along different lines in each country.\nFor instance, <em>procés</em> and 'process' are false friends, because the\nformer nowadays means 'trial,' and the latter should be\ntranslated by <em>processus</em>.  To express the present meaning of 'to\ncontrol,' you have to use words like <em>maîtriser, dominer</em> or\n<em>diriger</em>, while <em>contrôler</em> has stuck to its original meaning of 'to\nverify.'  To complicate the situation even more, the English\nsense is admitted in modern French in certain cases, especially\nin loan translations, such as <em>contrôle des naissances</em> 'birth\ncontrol.'  (Conversely, what about an English expression like\n'passport control'?)  Another example is 'female.'  The English\nterm is applicable to all species, but the French <em>femelle</em> is no\nlonger in use in respect of the human race—not in nice speech,\nat least.  (I have been told that Canadian French has diverged\nless from its origins on this point.)</p>\n<p><em>Faux amis</em> have not sprung only from French words that\nmigrated to England to lead a life of their own.  Another\ncategory is made up of words both languages borrowed directly\nfrom Latin, especially during the Roman occupation or as\necclesiastical terms.  A striking example of the latter is 'curate,'\na function which corresponds to <em>vicaire</em> on the other side of the\nChannel.  A French <em>curé</em> is a parish priest; so, in a Church of\nEngland context, the correct translation would be 'vicar'—a\nperfect cross-cousin marriage.  Less intricate examples are\n'library' <em>bibliothéque</em> \\neq\\ <em>librairie</em> 'bookshop,' 'infant' <em>bébé</em> or\n<em>enfant en bas âge</em> \\neq\\ <em>enfant</em> 'child,' 'sane' <em>sain d'esprit</em> \\neq\\ <em>sain</em>\n'healthy,' and 'salary' <em>traiteman</em> \\neq\\ <em>salaire</em> 'wages.'</p>\n<p>Obviously, French and English also have words in common\nthat are drawn from other languages.  Examples of ensuing\n<em>faux amis</em> are sparse, but I could perhaps point out <em>couque</em> and\n'cookie,' both derived from Dutch <em>koek</em> 'cake.'  The two varieties\nof pastry are <em>quite</em> different.</p>\n<p>A relatively new category consists of “second degree <em>faux\namis</em>,” English words whose specifically American meaning\ndiffers from that of their French cognates.  For example, how\nmuch is a billion?  In France, where such issues are <em>officially</em>\ndecided upon, it is a thousand times more than in the United\nStates.  Before World War II, the British leaned toward the\nFrench system (US 'billion' = <em>milliard</em>), but an increasing\nnumber of their financial institutions conform with American\nusage.  Some try to avoid the problem with an uncommitting\n“1,000 million,” but they get into trouble with <em>trillion</em>.</p>\n<p>Not all <em>faux amis</em> have their roots in the distant past.  A\nrelatively young pair are 'brassiere' and <em>soutien-gorge</em> \\neq\\ <em>brassiére</em>.\nThe latter word is nowadays used only for certain\nchildren's gear, expecially leading-strings ('reins' in Britain).\nAgain a garment: 'slip' <em>combinaison</em> \\neq\\ <em>slip</em> 'briefs.'  This\ndemonstrates that <em>faux amis</em> can originate on the English side\nof the Channel.  One more of this kind, from the world of\nmotor cars: 'starter' <em>démarreur</em> \\neq\\ <em>starter</em> 'choke.'</p>\n<p>The last two examples really result from the advent of\n<em>Franglais</em>, a recent phenomenon <em>Les Faux Amis</em> does not, of\ncourse, deal with.  However, the modest booklet has grown into\na weighty volume with a long, learned introduction in its sixth\nedition, published by Vuibert, Paris 1975.  It is all very thorough,\nbut hunting for <em>faux amis</em> can be just a hobby, free from\nscientific pretensions.  If you would like to build a <em>faux amis</em>\ncollection of your own, the material abounds.  Few of the\nexamples used in this article, for example, appear in the book.</p>\n<p>True false friends derive from the same root.  So don't pair\n'core' with <em>coeur</em> 'heart,' because the two words have, in spite\nof a certain similarity in spelling and a semblance of semantic\nkinship, no common forebear (unless you go back to Sanskrit,\nperhaps, but remember: it is an amateur game).  Secondly, even\ngenuinely false friends do not always show an all-round\ndifference of meaning.  In other words, you often have to settle\nfor a partial overlap of meaning.  Let us therefore agree that a\ndifference between the most frequently used meanings suffices.\nFor instance, 'talon' <em>serre</em> \\neq\\ <em>talon</em> 'heel' make an almost pure\ncouple, but 'to chant' <em>psalmodier</em> \\neq\\ <em>chanter</em> 'to sing' show\nsome overlapping, because 'to chant' sometimes stands for 'to\nsing.'  Partial candidates are 'to assist' <em>aider</em> \\neq\\ <em>assister</em> 'to\nattend,' 'chamber' <em>salle</em> \\neq\\ <em>chambre</em> 'room,' 'parole' <em>parole\nd'honneur</em> \\neq\\ <em>parole</em> 'word,' 'gallant' <em>vaillant</em> \\neq\\ <em>galant\n'courtly</em>,' 'psychic' surnaturel \\neq\\ <em>psychique</em> 'psychological.'\nWhen a man plans to entertain a French lady, he had better\nnot speak of <em>entretenir</em> her.  The most benevolent interpretation\nof his words would be that he proposes to converse with her.</p>\n<p>It follows that you will have to apply standards for the\nmeaning of 'meaning,' or rather of 'difference of meaning.'  In a\ncase like <em>éditeur</em> 'publisher' \\neq\\ 'editor' <em>rédacteur</em>, the difference\nis clear enough, but what about 'versatile' and <em>versatile</em>?  I\nwould indeed classify these two as <em>faux amis</em>, on the grounds\nthat the former expresses a positive quality and the French\ncounterpart is anything but complimentary, perhaps best translated\nby 'time-serving.'  Others may not wish to take such\ndifferences in moral content into account.  A case more difficult\nto define is 'sympathetic' \\neq\\ <em>sympathique</em> (the closest 'English'\nequivalent of the latter seems to be 'simpatico').  You may also\nchoose to include word pairs of which one member is used\nexclusively in the figurative sense, whereas the other has kept\nits literal meaning ('meager' \\neq\\ <em>maigre</em> 'lean').  In some pairs,\none member has an archaic or literary flavor, but the other\nbelongs to everyday language ('felon' \\neq\\ <em>felon</em>).  Even lesser\ndifferences in style could do: 'soup' <em>potage</em> \\neq\\ <em>soupe</em> (colloquial),\nwhile <em>potage</em> \\neq\\ pottage.</p>\n<p>Remember also that French is not the only possible\npartner to English for this game; Germanic languages serve just\nas well.  Some research in this direction has already been done.\nPerusing dictionaries can be rewarding, but the most endearing\nfinds stem from real-life situations, like the carbon copy case\nrecounted above.  By the way, we eventually decided to say just\n'One plus five, please.'</p>",
