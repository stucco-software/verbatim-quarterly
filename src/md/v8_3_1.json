G. Blakemore Evans (Boston: Houghton\nMifflin Company, 1974).  Hereinafter cited in text.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HAM: Good lads, how do you both?<br>\nROS: As the indifferent children of the earth.<br>\nGUIL: Happy, in that we are not over-happy, on<br>\nFortune's cap we are not the very button<br>\nHAM: Nor the soles of her shoe?<br>\nROS: Neither, my lord.<br>\nHAM: Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?<br>\nGUIL: Faith, her privates we.<br>\nHAM: In the secret parts of Fortune?  O, most true; she is a strumpet.</p>\n<p>(2.2.225—36)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The metaphor suggested itself because Fortune, with her\nunsteady Wheel, is fickle and inconstant, as strumpets were\ncommonly thought to be.  But if strumpets themselves have\nbeen inconstant in the popular mind, then it is certainly apt\nthat the fortunes of their distinctive epithets have been equally\ninconstant, for, historically, speakers of English have licentiously\njumped from term to whorish term to describe practitioners\nof the oldest, most venerable of human occupations.</p>\n<p>We have therefore inherited scores of synonyms for <em>prostitute</em>\nthat seemingly cover—or, rather, uncover—every possible\nnuance of the scortatory hierarchy, from the tinselly, grand\n<em>courtesan</em> to the abject, base <em>slut</em>.  In fact, the synonyms for\n<em>prostitute</em> probably outnumber those of any other comparably\nspecific meaning.  Why is this?  Perhaps it is because those in\nthe underworld, who are most deeply involved with prostitution,\nhave the raciest argot (almost invariably ephemeral) and\nwield words more boldly, loosely, and inventively than other\nspeakers.  Or perhaps it results from a popular fixation with the\nless pleasant, seedier aspects of human existence.  Then again, it\nmay demonstrate that we are perennially witness to more vice\nthan virtue.</p>\n<p>However that may be, and whether we find prostitution a\nbarbarous, abhorrent practice or a desirable societal peccadillo,\nit is of interest to word-lovers to see how the copious English\nappellations for prostitutes have developed and changed\nthrough the centuries.  Many of these terms exemplify the witty\nand ironic creativeness of English speakers; my own favorite in\nthis regard is <em>laced mutton</em>, a British slang phrase current in\nthe 16th—18th centuries, in which the ambiguity of <em>laced</em> is\nquite effective.  It might mean 'bedizened with lace,' 'corseted,'\n'tenderized,' 'slightly squiffed' (i.e., 'flavored with alcohol'), or\n'savory and zestful'—perhaps all of these.  Forthwith the rest of\nthe list, with some cursory notes and explanations made in\nconsultation with the <em>OED</em>; with Partridge's <em>Dictionary of\nSlang and Unconventional English, Dictionary of the Underworld,\nSlang Today and Yesterday</em>, and <em>Name Into Word</em>; with\nWentworth and Flexner's <em>Dictionary of American Slang</em>; with\n<em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary (W3)</em>; and with\nBrewer's <em>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em>.</p>\n<p><em>abbess</em> ironic slang for 'brothel-keeper,' ca. 17th—19th\ncenturies; <em>obs</em>.</p>\n<p><em>abandoned woman</em> <em>abandoned</em> in the sense of 'self-abandoned,'\n'given over to vice'; <em>euphemism</em>.</p>\n<p><em>adventuress</em> also has a slightly broader meaning, 'a woman\nwho lives by questionable means.'</p>\n<p><em>bar-girl</em> see <em>B-girl</em>.</p>\n<p><em>bawd</em> [Middle English <em>bawde</em>, perh. fr.
