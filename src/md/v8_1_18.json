Herrick\n(1648) uses <em>garbage</em> and <em>carbage,</em> apparently for\n“shreds and patches used as padding.”  If this was\na genuine use at the time, <em>carbage</em> may easily\nhave been further corrupted to <em>cabbage</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cf. also Partridge 1970 (<em>Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional\nEnglish</em>), which adheres to the <em>garbage</em>\nhypothesis, and Partridge 1968 <em>(op. cit.),</em> which is silent\non the etymology of <em>cabbage</em>.</p>\n<p>But the origin of the two slang meanings of <em>cabbage</em>\ncan be found just by looking at the definitions of this\nword in Joseph Wright's <em>English Dialect Dictionary:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Shreds of cloth cut off by tailors in cutting out\nclothes, and appropriated by them; also larger\npieces purloined....</li>\n<li>To appropriate surreptitiously, to pilfer, rob.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wright also adds a 1755 quote: “Cabbage, whatever is\npurloined by taylors and mantua-women from the garments\nthey are to make up.”</p>\n<p>So the solution is simply that the shreds of cloth\nwere likened to shredded cabbage; and since these\nshreds (later, bigger ones too) were appropriated/filched\nby the tailors for their own use, <em>cabbage</em> came to mean\n'to steal, filch.'  Cf. also Farmer-Henley (under <em>cabbage</em>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... In America a corresponding term is COLDSLAW,\nwhich consists of finely-cut cabbage, and\nrepresents the small remnants known in other\nquarters as “carpet-rags” or CABBAGE.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But right after this illuminating statement Farmer-Henley\nadd, “The derivation is obscure,” and then tentatively\nadvance their suggestion of <em>cabbage</em> &lt; <em>garbage</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[Gerald Leonard Cohen, University of Missouri-Rolla].</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
