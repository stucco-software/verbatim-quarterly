In that letter I gave my own recollection of a popular satirical summary of the nicknames of England's newspapers and asked if other readers might be able to come up with more complete and accurate versions. Two readers have, in fact, responded, Ms. Diana May (Ickenhan, Middlesex) and Dr. John Kahn (Eton College). I think that other readers might be interested in a “new and improved” list. This list is an amalgamation of Ms. May's and Dr. Kahn's, which vary in some details but agree on the most important points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The Times</em> Read by the people who run the country.</p>\n<p><em>Daily Mail</em> Read by the wives of the people who run the country.</p>\n<p><em>Daily Mirror</em> Read by the people who think they run the country.</p>\n<p><em>Guardian</em> Read by the people who think they ought to run the country.</p>\n<p><em>Independent</em> Read by the people who think the people running the country are wrong.</p>\n<p><em>Financial Times</em> Read by the people who own the country.</p>\n<p><em>Today</em> Read by the people who think they own the country—and want to sell it.</p>\n<p><em>Morning Star</em> Read by the people who think the country should be run by another country.</p>\n<p><em>Daily Express</em> Read by the people who think the country ought to be run the way it used to be run.</p>\n<p><em>Daily Telegraph</em> Read by the people who think it still is.</p>\n<p><em>Sun</em> Read by the people who don't care who runs the bloody country providing she's got bit tits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*[Marc A.
