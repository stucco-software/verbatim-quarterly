This grammatical ambiguity\nis a frequent source of confusion, one cleverly exploited\nby those who write clues for crosswords.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5.  <em>Prices fear as oil shortage puts pressure on\nrefining.</em>  [Ibid., 11 October 90, p.31]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Prices</em> is an unusual noun to find in attrubutive position\nbefore a word like <em>fear</em> (in contrast to noun/verb\nambiguities like <em>drop, rise, increase, decline</em>, etc.).  In\nany event, it is still not clear why an oil shortage\nshould put pressure on refining (one would expect\nthe reverse) and why the prices resulting ought to\nrise (for <em>fear</em> would scarcely suggest 'reduction' except\nin a petroleum trade journal or oil company\nannual report).</p>\n<p>That is not to say that ambiguity is confined to\nheadlines.  In the following quotation, the reader\nmay have difficulty in determining how far from his\nwife this ideal husband lives, why he isn't bankrupt\nfrom feeding parking meters, and what circumstance\nmight have afflicted him with muteness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6.  “[Odette] lives in Walton-on-Thames with\nGeoffrey [Hallowes], a tall, courteous gentlemen\nretired from the wine business who\nseems content to write her letters, listen\nwhile she tells her stories, feed one's parking\nmeter, and altogether to be as attentive as a\nwife could wish.  [<em>The Sunday Times</em>, 14 October\n90:3:3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>",
