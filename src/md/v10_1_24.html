<p><em>Either</em> usually means 'one or the other,' so <em>Insert a washer
at either end of the axle</em> can easily mean '... at one end of the
axle or the other' rather than '... at each end.'  In constructions
like <em>the train had a baggage car at either end</em>, the ambiguity
becomes plain silliness.  Avoid this ambiguity by avoiding the
use of <em>either</em>: use either(!) <em>each</em>, or <em>both</em>, or <em>one or the other</em>,
depending on the meaning.</p>
