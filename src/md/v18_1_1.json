Appearances are often deceiving\nand this is a case in point.  The words are not\nunrelated and they have not been selected at random,\nfor they all have one thing very much in common,\nnamely, they are all Hindi loanwords.  To be\nsure, Hindi is not the ultimate source in all cases, but\nit was at least the final stopping point in the journey\nof the words into the English lexicon.  (In this article,\nHindi is used to cover loanwords which etymologists\nattribute to either Hindi or Urdu.  The two are\nbasically the same language, except that Hindi is\nwritten in Devanagari characters and Urdu in\nPersian-Arabic script.)  Hindi has, in fact, been a\nmore fruitful source of new words for the English\nlexicon than most people realize, a not unnatural result\nof the centuries of British rule in India.  All\nHindi loanwords in English, of course, are not as\nwell known or as frequently used as those listed\nabove; indeed, many are obscure in the extreme and\nare probably never used in speech or encountered in\nprint by the overwhelming majority of English\nspeakers.  Nonetheless, all are recognized by English\nlexicographers as being good English words.\nThus, all those cited in this article are to be found as\nseparate entries in <em>Webster's Third New International\nDictionary of the English Language</em>.</p>\n<p>Not all the words that English has borrowed\nfrom Hindi are pure Hindi; that is, some words\npassed through Hindi en route to English but their\nultimate origins lie elsewhere.  For example, out of a\nsampling of 481 Hindi loanwords (that is, I know, an\nodd number for a sampling of any kind, but it happens\nto be the number I had carded as of the moment\nI began writing this article), 167 were borrowed\nby Hindi from Sanskrit and another four from\nPakrit.  Persian was the ultimate source of 67 and\nArabic of 55 (the latter figure includes 16 words that\nentered Hindi via Persian and are combinations of\nArabic and Persian elements).  <em>Begum</em> 'high-ranking\nMuslim lady' derives ultimately from Eastern Turkic,\nwhile <em>cowrie</em> 'a type of sea shell' comes from Tamil\nor Malayalam <em>kavati</em> via Hindi <em>kauri</em> or <em>kaudi</em>.  Two\nHindi loanwords have their origin in Europe: <em>ayah</em>\n'native maid or nurse,' the Hindi version of Portuguese\n<em>aia</em>, and <em>pulton</em> or <em>pultun</em> 'infantry regiment,'\nadapted from <em>paltan</em>, the Hindi version of English\n<em>battalion</em>.</p>\n<p>Most Hindi loanwords entered English directly,\nbut a few first passed through the filter of another\nlanguage.  <em>Baiza</em> 'small copper coin of Oman,' for\nexample, is the Arabic version of Hindi <em>paisa</em>.  <em>Datura</em>\n'type of plant' and <em>vanda</em> 'variety of orchid'\nreached English via New Latin; <em>gavial</em> 'large crocodile,'\nfrom Hindi <em>ghariyal</em>) via French; and <em>mohar</em>\n'silver coin of Nepal' via Nepalese.  Portuguese was\nthe immediate source of four words (the Portuguese,\nit will be recalled, were also in India for several centuries,\nlosing their colony of Goa only in December\n1961): <em>copra</em>, from Hindi <em>khopra</em> via Malayalam <em>koppara;\nmachila</em> or <em>machilla</em> 'hammock slung from a\npole,' from Hindi <em>manzil</em> (borrowed unchanged from\nArabic) via Tamil <em>macil</em> or <em>mancil; tael</em> 'unit of\nweight,' from Hindi <em>tola</em> (adapted from Sanskrit <em>tula</em>)\nvia Malay <em>tahil</em>; and jambolan 'Java plum,' the English\nversion of Portuguese <em>jambulao</em>, from Hindi\n<em>jambul</em>.</p>\n<p>Some of the words in my sampling may or may\nnot be Hindi loanwords; that is, etymologists are uncertain\nwhether they are properly attributable to\nHindi or some other language of the subcontinent.\n<em>Dhoni</em> or <em>doni</em> 'fishing or coastal trading vessel,' for\nexample, may have entered English from Hindi, Marathi,\nKanarese (or Canarese), or Telugu; <em>dinghy</em>\n'small boat' from Hindi or Bengali; <em>kathiawari</em> 'breed\nof horses' from Hindi or Gujurati; <em>khuskhus</em> 'aromatic\ngrass, vetiver' from Hindi or Persian; <em>kirpan</em>\n'Sikh dagger' from Hindi or Punjabi; and <em>nagkasser</em>\nor <em>nagkesar</em> 'tree'. <em>patel</em> 'village headman' and\n<em>pindari</em> '18th-century mercenary,' from Hindi or Marathi.</p>\n<p>Several of the loanwords in my sampling are actually\nhybrids; that is, they include elements both\nfrom Hindi and from one or more other languages.\n<em>Memsahib</em> 'term of respect for a European lady,' for\nexample, derives from English <em>ma'am</em> and Hindi <em>sahib</em>\n'sir, master,' a word borrowed by Hindi from\nArabic; <em>boxwallah</em> 'peddler' combines English <em>box</em>\nand Hindi <em>wallah</em> 'person in charge of a particular\nthing'; <em>chotapeg</em> 'half-sized drink' unites Hindi <em>chota</em>\n'little, small' and English <em>peg</em> (Anglo-Indian slang\nsince at least 1864 for a drink, especially of brandy\nand soda water); and <em>shroffage</em> 'commission charged\nfor shroffing' combines <em>shroff</em> (an adaptation of Hindi\n<em>saraf</em> 'banker, money-lender,' a word borrowed from\nArabic) and the English suffix -<em>age</em>.  Combinations of\nHindi and Persian elements include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a) <em>balaghat</em> 'tableland above a mountain pass,'\nfrom Persian <em>bala</em> 'above' and Hindi ghat 'pass;\npassage or stairway descending to a river';</p>\n<p>b) <em>bhumidar</em> 'landowner having full title,' from\nHindi <em>bhumi</em> 'earth, land' and Persian <em>dar</em>\n'holder';</p>\n<p>c) <em>chokidar</em> 'watchman,' from Hindi <em>cauki</em> 'police\nstation' and Persian <em>dar</em>; and</p>\n<p>d) <em>kalaazar</em> 'disease also known as dumdum fever,'\nfrom Hindi <em>kala</em> 'black' and Persian <em>azar</em>\n'disease.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Mussalchee</em> 'torchbearer' combines <em>mussal</em> 'torch,\nusually of oilsoaked rags,' adapted from Hindi <em>masal</em>\nor <em>mashal</em>, the Hindi version of Arabic <em>mash'al</em>, and\nTurkic -<em>ci</em> (or <em>chi, ji</em>), a suffix denoting an agent.</p>\n<p>Many Hindi loanwords are simply transliterations\nof the Hindi originals.  But since different individuals\nhave different ideas about how the Devanagari\nand Arabic alphabets should be transliterated,\nin many cases there is no single “correct” way to\nspell a specific word and, instead, dictionaries offer\nseveral—sometimes as many as six—acceptable variant\nspellings.  <em>Burka</em> 'loose woman's garment covering\nentire body,' for example, can also be spelled\n<em>bourka, burkha, burga, burqa</em>, or <em>bourkha</em>, while <em>mahua</em>\n'type of tree' can also be spelled <em>mahwa</em>,\n<em>mohwa, mowha, mowra</em>, or <em>mowrah</em>.  Loanwords\nwith five recognized spellings include: <em>chador,\nchadar, chuddar, chudder, chaddar</em> 'woman's cloth\nhead covering'; <em>mahseer, mahsir, mahsur, mahaseer,\nmahasir</em> 'freshwater fish'; <em>mali, mallee, mallie, mally,\nmolly</em> 'member of a gardening caste'; <em>naik, naig,\nnaique, naigue, nayak</em> 'leader, corporal'; and <em>tussah,\ntusseh, tusser, tussor, tussur</em> 'tan silk; also the silkworm\nproducing it.' <em>Chukker</em> 'period of polo play,'\n<em>dhoti</em> 'loincloth,' <em>dinghy, ganja</em> 'cannabis used for\nsmoking,' <em>khidmatgar</em> 'male waiter,' <em>khuskhus,\nkutcha</em> 'crude, imperfect,' <em>myna</em> 'species of bird,'\n<em>puggaree</em> 'blight turban, scarf,' <em>raggee</em> 'finger millet,'\n<em>ryotwar</em> 'system of collecting land rents or taxes,'\n<em>sambar</em> 'type of deer,' and <em>zamindari</em> 'system of land\nholding' each have three other acceptable spellings.\nMy sampling contains about fifty other words that\nhave either two or three variant spellings each.</p>\n<p>Although most loanwords differ in form somewhat\nfrom their Hindi antecedents, the changes are\nlargely minor orthographic ones, as the substitution\nof <em>ch, gh</em>, and <em>sh</em> for an original <em>c, g</em>, or <em>s</em>, etc.  Thus,\nEnglish has <em>champac</em> 'tree' instead of <em>campak, gharry</em>\n'horse-drawn cab or carriage' instead of <em>gari, darshan</em>\n'a Hindu blessing' instead of <em>darsan</em>.  A change\nof vowels or a doubling of a consonant is also not\ninfrequent, thus giving English <em>kunkur</em> 'variety of\nlimestone' in lieu of <em>kankar, mulmul</em> 'muslin' in lieu\nof <em>malmal, muggar</em> 'kind of crocodile' in lieu of\n<em>magar</em>.  Dozens of similar examples could be cited.\nOn the other hand, some loanwords have undergone\nradical changes.  Few individuals, I hazard, would be\nlikely, upon seeing the Hindi terms <em>bilayati, bajara,\nbajra, kaawch, pani</em>, and <em>rasaut</em>, to cite only a few, to\ndiscern therein the English <em>blighty</em> Anglo-Indian\nslang for 'England as home,' <em>brinjarry</em> 'traveling\ngrain and salt dealer,' <em>budgerow</em> 'large, keelless\nbarge,' <em>cowage</em> 'tropical vine,' <em>pawnee</em> 'water' and\n<em>rusot</em> 'plant extract.'  Two other good examples are\n<em>Juggernaut</em> 'unstoppable destructive force: or object,'\nwhich derives from <em>jagannath</em>, and <em>kedgeree</em>\n'cooked dish of rice, lentils, and spices,' which derives\nfrom <em>khicri</em> or <em>khicari</em>.  The familiar <em>cot</em> and\n<em>dungaree</em> are close to their Hindi predecessors in\npronunciation, though not in spelling; they derive,\nrespectively, from <em>khat</em> and <em>dungri</em>.</p>\n<p>In the case of some loanwords, there has been a\nchange in both form and meaning.  <em>Bandanna</em>, for\nexample, comes from <em>bandhu</em>, which denotes a way\nof dyeing cloth, while <em>bungalow</em> comes from <em>bangla</em>,\nan adjective meaning 'of Bengal.'  Other loanwords\nwhich have acquired changed meanings include <em>chitra</em>\n'axis deer,' from <em>citra</em> 'spotted'; <em>hathi</em> 'gray,' from\n<em>hathi</em> 'elephant'; <em>pukka</em> 'genuine, reliable, good,'\nfrom <em>pakka</em> 'cooked, ripe, mature'; <em>puttee</em> 'soldier's\nlegging,' from <em>patti</em> 'bandage'; <em>pyke</em> 'civilian at\nwhose expense a soldier is treated,' from <em>payik</em> 'messenger';\nand <em>toddy</em> 'type of hot drink,' from <em>tari</em> 'palmyra\npalm juice.'  These are only a few of the many\nexamples available.</p>\n<p>Some single Hindi words have given rise to two\ndifferent loanwords.  <em>Bandar</em> 'rhesus monkey' and\n<em>bondar</em> 'palm civet,' for example, both derive from\n<em>bada</em> or <em>badar</em> 'monkey,' while <em>baniya</em> 'merchant' is\nthe Hindi antecedent of both banyan 'tree' and <em>bunnia</em>\n'member of a merchant caste.'  Other examples\nof the same phenomenon include: <em>chokey</em> 'customs\nstation' and <em>chowk</em> 'marketplace,' from <em>cauki</em> 'marketplace';\n<em>mulmul</em> (see above) and <em>mull</em> 'soft thin\nmuslin,' from <em>malmal</em> (see above); <em>pandit</em> 'scholar;\nman held in high respect' and <em>pundit</em> 'very learned;\nauthoritative commentator,' from <em>pandit</em> 'wise,\nlearned'; and <em>numdah</em> 'thick felt rug' and <em>numnah</em>\n'felt or sheepskin saddle pad,' from <em>namda</em> 'carpet,\nrug.'  Again, numerous other examples could be\ncited.</p>\n<p>As the examples cited above make clear, Hindi\nloanwords in English relate to a wide variety of subjects.\nMy sampling also includes the following\nwords in the indicated subject categories (words already\ncited are not repeated):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Animals: <em>balisaur, barasingh, bhalu, bharal, chikara,\nchital, gaur, hanuman, jumnapari, kakar,\nkastura, langur, nilgai, rusa, tangun, tattoo</em></p>\n<p>Birds: <em>baya, chukar, hurgila, jermonal, sarus, shama</em></p>\n<p>Buildings: <em>chawl, gola, gunge, mandir, tope</em></p>\n<p>Caste/religious terms: <em>balahi, bhagat, bhangi, bhat,\nbhora, chamar, chhatri, chuhra, churel, gadaria,\ngoala, granthi, jajman, kahar, kalwar, khatri,\nkumbh mala, kumhar, kumkum, kurmi, math,\nmela, nai, Nanakpanthi, pardhan, Rajput,\nsamadh, samaj, sangh</em></p>\n<p>Clothing: <em>bursati, kambal, sari, sherwani</em></p>\n<p>Coins: <em>anna, pice, rupee</em></p>\n<p>Drugs/chemicals: <em>bikh, chandu, charas, goracco,\nkaraya, khair, kutira gum, lac, munjeet,\npassewa, reh</em></p>\n<p>Fabrics: <em>jaconet, khaddar, nainsook, pattu, tat</em></p>\n<p>Fish/marine life: <em>ghol, goonch, hilsa, rohu</em></p>\n<p>Foods/beverages: <em>chapati, chotahazri, dahi, ghee,\njaggery, khoa, puri</em></p>\n<p>Governmental/legal terms: <em>batta, begar, chaprasi,\ndakoit, dakoity, dhan, dharna, kotwal, kotwali,\npanchayat, pottah, sabha</em></p>\n<p>Household items: <em>bidri, chagul, chatta, chowrie,\nchulha, dhurrie, gaddi, kangri, lota, phulkari,\npitarah, punkah, teapoy</em></p>\n<p>Insects: <em>khapra</em></p>\n<p>Measures: <em>bigha, crore, lac, maund, ruttee, ser,\ntank, tola, yojan</em></p>\n<p>Military/weapons: <em>kukri, kuttar, sangar, thana</em></p>\n<p>Musical instruments: <em>bin, narsinga, pungi, sarinda,\nsitar</em></p>\n<p>Occupations: <em>bapu, chokra, dhai, dhobi,\ngharrywallah, madrasi, mahajan, mahout,\npuggy</em></p>\n<p>Plants: <em>ber, bhabar, bhang, chirata, dhal, gulancha,\nhursinghar, jarool, jowar, kans, khesari, kusa,\nmaloo, mand, mesta, mudar, munj, pan, rosha,\nsarson, til, urd</em></p>\n<p>Snakes: <em>baboia</em></p>\n<p>Titles: <em>babu, bhai, burra, maharajah, maharani,\nrajah, rajpramukh, rani</em></p>\n<p>Transport vehicles/boats: <em>dak, dandy, morpunky,\npalkee, pulwar, putelee, tonga</em></p>\n<p>Trees/shrubs: <em>bahera, bel, bendy, caraunda, dhak,\ndhaman, dhauri, dhawa, haldu, jaman, jambo,\njambos, jambool, kapur, karela, kathal, kikar,\nkokan, neem, palas, pipal, sal, salai, sunn, susco,\ntoon</em></p>\n<p>Miscellaneous: <em>abir, amla, bandarlog, banghy, bat,\nbhadan, bhoosa, bhut, bidi, bock, bukh, chee-chee,\nchopper, churrus, ghurry, goonda, hartal,\nHoli, hundi, jheel, jungli, kaithi, kartik, keddah,\nmachan, nautch, nullah, pachisi, piuri, paig,\npurree</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above do not include those loanwords deriving\nfrom words earlier borrowed by Hindi from\nPersian and Arabic, which are (in addition to those\nalready cited):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From Persian:</p>\n<p>Clothing: <em>jama, rumal</em></p>\n<p>Fabrics: <em>kincob</em></p>\n<p>Governmental terms: <em>daroga, dewan, durbar,\nparganna, peshwa, purwannah, russud,\nsheristadar, zamindar</em></p>\n<p>Household items: <em>charpoy, chillumchee, rezai</em></p>\n<p>Islamic terms: <em>khaksar, khankah, pir, purdah</em></p>\n<p>Legal terms: <em>benami, dastur</em></p>\n<p>Military: <em>sepoy, subahdar</em></p>\n<p>Occupations: <em>begari, bheesty, bildar, bobachee,\nchakar, chobdar, darzi, khansamah, mazdoor,\nphansigar, rahdar, shikari</em></p>\n<p>Titles: <em>akhundzada, bahadur, shahzada, sirdar</em></p>\n<p>Miscellaneous: <em>bas, bazigar, buckshee, bund,\ncharka, chawbuck, cillum, dasturi, gunge,\nkajawah, koftgari, koomkie, sarod, shikar,\nshikargah, shikra, tabasheer</em></p>\n<p>From Arabic:</p>\n<p>Government terms: <em>abwab, hookum, jumma, malik,\nmofussil, munshi, munsif, musnud, nabob,\nnawab, nizam, omrah, tahsil, taluk</em></p>\n<p>Military: <em>maidan, nazim</em></p>\n<p>Occupations: <em>mutsuddy, syce, vakeel</em></p>\n<p>Plants: <em>gingelly</em></p>\n<p>Religious terms: <em>fatwa, khalsa, mazhabi, minah</em></p>\n<p>Miscellaneous: <em>baba, howdah, izzat, khalat, kharif,\nmajoon, nuzzer, rabi, shrab</em></p>\n<p>From Arabic via Persian or Arabic-Persian\ncombinations:</p>\n<p>Government terms: <em>burkundaz, daftardar, faujdar,\nfaujdary, malguzar, malikana, nazir, tahsildar</em></p>\n<p>Military: <em>dafadar, havildar, jemandar, risala,\nrisaldar</em></p>\n<p>Religious terms: <em>shahidi</em></p>\n<p>Miscellaneous: <em>halalior</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>",
