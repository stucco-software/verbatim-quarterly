Y. Times</em>, may agree with me in the contention\nthat when he writes about language he seems to\nbe writing on his day off: I cannot put my finger on\nwhy, but “On Language” always strikes me as an excruciating\neffort to be cute.  In part, that is attributable\nto the designation of his correspondents, who\nkeep him informed on language that is not within\nearshot, as the “Lexicographic Irregulars,” an amusing\nreference the first time or two it was used but now\nbeginning to cloy.  More often than it might prove of\ninterest to me, personally, Safire deals with insiders'\nlanguage in Washington (where he is based) or with\ntrivialities uttered by some politico.</p>\n<p>As Andrew Norman wrote, in a letter published in\nthis book on page 113, “You flit freely back and forth\nbetween prescriptivism and descriptivism.”  But are not\nmany of us guilty of that?  We are descriptive of the\nusages we accept and prescriptive—perhaps proscriptive\nwould be more descriptive—of those we do not\nlike.  At least Safire expresses an opinion; whether the\nreader agrees with him is another matter, as are the\nquestions of his accuracy, which arise fairly often, and\nthat of the suitability of his style, which, as far as I\nknow, has not been broached before.  It ill behooves\nme, excoriated recently as enamored of the “cheap\nlarf,” to criticize Safire's arch puns, which permeate—“enliven”\nis probably the word his editor would\nuse—his articles, but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable\nfor reading, however they might evoke a\nchuckle when uttered <em>viva voce</em>.  A handful of examples,\nfrom the book at hand:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, I stand uncorrected. [p. 112]</p>\n<p>...“Get your hand off my knee.”  (That's a mnemonic,\npronounced <em>knee-MONIC</em>.)</p>\n<p>Ize Right?  [title, p. 114]</p>\n<p>Juggernaughty but Nice [title, p. 115]</p>\n<p>...slanguist...[p. 116]</p>\n<p>Lex Appeal [title, p. 121]</p>\n<p>Logue-Rolling [title, p. 123]</p>\n<p>[on <em>-logue vs. -log</em>:] Some people prefer their\n<em>logues</em> sawed off...[p. 123]</p>\n<p>But the Library of Congress wants to be non-U [in\nits spelling of <em>-logue</em> words].  [ibid.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Writing containing such labored figures makes for\nhard reading.  I am interested in what Safire has to say\nabout language but find myself stymied: I get the feeling\nthat he has deliberately created a minefield of\ninterruptions in thought through which I must pick\nmy way to the end.  Notwithstanding the valuable role\nhe plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language\nand in informing them about myriad facets of\nthe subject, I find it hard slogging (or, as he would\nprobably write, “sloguing”).</p>\n<p><em>You Could Look It Up</em> is the umpteenth collection\nof Safire's columns and, like the previous collections,\ncontains a selection of letters from readers.  It is those\nthat are so sorely missed in his column.  True, there is\nan occasional mention in his column of a point raised\nby a correspondent, and the Letters section of the\n<em>Magazine</em> prints a comment from time to time, but an\nimportant feature of the books is their inclusion of far\nmore writer-reader interaction than one might suspect\nfrom reading the column alone.  For one thing, the\nletter-writers call attention to errors or misinterpretations\nand are largely critical.  Safire cannot be accused\nof being copy-proud (except, evidently, of awful puns,\nas in “<em>Ms.</em> is deliberately <em>msterious</em>, but at least it is\nnot deliberately <em>msleading</em>” and other mscegenations).</p>\n<p>There is no gainsaying that Safire is one of the\nmost influential writers on contemporary English, and\nit is essential that his books be in the libraries of all\nwho are interested in the subject, regardless of their\nalignment with his opinions.  For one thing, he documents\nmany neologisms, an activity that endears him\nto many working lexicographers.  From the sometimes\ncavalier manner in which he treats his subject, one\nwonders if Safire feels the burden of the responsibility\nhe has toward his readers.</p>\n<p>The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from\nwhich this review was prepared; unfortunately, there\nwas no proof of an index, but the publisher has assured\nme that there will be one in the published book, a\nrather essential ingredient of a work with this title.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
