Yet they were wrapped up in peculiar\nclose-fitting cloaks or blankets.  They came from the\nsea, from enormous floating objects, were of indeterminate\ngender, and were as pale as if they were returning\nfrom the dead.

It was a convenient fiction among themselves\nthat the land had no previous owner, a fiction still\nchallenged two hundred years later in a call for <em>land\nrights</em>.</p>\n<p>The elders among the newcomers were well-meaning.\nThey brought what they felt to be a superior\nreligion and a superior civilization.  It was not immediately\nobvious to the local people why working most of\nthe day was better than hunting for a few hours a\nweek, and the intricacies of personal ownership sometimes\neluded them, as, indeed, they had eluded many\nof the newcomers who owed their passage out to that\nvery shortcoming.  Nevertheless there was some exchange\nof learning.  The local people learned that the\nbig-eared ones that made terrifying noises at night\nwere called <em>cows</em> and the snorting ones <em>horses</em>, and\nthey knew that the man with the gun was inseparable\nfrom the horse.  More familiar animals were now\ncalled <em>kangaroos</em> since the newcomers seemed to think\nthat this would be the native name in Sydney, as it was\nfarther north.  Sometimes the local people made their\nown names for the new animals; rabbits were '<em>stand-up\nears</em>,' sheep '<em>soft feet</em>.'  Horses were named '<em>white\nman's kangaroo</em>' (in the Adelaide region) or <em>yarraman</em>\nwhich seems to mean 'long teeth.'  European food was\nnamed too: rice was called 'white man's maggots.'</p>\n<p>The newcomers began to learn the names of Australian\nanimals, plants, weapons, and other things\nfrom the first people they met, the natives of the Sydney\narea, so that many Aboriginal words in English\nare from this region.  The <em>koala</em> (for a long time called\n<em>native bear</em>), the <em>dingo</em>, the <em>wallaroo</em> (a large brownish-black\nkangaroo), the <em>wallaby</em> (a small kangaroo),\n<em>waratah</em> (a red-flowering tree or shrub, the floral emblem\nof New South Wales), <em>boomerang, waddy</em> (a club\nor stick, possibly a Pidgin word from English <em>wood),\ncooee</em> (a call to attract attention from a distance), and\n<em>corroboree</em> (Aboriginal singing and dancing), appear\nto have this origin.  Sometimes, as with <em>galah</em> or <em>kookaburra</em>,\nnames of noisy birds, it is not easy to determine\na source language as several languages provide a plausible\nsource but perhaps reflect onomatopoeic names\nindependently arrived at.</p>\n<p>Some Aboriginal people accepted invitations to\ncloser relations with the newcomers.  One named Bennelong\nlived for a time with the Governor and later,\nwearing the clothing of a British officer, lived in a hut\nat what is now Bennelong Point, where the Sydney\nOpera House now stands.  A few miles to the north at\nParramatta, Captain Watkin Tench of the Marines encountered\na native whose name he recorded as Yel-lo-mun-dee\n(with the stress on the first syllable).  This\npresumably explains the oddly named <em>Yellow Monday\nCreek</em> and thence the names of the cicadas <em>yellow\nMonday</em> and (in imitation of it, we may presume)\n<em>green Monday</em>, also known as <em>greengrocer</em>.  The plethora\nof popular names for kinds of cicadas (others are\n<em>floury miller, double drummer</em>, and <em>cherry nose</em>, also\nknown as <em>whisky drinker</em>) is explained by the popularity\nof collecting cicadas among boys, especially round\nSydney.</p>\n<p>Opera lovers and boys who collect cicadas commemorate\nthe names of Bennelong and Yel-lo-mun-dee,\nbut this beginning did not lead to fruitful cultural\nexchange.  Towards the end of the nineteenth century,\nnationalism promoted native names such as <em>koala</em> and\n<em>kookaburra</em> rather than <em>native bear</em> and <em>laughing jackass</em>,\nand in the early twentieth century the <em>Jindy-worobak</em>\nmovement in poetry encouraged Aboriginal\nthemes.  But there is not really much to show for two\nhundred years of sharing a land.  It is not surprising\nthat many Aboriginal people see little cause to celebrate\na much-publicized bicentenary of an intrusion\ninto their land.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
