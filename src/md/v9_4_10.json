Among them he drew\nattention to one large category, those French words adopted in\nEnglish in the past whose meanings have evolved along\ndifferent lines in each country.  Alongside them is another\ninteresting group, English and French words of common origin\nwhich, as well as a change of meaning, have undergone a\nchange of form, usually in English, and now look so different\nthat they are unlikely to deceive.</p>\n<p>One way of demonstrating how widely words in both\nthese categories can differ in sense from their counterparts in\nthe other language is to put together a bit of prose where some\nof the English ones are used as if they had the meaning, or one\nof the meanings, of their French doublets.  The result is\nnonsense, as these paragraphs illustrate:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the fine of a long journey Joe left the counter of\nthe National Bank where he had been implied for\nthirty years.  The travel was dull but his appointments\nwere fair.  As usual at the hour of affluence the going\nwas slow.</p>\n<p>On his way home he visited his wife who was still in\nhospital after a bad rut accident: both her legs were\nstill in slices.  She was as pale as the drabs.  Even before\nthe crash she had lost a lot of her slat: her eyes no\nlonger stenciled as they used to some twenty years\nbefore at the tense when they walked down the alley\ntogether.  There was no chance of a quick garrison but\nshe was happy to scout music from her portable post\nand he did not stay long, leaving her the journal he\nhad brought in his serviette.</p>\n<p>At home he found his son Stan in the saloon with\nhis usual friends—young men of the gender Joe disliked\nmost.  Stan was a disappointment.  He had always been\nlazy and sturdy, he never ranged his habits and affairs,\nthey always trained all over the place.  His room was a\nvery equerry.  At school his notes were always bad, he\nwas frequently consigned.  Not surprising that recently\nhe had once more got nowhere in a concourse.  His\nfriends were as bad: a cigarette had broiled the edge of\nthe card table, there was a dark tack on the carpet\nwhere a glass of drink had fallen.  The cashiered morsels\nhad been carelessly pushed in a corner.</p>\n<p>Joe watched his son toil the cards, deal and then\nattempt the contract.  What he clearly ought to do was\nto play his quarrels first and his father groaned\ninwardly as the boy chose pikes instead.  Now he was\nbound to be a ply or two light.</p>\n<p>Feeling hungry Joe made his way to the cuisine to\nsee what was in the placard.  It had to be a sandwich:\nhe spread a couch of butter on some bread he found\nin the hutch and coped some cheese while he chafed\nsome coffee.  All the while he pondered why nothing\nmarched for him.  He never had any vein, never\nachieved what he set out to do.  When he had gone in\nfor swimming, he had never arrived to do even the\nbrace.  Despite his post any actions he acquired soon\nlost valor.  He sometimes thought he would buy a campaign\npropriety, run a smallholding.  Then he repealed\nhimself that when he basted some mews to keep pools\nthe wind abated them in one night.</p>\n<p>Lost in these sad souvenirs he noticed too late that\nthe coffee was boiling.  As he snatched up the casserole\nthe queue came off in his hand and he watched some\nof the liquid spawn itself over his trenches of cheese\nwhile the rest soaked into his chemise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To restore sanity to this text all that is needed is to\nsubstitute for the incomprehensible English words the translations\nof their French doublets, listed in the

you get the hang of this <em>jeu de mots</em> you can play it\nin reverse by writing a bit of French in which some words are\nused as if they had the meaning of their English doublets and\nso make no sense in the context.  Then, for greater enjoyment\nof the result, translate it, literally, into English.  Alternatively\nwrite a piece of English which is nonsense because it uses the\ntranslations of some French doublets and get your friends to\nwork out which English words you have disguised.  All this does\nwonders to your vocabulary—in both languages.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
