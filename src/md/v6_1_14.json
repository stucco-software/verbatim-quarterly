When one includes among the <em>parameters</em>\nof life elements such as cultural background, genetic\nstructure, or temperament, it's not a good metaphor.  Life's\nproblem (which the young confuse with what they consider a\nsearch for identity) is to locate the true <em>parameters</em>, things\nthat can be changed (education might be one) and might lead\nto a more rounded life.  <em>Parameters</em> are not fixed limits but dimensions\nwhich can be changed by the perpetrator.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For whatso'er we perpetrate,</p>\n<p>We do but row, we're steered by fate.</p>\n<p>—Samuel Butler, <em>Hudibras</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2></h2>",
