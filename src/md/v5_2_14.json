Walter Wilson, M.D., Los Alamitos, California</em></p>\n<p>I have before me a small tan-colored book of poems published\nby Strickland Gillilan in 1917 entitled <em>Including Finnegan</em>.\nThe fly leaf is inscribed “To J. Walter Wilson with the\nundying regard of a regular feller who knows another regular\nfeller thoroughly but loves him still; also when he isn't still.”\nThis was inscribed to my father who was his companion on\nseveral vaudeville circuits.</p>\n<p>Gillilan's name is virtually unknown, but he should be\nforever remembered because the Finnegan poem added to the\nEnglish language the phrase <em>off again, on again</em>, which most\nof us hear and use frequently in the mistaken belief that it refers\nto something or someone who changes direction rapidly\nand often.  In fact, it refers to the thousands of persons who fled\nfrom Ireland's potato famine in the 1840s, whose men almost\nalways became policemen or railroad workers.  Thus it is an\nold railroad story.  It is written in one of the more difficult\nrhyming styles and contains the longest succession of trisyllabic\nrhymes I have ever encountered.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finnigin to Flannigan</p>\n<p>Superintindint wuz Flannigan;<br>\nBoss av th' siction wuz Finnigin.<br>\nWhiniver th' cyars got off th' thrack<br>\nAn' muddled up things t' th' divvle an' back,<br>\nFinnigin writ it t' Flannigan,<br>\nAfther th' wrick wuz all on agin;<br>\nThat is, this Finnigin<br>\nRepoorted t' Flannigan.</p>\n<p>Whin Finnigin furrst writ t' Flannigan,<br>\nHe writed tin pa-ages, did Finnigin;<br>\nAn' he towld just how th' wrick occurred—<br>\nYis, minny a tajus, blundherin' wurrd<br>\nDid Finnigin write t' Flannigan<br>\nAfther the' cyars had gone on agin—<br>\nThat's th' way Finnigin<br>\nRepoorted t' Flannigan.</p>\n<p>Now Flannigan knowed more than Finnigin—<br>\nHe'd more idjucation, had Flannigan.<br>\nAn' ut wore 'm clane an' complately out</p>\n<p>T” tell what Finnigin writ about<br>\nIn 's writin' t' Musther Flannigan.<br>\nSo he writed this back.  “Musther Finnigin:—<br>\nDon't do sich a sin agin;<br>\nMake 'em brief, Finnigin!”</p>\n<p>Whin Finnigin got that frum Flannigan<br>\nHe blushed rosy-rid, did Finnigin.<br>\nAn' he said: “I'll gamble a whole month's pay<br>\nThat ut'll be minny an' minny a day<br>\nBefure sup'rintindint—that's Flannigan—<br>\nGits a whack at that very same sin agin.<br>\nFrum Finnigin to Flannigan<br>\nRepoorts won't be long agin.”</p>\n<p>Wan day on th' siction av Finnigin,<br>\nOn th' road sup'rintinded be Flannigan,<br>\nA ra-ail give way on a bit av a currve<br>\nAn' some cyars wint off as they made th' shwarrve.<br>\n“They's nobody hurrted,” says Finnigin,<br>\n“But repoorts must be made t' Flannigan.”<br>\nAn' he winked at McGorrigan<br>\nAs married a Finnigin.</p>\n<p>He wuz shantyin' thin, wuz Finnigin,<br>\nAs minny a railroader's been agin,<br>\nAn' 'is shmoky ol' lamp wuz burrnin' bright<br>\nIn Finnigin' shanty all that night—<br>\nBilin' down 's repoort, wuz Finnigin.<br>\nAn' he writed this here: “Musther Flannigan:—<br>\nOff agin, on agin,<br>\nGone agin.—Finnigin.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>",
