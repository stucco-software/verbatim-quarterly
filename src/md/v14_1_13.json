Among those\nin current use are the <em>C word for commitment</em>, the <em>M\nword</em> for <em>marriage</em>, the <em>Y word</em> for <em>Yuppie</em>, as well as\nthe familiar <em>F word</em>.

Four-letter\nwords are normally restricted by taboo.</p>\n<p>Perhaps anthropological linguists should take note\nof the increased range of meanings that the one-letter\nwords allude to.  Avoidance of such words as <em>marriage</em>\nand <em>commitment</em> is scarcely trivial.  Marriage, according\nto cultural anthropologists, is a cultural universal\nwhich societies past and present have honored and\nprotected.  Why now the <em>M word</em>?  A few social scientists\nare suggesting that the basic social unit in our\nculture will soon be the single person, not the family.\nThe substitution of the <em>M word</em> suggests that they may\nbe right.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
