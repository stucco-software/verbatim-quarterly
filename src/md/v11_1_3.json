Many of his\nstories were written in the form of monologues in which he let\nhis characters speak and in which he portrayed himself as the\nverbatim chronicler, a device which allowed him to “record”\ndirectly the way his people spoke.  Not infrequently the speakers\nin these stories would familiarly address themselves to the\nwriter, for instance, “You know, Mr. Sholem Aleichem ...” but\nnever, ever was he addressed in these stories as “Mr.\nAleichem”—that is, never did Sholem Aleichem “address”\nhimself in his own writing, through his characters, as “Mr.\nAleichem.”  This was simply unimaginable because, as I\ndescribed in my above-cited paper, both the literal and symbolic\nmeanings and nuances of the compound pen name do not\nadmit such truncation.</p>\n<p><em>[Zellig Bach, Lakehurst, New Jersey]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
