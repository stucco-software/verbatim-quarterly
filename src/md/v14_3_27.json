If that was the situation, it is quite as remarkable\nas the putative British-American antonym, for it\ndemonstrates two things: (1) the passion for making\nsense that leads us to remodel what we hear into what\nwe think should have been said and (2) the process of\ndialect clash, one of whose effects is to force speakers\nto reevaluate their options and thus to keep language\nvariation within acceptable limits.</p>\n<p><em>[John Algeo, University of Georgia]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
