Collecting lists of silliness is a legitimate pastime. I collect matchbooks and names that end in -<em>ford</em>. My collections are completely without academic merit but they amuse me. To compare the collectors of Wellerisms to brick-wall comedians is to overlook a generational, if not historical and unfortunate shift in humor. Men of my grandpa's era and earlier were amused by the subtle, the slapstick, and the silly. Men of my generation and younger are amused by the sewer. Can you imagine the hard-edged rappers of today being tickled by the lyrics of <em>Mairzy Doats?</em> My dad's earnest question, “do you walk to school or carry your lunch?” was so utterly lame, so naive, but such romps in the playgrounds of language are never tripe.</p>\n<p><em>[Lisa A.
