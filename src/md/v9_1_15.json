Turner</span> <span data-rel=\"location\"></span></em></p>\n<p>Some words die out of a language as the last speakers to\nuse them pass away, but others don't wait for that and\ndisappear from the memory as occasion to use them becomes\nless and less frequent.  I was reminded of this and of a\nforgotten name when I read the other day that on Cape Barren\nIsland, off the north coast of Tasmania, a local form of English\npreserves the term <em>morning wood</em> for 'kindling.'  It brought\nback a world of an iron range and wood fires lit first thing in\nthe morning on a New Zealand farm half a century ago.  We\nused morning wood.  Cape Barren Islanders also go <em>out on the\nrangtang</em> ('out on a spree,' though where they find one on that\ntiny island I don't know), and this too recalls New Zealand\nidiom, where <em>out on the rantan</em> survives (or did when I left the\ncountry seventeen years ago) along with other old-fashioned\ncolloquialisms like <em>go to market</em> or <em>kick up bobsie-die</em> (etymologically\n'bob's a-dying'), both meaning 'make a fuss.'</p>\n<p>These are old-fashioned in that they have elsewhere died\nout of the common language, and they are old-fashioned to me\nbecause of their association with bygone days.  Sometimes such\nwords survive on the periphery of an innovative area: New\nZealand (at least formerly) and Queensland retain <em>duchesse</em> for\na 'dressing table with a swing mirror'; the same two areas use\n<em>Hooray</em> as a farewell greeting.  But perhaps to readers abroad\nthe faintly rustic New Zealand popular idiom will have a\nfreshness; the kiwi's attempt to fly might to them seem less\nstumbling.  It may amuse some to find <em>thingummy</em> replaced by\n<em>doodackie</em>, to hear a sausage called a <em>snarler</em> or to hear <em>he did\nhis bun</em> for 'he was angry'.</p>\n<p>There is an arbitrariness in slang just as in more formal\nlanguage.  Just as what some call a <em>cattlegrid</em> is to others (in\nparts of Australia) a <em>cattleramp</em> or <em>cattlepit</em> or (in the U.S.) a\n<em>cattleguard</em> or (in New Zealand) a <em>cattlestop</em>, so what Americans\ncall a <em>derby</em> (hat) and the British call a <em>bowler hat</em> used to\nbe slangily a <em>boxer</em> in Australia and a <em>bun hat</em> or <em>hardhitter</em> in\nNew Zealand, and a minor ailment going around is a <em>wog</em> in\nAustralia and a <em>bot</em> in New Zealand.  New Zealand adds the\nfacetious greeting 'How are the bots biting?'</p>\n<p>The recently published <em>Macquarie Dictionary</em>, though\nclaiming to be primarily a dictionary of Australian English, is\nalso rich in New Zealandisms.  For me it brings back many\nfamiliar expressions, <em>in the dogbox</em> 'in disfavor,' <em>to be in donkey\ndeep</em> 'to be thoroughly involved,' <em>jack up</em> 'arrange, organize'\n(not, as in Australia, 'break down'), <em>the keg's cut</em> 'the beer has\nrun out' (I don't know whether '<em>s</em> means <em>is</em> or <em>has</em>), <em>rafferty</em>\n'rough, ragged,' <em>hokonui</em> 'illicit whiskey' (from the remote\nHokonui Hills), <em>fair do</em> an appeal for fair play equivalent to the\nAustralian's <em>fair go</em>, and <em>make a do of</em> (something) 'make a\nsuccess of' it.  As in any slang there are (or were) numerous\nwords meaning 'excellent': <em>snitcher, rube</em> (short for <em>rubydazzler</em>),\nor <em>corker</em>.  (I used <em>corker</em> as an adjective in a childhood\ndiary in 1933, antedating the <em>OED</em> by four years.)  Maori\nprovided a number of words, <em>taihoa</em> 'wait a bit,' <em>waipiro</em>\n'alcoholic drink' (literally 'stinking water'), <em>puku</em> 'belly,' and\n<em>puckeroo</em> 'break, damage' (Maori <em>pakaru</em>).  To break or damage\nin a grinding sort of way is to <em>graunch</em>, a word tending to\nreplace <em>puckeroo</em>, I think.</p>\n<p>New Zealand speech seems to be changing rapidly (even\nto me now in the pronunciation of the young New Zealander\n<em>learn</em> sounds like <em>loon</em> and <em>loon</em> is heading towards <em>lean</em>), so\nthat it is not surprising that I am unfamiliar with some items\nnoted as New Zealandisms in the <em>Macquarie Dictionary</em>.  I\nremember the railway station luggage trolley with a short\nwheel fore and aft but did not call it a <em>noddy</em> (the name\nsuggests Enid Blyton's character, mercifully created 'after my\ntime'), and while I remember Maori <em>PT</em> (i.e., 'Physical Training')\nas a way of describing lying down and doing nothing, I\ndid not encounter <em>m.d.o.</em> 'Maori day off' for a 'day off work,'\nthe Australian <em>sickie</em> with even more of a hint of leadswinging.\nI knew <em>dag</em> for a 'hard case' or 'amusingly eccentric person'\nand also <em>dag</em> for the 'wool impacted with excreta on the back\nend of a sheep,' but when a very eminent lexicographer\nrecently heard his New Zealand niece say, “Well I must rattle\nmy dags and be off,” he was not more surprised and amused\nthan I would be.</p>\n<p>I have not heard a lamb's testicles called <em>mountain oysters</em>\n(also U.S.) nor an unpleasant person called a <em>drop kick</em> nor a\nmental hopital called a <em>rat factory</em>—there is a tendency to\ncrudity in some of the New Zealand idiom—nor a sweetbriar\ncalled <em>missionary</em> (but <em>lawyer</em> for an equally engaging briar was\nquite familiar), nor have I encountered <em>hairy</em> meaning 'dilapidated.'\nThese expressions may then be new or were less than\nuniversal a couple of decades ago.  In some cases, changed\nconditions have brought change.  Opossums are recent imports\nfrom Australia but now prolific, so that the word <em>joey</em> (in\nAustralia a 'baby kangaroo') for an opossum is likely to be\nrecent.  <em>Pottle</em>, which I knew as a 'container for strawberries,' is\nnow used for a 'carton of hot chips' (french-fried potatoes), a\nresult no doubt of the growth of the fast-foods industry.\n<em>Birdcage boy</em> a 'used-car dealer' is another mark of this sort of\nprogress.  The reference is to a wire-fenced display yard.</p>\n<p>In many cases I can't be certain now whether I knew an\nexpression or not.  I knew <em>Pongo</em> as a rather derogatory word\nfor an Englishman (Australian <em>Pom</em>) and would certainly have\nunderstood <em>Pongolia</em> 'England,' but did I know it live or learn\nit, as I would learn Old Norse, from professional literature?  I\nmore or less knew a <em>huntaway</em> was a 'dog trained to drive\nsheep forward' but when did I first know <em>Nelson huntaway</em> a\n'boulder rolled down a hill to start sheep'?  (The slur on Nelson\nprovince is no more justified than the slur on Taranaki province\nin <em>Taranaki gate</em>, a movable bit of a wire fence.)</p>\n<p>There seems to be an increasing use of diminutives in\nNew Zealand, either shortened forms or forms in -<em>ie</em> (not in -<em>o</em>\nas in Australia).  A 'semi-trailer,' called an <em>articulated lorry</em> in\nBritain and New Zealand, is briefly an <em>artic</em>; a 'donnybrook' is\na <em>donny</em>; a 'locomotive' a <em>loci</em>; a 'milkman' a <em>milkie</em>; a 'nappy' a\n<em>nap</em>; a 'differential' a <em>diffy</em>.  All of these are new to me.  A\nnumber relate to occupations: a <em>slabby</em> handles slabs; a <em>crosscutter</em>\nuses a crosscut saw; a <em>gummy</em> digs for kauri gum (if he is\nnot an old toothless sheep); and a farmer talks of his <em>chow</em>\n'chou moellier.'  <em>Chow</em> in the sense of 'food' is known, as are\nmany Americanisms through films, books, and television programs,\nbut is not used much.  The local word is <em>tucker</em>.</p>\n<p>All this is, of course, only a random selection from the\ntreasures of New Zealand's colloquial vocabulary, but it is time\nto say Hooray.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
