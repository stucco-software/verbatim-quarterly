Hattendorf and J. Worth Estes, (Henry Holt &amp; Co. 1995).</p>\n<p>This dictionary was published too late for me. I became a Patrick O'Brian fan about 20 years and fifteen (of seventeen) volumes ago. O'Brian's is a roman fleuve recounting the 1790-1815 continuing adventures of his ship captain hero, Jack Aubrey, Royal Navy, and of Aubrey's best friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, ship's surgeon, a naturalist and spy for the British. The enthusiasm of the public for these volumes has increased exponentially with encomiums like, “The best sea stories,” and then, “The best historical novels ever written.” There are fan clubs now all over the world for these enthusiasts. (Charlton Heston is head of the Southern California chapter.) For non-epopts: reading these is like reading Jane Austen—with every so often a hellish sea battle or shipwreck.</p>\n<p>In order to enjoy O'Brian's novels, I have read them with a <em>Hammond Atlas</em> at one side and the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> at the other. That is tedious. Had a <em>Sea of Words</em> been published years ago, I would have been most grateful. Anyone would have needed lexicographic succor. Such words as <em>limicole, catharping, xebec, siriasis</em>— as well as boxing the compass, the sails of a full rigged ship, chains, deadeyes, shrouds, halyards, and stays, are all well explained in this book, including pictures of how a square—rigged warship had its sails raised, lowered, and tacked, an incredibly complicated and difficult procedure. Maps and diagrams of engagements are included. At the back is a bibliography of dozens of other Napoleonic era sea stories by other authors.</p>\n<p>As a physician, I can usually find errors in a lay author's medical orientation, but not with O'Brian! The only thing that I have not been able to find in medical dictionaries, the <em>OED</em>, or even in <em>A Sea of Words</em>, is his use of the word <em>marthambles</em>, which remains unknown to me.</p>\n<p>If every enthusiastic reader of Patrick O'Brian buys a copy of this book, it will be a best-seller. As one enthusiast, I would recommend the purchase.</p>\n<p><em>[Murray C. Zimmerman, Whittier, California]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
