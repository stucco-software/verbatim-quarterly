Jackson Bates: HBJ, 1977, p. 65, 173) repeated\nthe assumption that Latin is more concise, more compressed\nthan English.

In church one Sunday I\ncounted in the Pater Noster 103 Latin syllables, 77 English\nsyllables, though on the page the Latin looks shorter.</p>\n<p>For 40 years I have accepted the conventional wisdom\nthat Latin was the briefer language.  Now that my doubts are\naroused, I even wonder about German, Hawaiian, or any\nother language that piles the syllables into words.  Won't they\nwin the brevity sweepstakes?</p>\n<p>It's true that may translations from Latin take more\nwords in English; but then, as Steiner and many more have\npointed out, <em>all</em> translations take more words because the\nreader of the second language doesn't have the background of\nthe reader of the original language.  To translate from modern\nEnglish into the Latin of Cicero's time could take many\nextra words and paraphrases for terms like <em>Watergate</em> and\n<em>SALT II.</em></p>\n<p>My purpose here is not to convince but to show a prima\nfacie case for asking:</p>\n<p>(1)  Who first raised the point that one should count the\nsyllables and not the words?  (My source may have been a\njournal of education in the fifties or early sixties.)</p>\n<p>(2)  Does anyone have hard evidence or irrefutable logic\n—not just opinion—in the matter?</p>\n<h1></h1>",
