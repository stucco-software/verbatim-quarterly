It can be done. Think <em>Rebecca</em>. Or try <em>Hedda Tesman</em>. Parse <em>Cousin Bette</em>. Encompass <em>Anna Karenina</em>: while not as revelatory as <em>War \\?\\ Peace</em>, that title is every bit as sweeping in a related arena: do not forget that the eponymous character departs the book some fifty pages before it ends, leaving her name as a metaphor for the deadly effects of society's conventions, as Tolstoy saw them, on the soul. Thus, the title becomes equally appropriate as an umbrella for Anna's story, its consequences on her contemporaries, and the novel's preoccupation with the agrarian defection from that society of (Tolstoy's stand-in) Levin.</p>\n<p>Subtitling, also encouraged by Ms. Whitehead, can conspire magnificently with a plot-revealing title: “A Novel Without a Hero” says it all; “Or, The Modern Prometheus” tells us what Mrs. Shelley had in mind; “A Tale of the Christ” prepares us for more than chariot races, and so on.</p>\n<p>Opening lines of a novel, play, or short story can also reveal plot schema.</p>\n<p>Punning titles, I would suggest, as titillating as they may be, have become an editorial addiction of popular magazines. If they are not fed to us with restraint, they can soon render us dangerously overgorged on pop corn.</p>\n<p>[Peter Rankin, New York City]</p>\n<h2></h2>",
