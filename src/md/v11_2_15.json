Abate</em></p>\n<p>Very early in any formal study of English we are taught\nthat the grammaticaf heritage of the language is Germanic.\nThis is demonstrated by certain fundamental characteristics of\nEnglish, such as (a) the essential meaning of sentences is\ndependent upon patterns of word order; (b) auxiliary verbs are\nused to denote tense, mood, and aspect; (c) two basic classes of\nverbs, “strong” and “weak,” are present; and (d) there is\nunmistakable evidence of regular sound changes similar to\nthose in other Germanic tongues.  Despite all of this, the loss of\nmost inflectional endings and the many thousands of non-Germanic\nvocabulary borrowings by English have done much\nto mask the inherent nature of the language.  Indeed, there is a\npopular fallacy, still in circulation, asserting that Latin is the\nultimate ancestor of English.  Notwithstanding the overwhelming\ninfluence of Latin on the English lexicon, which gave rise\nto this fallacy, it is safe to say that English is unquestionably\nGermanic in its grammatical core.</p>\n<p>It does not necessarily follow, however, that English\ngrammar has remained totally unaffected by Romance influence.\nThe Norman aristocracy may have been unable to\nsupplant the language of the native English, but their social\nand intellectual influence was vast, and the effect of this, long\nrecognized in our vocabulary, can also be seen in English\nsyntax.</p>\n<p>Linguists distinguish between Germanic and Romance\nlanguages by noting that the former regularly place an adjectival\nmodifier before the noun, while the latter have the\nmodifier following (albeit with certain special exceptions).\nThus, English speaks of <em>green beans, open window</em>, and a\n<em>private room</em>, while the equivalents in French are <em>haricots\nverts, fenêtre ouverte</em>, and <em>salon privé</em>, all showing the reverse\nof the English pattern of adjective-noun.</p>\n<p>But then, what of phrases such as <em>court martial, attorney\ngeneral, heir apparent</em>, and the like, which violate the English\nrule?  These three are not all, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>abbot general</em><br>\n<em>accounts payable</em><br>\n<em>accounts receivable</em><br>\n<em>annuity certain</em><br>\n<em>bend sinister</em> (and other terms in heraldry)<br>\n<em>body politic</em><br>\n<em>fee simple</em><br>\n<em>fee tail</em><br>\n<em>knight errant</em><br>\n<em>Knights Templar</em><br>\n<em>malice aforethought</em><br>\n<em>mother superior</em><br>\n<em>postmaster general</em><br>\n<em>president-elect</em><br>\n<em>retort discourteous</em><br>\n<em>secretary general</em><br>\n<em>sum total</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These can be viewed merely as relics that have become\nfixed in the language by tradition.  Norman influence was\nparticularly strong in the areas of law, government, church\nHierarchy, heraldry, and the manners of the court.  Norman\nterms used in these fields were doubtless borrowed verbatim\ninto English, so that now these phrases seem quite natural to\nnative speakers of English.  Other examples of Romance combinations\nused in English can be found in literary and other\nformal phraseology; these, too, may be borrowings, or loan\ntranslations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>devil incarnate</em><br>\n<em>God Almighty</em><br>\n<em>poet laureate</em><br>\n<em>rhyme royal</em><br>\n<em>third person plural</em>, etc.<br>\n<em>time immemorial</em><br>\n<em>Vanity Fair</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other literary examples could be added, but we have\nintentionally tried to avoid listing phrases that may reflect\nrhetorical use of the figure <em>anastrophe</em>.</p>\n<p>Even without the poetic combinations, we have a goodly\nlist of Romance combinations, several of them of considerable\nfrequency in the language.  Is it too far-fetched to suggest that\nthese phrases, owing to their vitality and venerability, have\ncontributed a non-Germanic pattern of word order to English?\nCertain examples, some of them certainly of recent vintage,\ngive evidence that this pattern may be not only a syntactic\npossibility, but a productive part of the language:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>ace high</em><br>\n<em>Boston proper</em>, etc.<br>\n<em>Agent Orange penny dreadful</em><br>\n<em>body beautiful</em> (cf. <em>The prizes galore</em> (cf. <em>Pussy</em> <em>Galore</em>, femme fatale in one of Fleming's James Bond stories)<br>\n<em>Body Principal</em>, a fitness book by TV personality Victoria Principal)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Readers are invited to supplement these lists and to\nsubmit their observations of other grammatical influences that\nnon-Germanic languages have had on English.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
