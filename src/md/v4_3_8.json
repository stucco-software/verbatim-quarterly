They simply Scotch-tape a preposition\nlike a prefix onto a verb, and presto, they have a viable new\nword which likely has little to do with its parent.  Idiom\ngoverns connotation of the compound.  The non-native speaker\nmust beware.  I once informed house guests that they were\nwelcome to stay with me, since I had often <em>umgebracht</em> friends\nat my place before.  I should have said <em>untergebracht</em>.  Terrified,\nthey retreated to a nearby inn.  'To have (someone)\nspend the night' is <em>unterbringen</em>, whereas <em>umbringen</em> means\n'to murder' them.</p>\n<p>Somehow I made it unscathed through one year at the\nUniversität in München.  I certainly learned one thing: The\nprofs don't teach you all you need to know in a seminar listed\nDeutsch Semester 3.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
