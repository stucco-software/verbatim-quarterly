Some titles are catchy, and easy to\nremember, like H.G. Well's <em>Kipps</em> (1905), or Paul\nTheroux's <em>The Old Patagonian Express</em> (1978), and\nsome are less memorable, such as Frank Moor-house's\n<em>Tales of Mystery and Romance</em> (1977), or\nCarlyle's <em>On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic\nin History</em> (1841).  But at least they are reasonably\nstraightforward and comprehensible.</p>\n<p>What I am getting at are titles with skew spellings,\nrogue punctuation, and “weird and wonderful”\nnames and words that are difficult to relate to anything\nmeaningful.</p>\n<p>Why, for example, does Bruce Chatwin's highly\nreadable collection of anecdotes and <em>aperçus, What\nAm I doing Here</em> (1989), have no question mark?  Or\ncome to that, why didn't he call it <em>What I Am Doing\nHere?</em>  What is the significance, if any, of this small\ndeviation from the norm?  And what was Stephen\nKing up to, calling his novel <em>Pet Semetary</em> (1983)?\nEven Garrison Keillor's lovely <em>Lake Wobegon Days</em>\n(1985) had me worried.  Why should I make an extra\neffort to remember that the name of the “1001st\nlake in Minnesota,” as he describes it, is a twisted\nversion of <em>woebegone?</em>  The trouble with such “off”\nspellings and punctuations is that you really need to\nremember two extra things, on top of the little itself:\nfirst, that the title is “deviant,” and second, how it is\ndeviant.</p>\n<p>However, the fact remains that all through literrary\ntitles in English there are such irritants, and I\nthought I might as well tackle the issue head on and\nsee where the longstanding and popularly perpetrated\nsnags lay.  I offer my findings in the hopes that\nfellow readers and media followers will be able to\nsee some light in this particular thicket, as I think I\ncan myself discern now.</p>\n<p>Let us take the matter of name spellings first,\nwhether personal names or place names, real names\nor fictitious ones.  Here are some classics: Smollett's\nnovel is <em>Humphry Clinker</em> (1771), not “Humphrey”;\nRichardson's is <em>Clarissa Harlowe</em> (1748), not “Harlow”;\nDefoe's is <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (1719), not\n“Cruso”; Rider Haggard's is <em>Allan Quatermain</em>\n(1887), not “Quartermain” or “Quatermaine.”  (A\nslap on the wrist here to William Rose Benét's <em>The\nReader's Encyclopedia</em> and Kenneth McLeish's\n<em>Bloomsbury Good Reading Guide,</em> which respectively\ngive the latter misspellings.)  Also in this\ngroup, I would say, are Emily Brontë's <em>Wuthering\nHeights</em> (1846), not “Weathering,” “Withering,” or\nany similar fancy, and, admittedly more trickily, Aldous\nHuxley's <em>Crome Yellow</em> (1921), not 'Chrome,”\nalthough of course the pun on this word is intentional.\n(Crome is the name of a house, just as\nWuthering Heights is.)  And we can conveniently\nadd a couple of pause-causing poetic titles here, too:\nThomas Moore's <em>Lalla Rookh</em> (1817), and not a jot\notherwise, and Tennyson's <em>The Lady of Shalott</em>\n(1832), not “Shallot,” which makes the lady smack\nstrongly of veganism.</p>\n<p>It is only one small step from such pitfalls to\nthose holding punctuational and related snares, the\nlatter often involving the problem of whether a title\nis one word or two.  The apostrophe has much to\nanswer for here, as it does in everyday English.  So\nlet us note: James Joyce's novel is <em>Finnegans Wake</em>\n(1939), not “Finnegan's,” E. M. Forster's is\n<em>Howards End</em> (1910) (another house name, by the\nway), not “Howard's,” and, a potential double delusion,\nShakespeare's famous play is <em>Love's Labour's\nLost</em> (1598), with two apostrophes.  The first of these\nis the possessive, the second represents the vowel of\n<em>is</em>.  (The Joyce title is typical of the author's linguistically\ninventive but allusive style, and is actually a\ncompound of two proper names: that of Finn\nMaCool, the Irish folk-hero, and Tim Finnegan, the\nhero of a music-hall ballad, who sprang to life in the\nmiddle of his own wake.)</p>\n<p>Hyphens can cause difficulties, too.  So Melville\nwrote <em>Moby-Dick</em> (1851) and John Buchan's autobiography\nwas called <em>Memory Hold-the-Door</em> (1940),\nbut Robertson Davies wrote <em>Tempest Tost</em> (1951),\nwith no hyphen.  As for the “one-or-two-word”\nproblem, Walter Scott wrote <em>Redgauntlet</em> (1824) and\nJohn Buchan (again) named his novel of Scottish adventure\n<em>Huntingtower</em> (1922).</p>\n<p>While we're about it, we should not overlook\nColeridge's poem, <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>\n(1798), not “Rhyme,” or Byron's <em>Childe Harold's\nPilgrimage</em> (1811), not “Child,” or Ruskin's <em>Arrows\nof the Chace</em> (1880), not “Chase.”  Both Byron's and\nRuskin's wayward words are directly related to their\nmodern equivalents but have essentially historic\nspellings.</p>\n<p>And there we have another whole river to cross,\nsince some of the best-known literary works have\nretained their historic titles, complete with outmoded\nspellings and punctuations.  Spenser is notoriously\ntroublesome here, with <em>The Shepheardes Calender</em>\n(1579), <em>The Faerie Queene</em> (1590) and <em>Mother\nHubberds Tale</em>(1591) among the greatest hazards.\nIn a sense, it seems illogical that we have retained\nthe historic spellings for Spenser's works yet use\nmodern spellings for the titles of plays by his contemporary,\nWilliam Shakespeare.  But perhaps it is\njust as well that we have A <em>Midsummer Night's\nDream</em> (1600), not <em>A Midsommer nights dream</em>, as it\noriginally was when first published, and <em>Henry the\nFifth</em> (or <em>Henry V</em>) (1600), not <em>Henry the fift</em>.  A later\ntitle, but still with “olde-worlde” spelling, is Izaak\nWalton's <em>The Compleat Angler</em> (1653), which oddly\nenough, seems to present little problem.</p>\n<p>What can cause a bout of head-scratching is deciding\nwhether the definite or indefinite article is\ninvolved.  One Shakespeare play that quite often\ngoes wrong is <em>The Winter's Tale</em> (1611)—“The,” not\n“A,”—while Jerome K. Jerome, giving no trouble at\nall with <em>Three Men in a Boat</em> (1889), followed it up\nby taking the same characters on a tour of Germany\nin <em>Three Men on the Bummel</em> (1900).  The last word\nof this is the name of a river, so “A” is quite out of\norder.  (Kenneth McLeish, once again hold your\nhand out!)</p>\n<p>A sort of juvenile one-off here, spellingwise, is\nDaisy Ashford's charming novel, written when she\nwas only nine.  <em>The Young Visiters</em> (1919).  The authoress\nmay be excused her youthful slip, but once\nshe has made it, we are obliged to preserve it!\nAmong the true deviants, the titles that are neither\nimmediately nor even sometimes ever really meaningful\n(although they may become so during the\nreading of the book), are the mini-minefields of such\nas Lisa Alther's <em>Kinflicks</em> (1976), Mervyn Peake's\n<em>Gormenghast</em> (1950), and Peter Carey's <em>Illywhacker</em>\n(1985).</p>\n<p>Of course, similar titular problems occur in areas\noutside literature, too.  Vaughan Williams's chilly\nsymphony that developed out of his music for the\n“British hero” movie <em>Scott of the Antarctic</em> (1948)\nwas actually entitled <em>Sinfonia Antartica</em> (1953),\nwhich seems rather perverse.  And John Gay's greatest\nbut much more light-hearted work was called\n<em>The Beggar's Opera</em> (1728), singular, not plural.\nEven more obviously in the world of musical (and\nvisual) entertainment, it is worth noting that the <em>Folies\nBergè</em> are spelled with the first word plural,\nbut the second singular.  (Editor of <em>Everyman's Encyclopxdia</em>,\nwrite it out a hundred times!).</p>\n<p>Well, I'm off to bed now, for good re-read of\nAnthony Burgess's <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> (1962).  At\nleast, I <em>think</em> it's “A”....</p>\n<h1></h1>",
