Some writers refined the system and more subtly\ncontrived nomenclature that sounded reasonably authentic\nand yet suggested temperament and behavior: <em>Becky Sharp</em>\n(in Thackeray's <em>Vanity Fair</em>), <em>Lucy Snowe</em> (in Charlotte\nBrontës <em>Villette</em>), <em>Slope</em> (in Trollope's <em>Barchester Towers</em>),\n<em>Gabriel Oak</em> (in Hardy's <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em>).  Such\nconventions, though not completely dead, have little life left\nin them today, since on the whole modern writers of fiction\ntry to name their personages in what they hope is a realistic\nfashion.  They attempt, however, to avoid names that might\nbe considered inappropriate or unconvincing when attached\nto particular people.  A fictional character who is supposed to\nbe heroic or who is meant to move the reader to sympathize\nwith his tragic predicament cannot be given a name that may\nsound ludicrous or vulgar.  A pretty young girl cannot be called\nby a name that evokes an image of an ugly harridan.  A factory\nworker should not have a name associated with an ancient\naristocratic family.  Social class, occupation, age, nationality,\nand the law of libel are all relevant factors.  (I forbear\nto quote examples, because subjective opinion would obviously\nbe involved in my choice and because certain people\nmight well be offended if they saw that I had placed their\nown names in derogatory categories).  Nevertheless, despite\nthe care that authors may take nowadays to be realistic and\nconvincing, the names of some personages in novels, short\nstories, plays, and films occasionally strike me as typically fictional\nin a way that I can exemplify but cannot easily define\n(though I shall make an attempt).</p>\n<p>Looking through a recent copy of the weekly, the <em>Radio\nTimes</em>, which gives details of BBC television and radio broadcasts,\nI found the following names amongst the dramatis personae\nof films and plays: <em>Helen Carobleat, Jonas Bradlaw,\nRodney Gloss, Rupert Hillyard, Marcus Gwill, Detective-Inspector\nPurbright, Juliette Baldock, Yvette Marson, Gladys</em>\n<em>Trimble, Bridget Madderley, Steptoe, Wilfred Hargreaves,\nMiss Billinge, Rupert Lovell, George Underdown, Derek\nPaynton, George Barford, Agnes Remnant, Mr. Posling, Joanna\nFinch</em>, and <em>James Fenner-Baxter</em>.  I then turned to the\nEveryman <em>Dictionary of Fictional Characters</em> (edited by William\nFreeman, revised by F. Urquhart, 1973), and chose\nthese surnames in alphabetical order: <em>Armitage, Beverley,\nCarruthers, Drewitt, Effingham, Frensham, Golightly, Harrington,\nInglewood, Joliffe, Kershaw, Longstaff, Manderson,\nNorrington, Osgood, Pargiter, Rumbold, Singleton, Turnbull,\nUpdike, Verrinder, Wyvern</em>, and <em>Yolland</em>.  Now I think\nthat anyone who saw all those names listed in isolation and\nwithout explanatory comment would instantly guess that\nthey could belong only to fictional people.</p>\n<p>After considering these names, I think it is possible tentatively\nto define some common characteristics.  The points I\nam going to make apply to the surnames, since generally\nthere is, I think, less that is notable in fictional personages'\nChristian names, although some combinations have a typical\nring about them (for example, <em>Joanna Finch</em>).  First, the\nnames are all, I suppose, slightly unusual, but not of course\nfantastic in the way that Dickens's names can be.  In fact, a\nconsultation of the 1977 London telephone directory shows\nthat most of them are in actual everyday use, although some\nhave only one or two entries.  Secondly, almost all of them\nhave at least two syllables, thereby giving a hint of rhythm,\nand are also euphonious, with a noticeable predominance of\n“I” and “r” sounds.  Thirdly, some suggest (or really are) place names, with such endings as -<em>dike, -down, -ford, -ham, -ton,\n-wood</em>, and -<em>yard</em>.  These three features lead me to conclude\nthat the majority of the names tend to convey to the reader a\npleasant English ordinariness, just tinged with eccentricity\nand humor, although I realize that this description may not\nbe applicable to all the holders of the names.  This diffident\nconclusion of mine shows that in this note I am referring\nmainly to English fiction, which in this respect has more limited\nresources than American fiction, since it has not at its disposal\nthe enormous range and variety of names that are\nnaturally available in the United States.  On the other hand,\nEnglish names can perhaps more clearly suggest such things\nas social status and regionalism.</p>\n<p>Readers of VERBATIM may like to explore this topic further\nin future issues.  It would be especially illuminating to\nhear from writers of fiction who could give us particulars\nabout the factors responsible for the names they themselves\nhave chosen for their fictional personages.</p>",
