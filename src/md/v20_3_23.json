Barry, (MIT Press, 1991), xv + 268pp.</p>\n<p>It is disappointing to see <em>MIT</em> Press publishing a book of such indifferent quality. Barry writes breezily and spiritedly, but his journalistic style is better suited to the computer magazines for which he toils than to a book, which requires not only good organization but familiarity with the kind of research needed to get at the facts. This is not a dictionary; though there is a brief glossary at the back of the book, the text concerns itself mainly with a discussion of terminology and of various aspects in the development of the computer. Some of what he writes is accurate, some is simply wrong: for example, <em>babble</em> and <em>Babel</em> are not (always) homophones [p. 4]; the name of the company that typeset the first edition of the <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em> [<em>AHD</em>] (1969) was Inforonics, not “Infonics” [p. 29]; the slavish copying, throughout, from the <em>Random House Unabridged [RHD], Second Edition [RHD2],</em> of dates (most of which had been slavishly copied from the dated citations in the <em>OED</em> and other sources) and accepting them as gospel denotes extreme naiveté. His criticism of the <em>AHD's</em> showing “a person who computes” as the first definition of <em>computer</em> is entirely in keeping with the facts of the day, notwithstanding the appearance of <em>computer-composed</em> on the copyright page; on the basis of frequency, the word would not have merited its own entry a dozen years earlier, when it would have been a run-on to <em>compute,</em> with a self-evident sense. Even in 1966, when the first edition of the <em>RHD</em> was published, the first sense listed for <em>computer</em> was “one who computes.”</p>\n<p>The book is a mixture of fact, half-fact, and omissions. How can one discuss microcomputers without mentioning the Osborne and its developer? How can one pretend to be presenting information about typesetting in terms that reveal complete ignorance of hot-metal systems and their terminology and without mentioning the Lanston Monotype?</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is the kind of book that appeals to the people whom Barry is writing about, but the racily written text is so jargon-ridden, so overloaded with the kinds of semi-literate, obtuse puns and silly jokes favored by the inhabitants of Silicon Valley (who, with all their genius for developing microchips and making them do incredible things, were unable to write a coherent manual that anyone but another idiot-savant could understand) that I was unable to get beyond the halfway mark (where one finds sections headed Getting Serviced [p. 124] and Gimme That Realtime Religion [p. 125]). There might be a place in the world for a computer engineer's jokebook, but it never occurred to me that MIT press would be its publisher.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
