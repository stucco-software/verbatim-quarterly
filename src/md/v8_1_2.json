Way, has questioned “a couple of interpretations”\nof mine, and I have been asked to reply.  The\noriginal article was necessarily condensed.  Mr. Way's\nquestions are well taken and deserve fuller\nconsideration.</p>\n<p>The first: “Isn't it more likely that the Silk Stocking\ngroup of names refers to the higher-class gentlemen\nwho probably inhabited those districts in colonial\ntimes?  Dated, yes, but more likely to be validated than\nthe reference to women.”  I think Mr. Way is right on\nthis.  Mathews's <em>Dictionary of Americanisms</em> [<em>DA</em>],\nunder <em>silk-stocking gentry,</em> quotes Thomas Jefferson,\n1812: “I trust ... the Gores and Pickerings will find\ntheir levees crowded with silk-stocking gentry, but no\nyeomanry.”  I should certainly have remembered this\ncharacterization of the wealthy and luxurious class.  I did\nat least remark that the “Silk Stocking” place names\n“must have been widespread and firmly established to\nhave turned up in 54 of our responses.”  Some could\nwell go back to colonial times.  On the other hand, my\nattribution to women may not be altogether wrong: a\nmore recent transfer of the sense from men to women,\nnow that men no longer wear silk stockings, might\nexplain the preservation of this type of name until today.</p>\n<p>The second question: “I think ... names such as\nFrogtown and Coontown, ... belong down in the ethnic\nand racial slur categories rather than with the animal\nnames.”  My answer is Yes and No: there are some of\neach, but in our <em>DARE</em> data, even discounting some\nindeterminate ones, the animal references clearly outnumber\nthe ethnic ones.  Our St. Charles, Missouri,\ninformant mentioned <em>Frenchtown</em>, and also “<em>Frogtown,</em>\nwhere the poor people live.”  These may or may not be\nthe same place.  The Campbelltown, Florida, informant\nmentioned “<em>Frogtown,</em> lower class, wrong side of the\ntracks” but did not identify it as French.  The name was\ngiven in places where the presence of specifically\nFrench-derived communities are not noted: Villisca,\nIowa, and Lake Pleasant, New York, mentioned <em>Frog\nHollow;</em> there is <em>Frog Village</em> near Douglas, Massachusetts,\nand <em>Froggy Bottom</em> in the District of Columbia.\nThe <em>Frog Town</em> near Huntsville, Alabama, and that near\nDover, Delaware, are indeterminate.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the <em>Frog Town</em> of Carrollton,\nKentucky, is “down by the river” (which looks more like\nfrogs than French); that in Little Falls, Minnesota, is “a\nwet area with an abundance of frogs”; the observation\nthat in St. Charles, Missouri, “a lot of water stood\nthere,” does not eliminate the French but favors the\nfrogs.  The Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, informant clearly\nsays, “There used to be a swampy area filled with\nfrogs.” <em>Frog Level</em>, near Abingdon, Virginia, is “lowland,\nwet in spring; frogs were heard there first.”  The <em>Frog\nPond</em> near New Bern, North Carolina, is not likely a\nFrench settlement.  The <em>Frog Hollow</em> of North Prescott,\nMassachusetts, named along with <em>Puppyville,</em> is probably\nan animal rather than an ethnic reference.  That\nsome uses of <em>Frog Town</em> were ethnic cannot be denied,\nbut <em>Frenchtown</em> seems to have been preferred in\nPentwater and Onaway, Michigan, in Chillicothe, Ohio,\nand no doubt in other places.</p>\n<p>As to the <em>coon</em> names, we have three indeterminate\nones: <em>Coon Bottom</em> in Quincy, Florida, and Waycross,\nGeorgia, and <em>Coon's Corner</em> near Edenton, North Carolina.\nBut the reference is clear elsewhere: <em>Coon Bottom</em>\nis the “Negro section” in Gifford, Florida, and Salem,\nNew Jersey, and near St. Martinsville, Louisiana, the\nsettlement once called <em>Faubourg</em> is “now called <em>Coon\nTown</em>, where the Negroes live.”  On the other hand, the\nNapoleon, Ohio, informant mentioned among local\nnames <em>Ratsville, Dog Town, Goose Town, Snaketown,</em>\nand <em>Coon Hollow</em>.  Evidently his mind was running on\nanimals, and this is not an ethnic reference.  Also, the\n<em>Coon Town</em> near Cooter, Missouri, is “now <em>Holland</em>.  It\nwas just woods, then, and filled with coons.”  The new\nname may indicate a desire to avoid the appearance of\nan ethnic slur, but the former name certainly referred to\nanimals.</p>\n<p>In sum, it should be noted that, in the North,\n<em>raccoon</em> is more likely to be used of the animal and <em>coon</em>\nis now avoided by many people in reference to blacks.\nEven in 1965-70, when our data were being collected,\ninformants would remark of such potentially insulting\nwords, “We don't say that any more.”  Consciousness\n<em>was</em> being raised.  In the South, <em>coon</em> is still generally\nused of the animal.  The historical fact should also be\nnoted that in the past century (<em>DA</em> 1832 to 1897) <em>coon</em>\nwas commonly used to mean simply 'fellow' or 'person'—the\nequivalent of our modern 'guy'—with rural\nand “canny” connotations but no racial ones.  A white\nmountaineer might say of himself, “This coon is getting\nout of here till the trouble blows over.”  The specialization\nof application to blacks is relatively recent (<em>DA</em>\n1862 forward).</p>\n<h1></h1>",
