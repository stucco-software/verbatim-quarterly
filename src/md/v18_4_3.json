For instance, <em>paperless</em> is emphatically\nnot the first adjective that springs to mind\nto describe the office of an ESPRIT participant.  The\nmore typical ESPRIT decor is, in fact, wall-to-wall paper—much\nof it in curious Euro-colours like mauve\nand puce.  The European Community has, in the few\ndecades of its existence, established quite a reputation\nfor generating paper output on a scale that no\nmere national government has ever aspired to: like\nevery other Euro-initiative ever launched, ESPRIT\ngenerates Euro-text by the ream.  This is rather depressing,\nbecause it suggests that there is no escaping\nthe remorseless Euro-bumf generator even for a\nprogram with an avowed aim of paper reduction.\nHowever, in its own way ESPRIT had indeed made a\nsmall step towards reduction of the European paper\nmountain.  Perhaps inspired by its own acronym, ESPRIT\ninsists that each ESPRIT project, however complex\nits title, choose a single-word acronym by\nwhich it may be identified; and ESPRIT itself never\nrefers to projects by their full names, but only by the\nacronyms.</p>\n<p>Whole forests may be saved by this, as “Speech\nProcessing and Recognition using Integrated\nNeurocomputing Techniques” turns to SPRINT, and\n“Correct Hardware Design Methodology: Towards\nFormal Design and Verification for Provably Correct\nVLSI Hardware” becomes CHARME.  (These are real\nESPRIT projects, by the way.  They are participants in\nESPRIT's Basic Reasearch Actions, or BRA—a less conspicuous\nsupport system.)</p>\n<p>A study of successful ESPRIT acronyms (i.e., the\nacronyms of grant applications which proved successful)\nsuggests certain guidelines.  The ideal acronym\nshould resemble ESPRIT itself by expressing a\nconcept with international acceptance.  It should\npreferably be French in origin, since that may lessen\npotential irritation in Brussels at the fact that the\nacronym invariably represents an English word sequence.\nSo a group which plans to build a Partially\nAutomated Restricted-Access Voice Input/Output\nNetwork would do well to call it PAR-AVION.  Likewise,\na consortium studying Algebraic Methods In\nExpert Neural Systems might call their projects AMIPENS\n(though AMEX would also do quite nicely).</p>\n<p>Just as the right acronym can be the key to a\nproject's success, so can an ill-chosen acronym lead\nto disaster.  Perhaps that is what happened with my\nunsuccessful proposal for a Multiple Entry Reconfigurable\nDialogue Editor (“This project stinks”—\nReferee A), or my Comprehensive Universal Labelled\nDatabase Enumerating System Architecture\nConcepts (“Will this work lead anywhere?”).</p>\n<p>In fact the area of acronym selection is so important\nthat it seems to me there is a technology gap\nhere.  Moreover, a project to fill it is just what ESPRIT\nought to support.  So I plan to call on colleagues\nthroughout Europe to join a consortium which will\ndesign and build a Computational Human-Assisted\nMulti-Purpose Acronym Generator/Neologism Evaluator.\nAll we have to do is think up an acronym\nfor it.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
