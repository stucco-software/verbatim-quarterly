The Dutch and the\nEnglish terms each derive from their own morphological\nconcepts.  In Dutch, <em>blind(e)</em> means 'blind,' <em>darm</em> means 'gut'\nor 'bowel.'  The 'blind gut' is indeed a “blind alley” leading\nfrom the large intestine in that it has no outlet.  In English the\nappendix is so named because it is an appendage hanging from\nthe cecum (also called the <em>blind gut</em>), a section of the large\nintestine.  The Dutch <em>ontsteking</em> means 'inflammation.'  In English\nmedical terminology virtually any body part is designated\nas inflamed by simply adding the suffix -<em>itis</em>.  Running these\nDutch words together (<em>blinde, darm, ontsteking</em>) follows the\nGerman practice of combining a noun with its modifiers into\none word.  In normal everyday Dutch, that is not the usual\ncustom, but it invariably is in German.  Dutch sentence structure\nmore often parallels the English rather than the German,\nthus avoiding many of the jawbreakers so common in German.</p>\n<p><em>[Henrik M. C.
