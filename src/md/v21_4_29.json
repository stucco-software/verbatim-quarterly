My only credentials are that I am a native-born Londoner now in my mid-sixties and have lived all my life until now in London, including a number of years in the East End. Even now, here in Clerkenwell, five minutes' walk from the northern edge of the Square Mile, I am less than a mile from Hackney. I have, willy-nilly, frequently been nudged into the use of such slang simply in order not to stick out like a sore thumb among others using it.</p>\n<p>First, perhaps, we ought to establish what is the East End: roughly, it covers Hackney, Stepney (now known as Tower Hamlets), the Isle of Dogs, and parts of Bow and Poplar. Post-war slum clearance and rehousing broke up the old Jewish communities, and these have been replaced by subsequent waves of immigrants. Hackney now has many Cypriots and even more West Indians; and Stepney houses an enormous number of Pakistanis and other Asians. None of these groups has contributed to rhyming slang. There are therefore no neologisms in rhyming slang and it is definitely moribund. Non-English readers should take very much <em>cum grano salis</em> Mr. Day's claim that Finsbury Park is 'just down the road” from Mile End: it is a crow's-flight distance of 4½ miles away and consequently probably nearly twice that by road, given the nature of London's roads and its density of housing.</p>\n<p>Most of the expressions cited are totally unfamiliar to me, and I suggest that Mr. Day has played with a rhyming dictionary and dreamed many of them up for himself—harmless enough, but he ought not to pass them off as being in common usage. Of those that are known to me, I would point out that even his usage of them is not what one would meet in everyday conversation with East Enders. <em>Potatoes in the Mould</em> certainly clarifies the words used, but we would expect to see, even in print, <em>Talers in the Mould</em>; and in speech we would always say, <em>Isn't it taters today</em> when discussing the temperature.</p>\n<p>It has always, since long before my time, been the custome for only the first part of a compound to be used, such as <em>my old china (=china plate=mate)</em> or <em>up the apples</em> (=<em>apples and pears</em>=<em>stairs</em>), and it is generally believed that this practice first began among the semi-criminal classes to render their speech less easily comprehensible to outsiders. This may or may not be so, but the habit has persisted.</p>\n<p>Mr. Day might once have lived in London, but so have millions of others, and it doesn't necessarily make Londoners of them, nor does it give them more than a passing knowledge of our native speech. I thoroughly enjoy VERBATIM and have always tended to regard articles published therein as reasonably authoritative; but I shall take the liberty in the future to doubt the “experts.” As far as I am concerned, Mr. Day's article is a <em>load of marbles (=marble balls=balls)</em>!</p>\n<p>[Mary Imber, London]</p>\n<p>[Mary Imber went on to chide the Editor for a number of typographical errors—<em>literals</em> in English English—(e.g., “Ford Maddox Ford” for “... Madox ...”) for which only apologies, no excuses, are offered.—Editor]</p>\n<h1></h1>",
