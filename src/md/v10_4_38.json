For novels you may\nnot have read, the subtitles will tell you that <em>The Octopus</em> is not\nan account of an eight-armed mollusk and <em>Green Mansions</em> is\nnot about life on an English country estate.  The subtitles may\neven make you curious to read the books; if so, the words have\nserved their purpose.</p>",
