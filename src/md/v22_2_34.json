Box 307, Pacific Grove, CA 93950, USA).</p>\n<p>Puzzle solvers seem to fall into two categories, those who use reference books to help them find the right answers and those who eschew any aids whatsoever. I have always fallen into the latter category. If I could not identify a missing word in a quotation, I marked that down to my own failing, one that was not likely to be remedied by looking it up in <em>Bartlett</em>, after which it would be promptly forgotten; mercifully, not all clues in puzzles are quotations, so some of them worked out; besides, the word that had to be supplied was usually a very common one and its only connection with the quotation was that it happended to appear in it, like <em>be</em> in “To be or not to be.” For many years, the crossword puzzles published in Britain, like those published in VERBATIM) have been of the “cryptic” kind, differing from the typical American variety by a diagram that does not cross-key every letter of every word and by clues that are not simply straightforward matter, like the solution <em>ers</em> for “bitter vetch” and other otherwise useless bits of information; for one thing, many of the clues are anagrams, which is where <em>Puzlpack</em> comes in. To save space, here is what <em>Puzlpack</em> can do (from the blurb):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>• Find all single-word anagrams: EIPRST yields ESPRIT, PRIEST, RIPEST, SPRITE, STRIPE, TRIPES.</p>\n<p>• Unscramble jumbled words.</p>\n<p>• Find all blank tile substitutions.</p>\n<p>• Find the unknown letters in crosswords: W?R??S yields WIRERS, WORLDS, WORSES, WORSTS, WORTHS, WURSTS.</p>\n<p>• Display all words with any range of lengths in a set of letters.</p>\n<p>• Verify the validity of a word play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not entirely sure that I understand what each of those means (especially “worses” and “worths”), but experienced puzzlers might. The program is simple to load and, once in place, easy to use; it is also extremely fast. The <em>OED on Compact Disc</em> has a facility for finding “blank tile substitutions,” but it does not include all possible inflected forms.</p>\n<p>If everyone had this software, there would be no point in using anagrams in clues, I suppose; on the other hand, not everyone does, and the use of such aids is probably ruled out in competitions where the entrants are controlled—that is, not working at home. It is also useful for puzzlemakers.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
