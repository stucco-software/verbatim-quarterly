Attwater, ed., 3rd ed., 1958, cites “a tendency nowadays to prefer Holy Spirit” because of the “common meaning” of the word <em>ghost</em> referring to “apparitions or illusions.”  <em>Ghost</em>, says the <em>Dictionary</em> is certainly archaic.”</p>\n<p>So it seems that in mid-20th century <em>ghost</em> has been put in the prison of Halloween.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
