I fear that some of the informants on whom\nPartridge relied for American c.p.'s just don't know their\nstuff.</p>\n<p>For example, after you, my dear Alphonse—no, after\nyou, Gaston is given as Canadian in origin (1959).  I heard\nthe c.p. in America in the 1930s and am under the distinct\nimpression that it was borrowed from an older vaudeville\nroutine satirizing French over-politeness.  In a quotation from\na letter from Dr. Joseph T. Shipley under remember Pearl\nHarbor: “after the airplane strike of 6 December 1941...”\nDr. Shipley, as far as I know, is an American: an “airplane\nstrike” would, in American English, be usually taken to mean\nthat the planes are either not being manufactured or not\nflying—not the same as an <em>air strike</em>.  Similarly, the “day\nthat will live in infamy” was Sunday, December 7, 1941—\nregardless of the side of the dateline you were on—a fact that\nused to be known to every schoolboy.  Curiously, we find,\n“Built like a brick shit-house, mostly preceded by he's.  A low\nCanadian phrase, meaning 'he's a very well-made fellow:\nC20.”  Balderdash!  It is an American c.p. and almost <em>never</em>\napplied to a man.  Besides, it is often followed, after a pause,\nby “...and not a brick out of place!”  Another: “all the traffic\nwill bear, often preceded by that's.  Literally, it relates to\nfares and freights; only figuratively it is a c.p., meaning that\nthe situation, whether financial or other, precludes anything\nmore....  It is—Dr Douglas Leechman ['an authority on\nCanadiana'] tells me—said to derive from a US magnate's\ncynicism.”  Poppycock!  First, what does “said to derive” mean?\nSecond, <em>traffic</em> means 'trade, custom,' and the c.p. means\n'charge as much as possible.'  I have my doubts that it was\never used in what Partridge considers its “literal” sense.</p>\n<p>Although I am familiar with the Thurber cartoon and\nhave traveled for years in a crowd familiar with <em>The New\nYorker</em>, I have never heard anyone say “All right—you did\nhear a seal bark.”  As far as I know, my hearing is unimpaired\nwith regard to c.p.'s <em>and</em> the bark of the seal.  Again, Partridge's\nAmerican informants have either slipped badly or took delight\nin sneaking him some home-grown family expressions\nthat the rest of us don't know.  Where is “Sure as God made\nlittle apples”?  “Nobody here but us chickens”?  “No skin off\nmy teeth?”  “...or bust”?</p>\n<p>The general presentation of the book could have been\nimproved considerably by labeling Briticisms as well as\nAmericanisms.</p>\n<p>Partridge's comments are folksy and frequently as long-winded\nas they are inaccurate.  Pop goes the weasel, which\nwe (and Arthur Fiedler) have had up to here in America, is\ndescribed as “Very English.”  Polly put the kettle on and we'll\nall have tea is described as “increasingly obsolescent” since\nWW2, yet I have often heard English people refer to it jocularly\nwhen they offer to put the kettle on to boil: “I'll be Polly.”</p>\n<p>All in all, the <em>Dictionary of Catch Phrases</em>, which resembles\nin spirit, if not in fact, Partridge's <em>Dictionary of\nClichés</em>, might have seemed a good idea when conceived,\nand Partridge undoubtedly had a good time compiling it and\nwriting the comments, but the result is uneven and, in places,\ndownright inaccurate.  It is also somewhat old-fashioned, to\nwit Dr. Joseph T. Shipley's comment of 17 February 1974\nthat that's how (or the way) the cookie crumbles “...is\na rather frequent expression in [New York].”  Perhaps it is\namong septuagenarians.  On the other hand, some informants\nsuffer either from a short memory or a long imagination.\nWhere was Moses when the lights went out?  is from an early\n20c. riddle [the same vintage as “What's black and white\nand re(a)d all over?”], the answer to which is “In the dark”\nor, more elaborately “Down in the cellar in the dark.”</p>\n<h1></h1>",
