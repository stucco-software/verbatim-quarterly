I can anticipate a letter from the\ndescendants of the American linguist George Philip\nKrapp enjoining me from using the word that sounds\nlike his name on pain of a suit for slander.)  It is nothing\nbut codswallop.  (Look out!  Here comes the fisherman's\nlobby!)  And I almost repeated balderdash,\nwhich is sure to lose me the hurried hairless vote.</p>\n<p>NOTICE!
