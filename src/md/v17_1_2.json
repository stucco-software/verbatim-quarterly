Wells, (Longman, 1990), xxviii + 802pp.</p>\n<p>This long-needed book will be welcomed by the\nlinguistic community and by learners of English.\nGeneral dictionaries show pronunciations, it is true,\nbut not in the depth displayed in this work [<em>LPD</em>],\nrarely with its precision, and almost never with both\nAmerican and British pronunciations side by side.</p>\n<p>The immediate questions that arise are Which\nAmerican?  Which British?  The dialect selected for\nAmerican English is General American, that spoken\nby the largest number of speakers (those who do not\ndistinguish among <em>Mary, marry</em>, and <em>merry</em>); that selected\nfor British English, as one might expect, RP\n[Received Pronunciation], “widely regarded as a\nmodel for correct pronunciation ... what is used by\nBBC news readers (hence the alternative name, <em>BBC\npronunciation</em>).”  As far as the first is concerned, it\ndoes not bear the same relationship to American\nEnglish that RP bears to British English: the pronunciation\npattern of the educated speaker in the northeastern\nUS probably retains much of its former status\nand prestige.  Having listened to BBC news\nreaders for many years, I am inclined to regard <em>BBC\npronunciation</em> as an archaic or obsolescent term (unless\none restricts the designation to news readers on\nBBC World Service).  Certainly, the majority of British\nEnglish speakers do not pronounce English in the\nRP pattern, and there is increasing evidence that if\nthey aspire to do so, they are meeting with little\nsuccess.  But this is not a book of descriptive phonetics;\nit is for the learner who aspires to speak the\n“best” English he can, and the selection of these two\ndialects would be hard to fault.</p>\n<p>The pronunciation system used by Wells is\n“broad IPA,” with a few modifications.  It is largely\nphonemic, but there are enough refinements to\nmake it unique.  Wells calls it “LPD.”  I found only\none transcription to quarrel with: by showing \\?\\ as\nthe symbol for the General American sound in both\n<em>lot/odd</em> and <em>start/father</em>, Wells leads one to conclude\nthat General American (like RP) drops <em>r</em>-sounds in\nsyllable-final position.  But that is not the case in\nGeneral American, as the entry for <em>start</em> start bears\nout.  There is some confusion in the key, where the\nspelled characters represented by the phonetic transcription\nare underscored, and the form for General\nAmerican <em>start</em> should have been start, not start.\nMoreover, most American dictionaries make a deliberate\ndistinction between the sounds in <em>odd/lot</em> and\n<em>start/father</em>, with the former often displaying some\nrounding or, at worst, closer to \\?\\ than to \\?\\.  The\ntreatment of <em>nurse</em> and <em>stir</em>, which show \\?\\ for RP and\n\\?\\ for General American is closer to the mark.</p>\n<p>When I worked on the setting up of the pronunciation\nsystem for the Random House dictionaries, I\nexamined sound spectrograms of words that <em>middle,\ntotal, sudden, servant, father, standard</em>, etc., that\nsome phoneticians transcribed using syllabic \\?\\, \\?\\, and\n\\?\\.  What I found was that the syllabics occurred only\nwhen the preceding sound was a dental or alveolar\n(d or t); when it was a velar (k or g), there was\nenough time for a speaker to release a sound which\nwas more like a full schwa than a syllabic.  Indeed,\nthough it is a matter of degree, I find it difficult to\npronounce a word like <em>organism</em> with a syllabic Z\\?\\ at\nend rather than a z\\?\\m.  This is the way <em>organism</em>\nis transcribed in the key; but the text itself shows a\nfull schwa, which indicates that perhaps Wells vacillated\non this point himself.</p>\n<p><em>LPD</em> lists more than 75,000 words, including\nproper names.  The boldface headwords, alas in sansserif\ntype (making it difficult to read words like <em>Pilling,\npillion, pilliwinkle, Illinois</em>, etc., because the\nlower-case <em>i</em> resembles lower-case <em>l</em>, which is hard to\ndistinguish from capital <em>I</em>), are followed by\npronunciations printed in blue, with variants in\nblack, an expensive but worthwhile idea that works\nif you are not reading in a dim light.  General American\npronunciations are easy to find because they\nare separated from RP by double vertical bars.\nPronunciations that are considered incorrect (like\n“fith” for <em>fifth</em>) are preceded by an exclamation\npoint in a triangle; (!)  indicates that a pronunciation\nso marked is different from what the spelling might\nlead one to expect (as in <em>Beaulieu</em> 'bju\\?\\li and <em>Beauchamp</em>\n\\?\\bi\\?\\t\\?\\\\?\\\\?\\m); (*) is 'a warning that the British and\nAmerican pronunciations are different in an important\nand unpredictable way' (e.g., <em>baton</em> \\?\\bætan - \\?\\n ¦¦\nb\\?\\\\?\\ta\\?\\n).  Useful notes abound, e.g., at <em>Mercedes</em>, “The\npl of the tdmk is pronounced the same as the sing, or\nwith -i\\?\\z”; and, passim throughout, results of a poll\ntaken among 275 British English speakers, e.g. “<em>casual</em>\\?\\kæzu\\?\\l\n-ju; \\?\\kæzju; \\?\\kæ\\?\\\\?\\l—<em>BrE poll panel preference</em>:\n\\?\\kæ3- 77%, kæz- 23%.”  Separate treatment is\ngiven, <em>in situ</em>, to prefixed and suffixes, and detailed\ndiscussions of compounds and phrases, connected\nspeech, neutralization, and other phonetic matters\nand language environments that affect pronunciation\nappear in their appropriate alphabetic places.  Each\nspelled sound is discussed at the beginning of its alphabetic\nsection, digraphs being treated at the beginnings\nof the sections for their first letter.</p>\n<p>In sum, there is a wealth of information succinctly\npresented in the pages of <em>LPD</em> which learners,\nlinguists, and lexicographers will be mining for\nmany years to come, including the pronunciation of\n<em>Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllandysiliogogogoch</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
