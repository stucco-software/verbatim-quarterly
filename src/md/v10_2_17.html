<p>G. M. Story, W.J. Kirwin, and J.D.A. Widdowson eds., (University of Toronto Press, 1982), lxxii + 625pp.</p>
<p>The title of this book begs the question.  It is not a
dictionary of all the English spoken in Newfoundland; nor is it
a dictionary of Newfoundlandisms.  It is, broadly speaking, a
dictionary of what is distinctive and characteristic of Newfoundland
English.  It is thus closer in conception to the
<em>Dictionary of American English (DAE)</em> than to the <em>Dictionary
of Americanisms (DA)</em>, while it is closest in scope and format to
<em>A Dictionary of Canadianisms (DC)</em>.  The editors, in fact,
approve the <em>DC's</em> definition of a Canadianism as a “word,
expression, or meaning which is native to Canada or which is
distinctively characteristic of Canadian usage though not necessarily
exclusive to Canada.”  They thus enter regionally relevant
senses of such general English words as <em>bay, coast, harbour</em>,
and alongside such true dialect items as <em>bawn</em>, 'meadow, expanse
of rocks on which salted cod are dried,' <em>coalies</em> 'playing-cards,'
<em>hapse</em> 'hasp,' and <em>shoreyer</em> 'American common eider.'</p>
<p>Much of the scope and stature of the dictionary comes
from the range of the editors' sources and their responsible
treatment of them.  Of their printed sources they say: “Our aim
was to read intensively the body of literature devoted to the
island of Newfoundland and coastal Labrador from its beginning
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries down to about
1850, and thereafter to read and excerpt more selectively as the
volume of material became more extensive” (p. xxi).</p>
<p>Fourteen and a half two-column pages of the Bibliography
authenticate material taken from oral sources, found in the field
records collected specifically for the dictionary and in a
treasure hoard with the engaging name of MUNFLA.  This
acronym does not represent the sound coming from the nostrils
of the dragon guarding the hoard but stands for the Memorial
University of Newfoundland Folklore and Language Archive.
This collection, begun in the early 1960s, now contains a
formidable array of cards, manuscripts, questionnaires, and
tapes, identified when cited in the dictionary by the letters <em>C,
M, Q,</em> and <em>T,</em> respectively.  Field records are identified by the
letter <em>P.</em>  The citation of each such item includes a speaker's or
collector's code and the date of accessioning or recording.</p>
<p>The editors go out of their way to justify their use of oral
sources, but it is hard to see why they felt it necessary, for oral
sources are an important aspect of traditional Newfoundland
culture.  Philip Howard's recent comment just does not apply in
this case: “I believe that the criticism of the <em>OED</em> for
neglecting spoken English is largely mistaken.  It seems that a
new word or new use is written down somewhere almost as
soon as it is coined” [VERBATIM, IX,3].  That may be true of
current English, and it may be true now in St. John's and
Cornerbrook, but it certainly was not true (at least until
recently) in “Fogo, Twillingate, Morton's Harbour, all around
the circle.”</p>
<p>The actual treatment of entry words is marked by precision
and austerity.  Phonetic respellings, for example, given in
<em>IPA,</em> are provided “only when there is firm evidence from
speech or tape, when the regional stress pattern is distinctive
...when the spelling of the headword is misleading... or
when the recorded variants are potentially useful for dialectologists”
(p. xxix).  Pronunciations are, therefore, fewer than seal
hairs in a flipper pie.  In many cases they are not missed, but
not in all.  One would like to see them, for example, for
<em>babbish</em>, also <em>babbage, babeesh</em>, ('strips of animal hide'), for
which there are two oral citations and for which the DC (under
<em>babiche)</em> shows stress on either syllable.  On the one hand, the
editors may be playing safe in their reluctance to give pronunciations;
on the other, they are often leaving the reader in the
lurch.  (Similarly, but perhaps with better cause, the editors
have eschewed the use of using labels, not caring or daring to
indicate whether words are slang or colloquial, archaic or
obsolete.)</p>
<p>Respellings, when given, are part of what is called the
headnote.  To quote the editors yet again, “The main body of
the headnote is taken up with the comparative evidence
presented in other pertinent historical and regional dictionaries,
lexicons of other languages, and a variety of published works
found to be useful” (p. xxix).  This procedure is an extension of
that used in the <em>Dictionary of Jamaican English (DJE)</em>, in
which the notes, being less compressed and more discursive,
are easier to read and more entertaining.  One problem with
these comparative references is that they assume the reader has
to hand the <em>OED, OEDS, EDD, DAE, DA, DC, DJE,</em> and some
other English dictionaries, as well as Dineen's <em>An Irish-English
Dictionary, Joyce's English As We Speak It in Ireland</em>, and a
few other frequently cited references; another is that the use of
these same headnotes is expanded whenever the editors decide
to give etymological information, which they do sometimes
directly and sometimes indirectly.  Thus <em>livyer</em> 'a permanent
coastal settler,' after the citing of forms and of occurrences in
other dictionaries, is overtly referred to the <em>OED</em> treatment of
<em>ier</em> with the direction to compare <em>lovyer, millier</em> (entered as
<em>millyer),</em> and <em>shoreyer</em>.  On the other hand, the entry for <em>caplain</em>
(the fish, merely includes in the comparative references a
mention of the <em>Trésor de la langue francaise</em> entry for French
<em>capelan</em> (fr Provencal), the accepted etymon.</p>
<p>Basically, the editors do not give etymologies where they
are adequately given elsewhere or where there is no firm basis
for a derivation.  It would, however, be helpful if they indicated,
as <em>DFE</em> does, when the etymology of a term is unknown.
Words such as <em>bavin</em> ' “splits” used for kindling' or <em>killick</em> 'a
type of anchor,' for instance, are referred to the <em>OED</em>, so the
reader may well look there for an etymology.  In each case,
however, the <em>OED</em> says the origin is unknown or obscure,
though sume suggested sources are given for <em>bavin</em>.  The editors
scrupulously avoid controversy.</p>
<p>The definitions themselves are clear and concise, and they
make good use of references to other entry words.  These, set
within an entry in small capitals, may be used as defining
synonyms or may be preceded by “See,” “See also,” or “Cp.”
There is a hierarchy of references implied here, but the precise
use and differentiation of these different types of routing
signals is nowhere explained.</p>
<p>Phrases and combinations are given as subentries after the
Oxford pattern, and one cannot help wishing the editors had
followed the more current and predominantly North-American
pattern of consistently entering compounds as main entries.  As
it is, some are and some are not, and some simple entry words
exist only as carriers of subentries for combined forms: for
example, <em>cropping</em> (for <em>cropping shed</em> and <em>cropping time</em>) <em>stark</em>
(for <em>stark-naked tea</em> no milk or sweetening), and <em>cross</em> (adjective,
adverb, and noun, for several combinations each).  Yet
<em>cross-handed</em> is a separate entry and has <em>cross-handed dory</em> and
<em>cross-handed skiff</em> as subentries.  Where, then is the reader
meant to look?</p>
<p>The citations are, as one would expect, one of the
strengths of the dictionary.  It seems that the earliest known use
of a word is given first, followed by as many other citations as
seem useful or justified.  The editors are to be congratulated on
using, as they say, “a greater number of illustrations than is
customary in some historical dictionaries” (p. xxxiii).  It is
surprising, though, how many entries are supported by one
citation only, whether written or spoken.  Some entries have no
citation at all but only a reference to a source.  Thus <em>feck</em>, of
which the total entry reads, “feck n A fine goose feather used
in oiling the works of a clock.  (1027 <em>Christmas Messenger</em> 47)”
What is this <em>feck?</em>  Has it anything to do with either <em>feck</em> in the
<em>OED</em>, with <em>feck</em> as a verb meaning to steal <em>(OEDS)</em>, with
<em>feckless</em>, or even with <em>fitch?</em>  The editors don't know and so
offer no suggestions.  As elsewhere, they present what evidence
they have and leave the rest of the work and worry to the
reader.</p>
<p>Finally, with reference to the presentation of material,
mention should be made of the excellent typography.  It seems
to be modeled on that of the <em>DC,</em> and the same ragged-right
margin and even more generous space between entries give
each page an open, inviting appearance.  One could wish that
the <em>OED</em> pattern had been followed in the setting of part-of-speech
labels in italics, to distinguish them more clearly from
what follows, especially as they are sensibly not followed by a
period.  It also makes sense to have dispensed with periods after
such other abbreviations as <em>comb, phr, cp</em>, and <em>esp</em>.  It would,
however, have been useful if a clearer typographic break could
have been made between a comparative reference or other
headnote discussion and an immediately following definition.
There are no pictures, but there is a ghastly map that seems
more appropriate to students of oceanography than to those of
dialectology: it is good on bathymetric contours but does not
identify the Avalon Peninsula (mentioned in the Introduction)
or any town or city other than St. John's.</p>
<p>On the whole this book is excellent a fine scholarly
achievement, to be as eagerly welcomed as it has been long
awaited.  But there are several ways some minor and some
quite significant in which more help could have been given to
the reader.</p>
