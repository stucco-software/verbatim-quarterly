The Bureau of\nAnimal Affairs writer, like many other English users, apparently\nthought that <em>noisome</em> means “noisy.”  But <em>noisome</em> has\nnothing to do with noise.  In truth, the word is formed from\na shortening of <em>annoy</em> plus the adjectival suffix <em>-some</em>.  Most\nfrequently <em>noisome</em> is used to describe an offensive odor,\nannoying to the point of being nauseous.</p>\n<p>Last year, a March 1984 catalogue from a Portland,\nMaine, publishing company came in my mail.  The cartoon\non the cover shows Shakespeare's Juliet, standing on her balcony,\ngazing off into the distance, and asking, “Wherefore\nart thou, teaching aids?”  Lower on the page, Romeo stares\nup at Juliet and says, “Inside!  Eighteen new publications\nplus many other fine materials.”  I would hope that most of\nmy fellow Inmates in the House of Correction (of Composition)\ncaught the blooper.  Quite obviously, the publisher of\nEnglish materials interpreted <em>wherefore</em> as meaning 'where,'\na mistake that has been perpetuated by generations of\nwould-be actresses who misconstrue the famous line in\n<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, “O Romeo, Romeo!  wherefore art thou\nRomeo?”  But a knowledgeable examination of Shakespeare's\nlanguage—“Wherefore rejoice?  /What conquest brings he\nhome?”  (<em>Julius Caesar</em>, I, i, 32-33); “But wherefore could\nnot I pronounce 'Amen'?”  (<em>Macbeth</em> II, ii, 39)—reveals that\n<em>wherefore</em> means 'why,' not 'where,' further proof being the\npleonastic cliché “the whys and wherefores.”  Thus, those\nwho deliver the sentence “Wherefore art thou Romeo?”\nshould place emphasis on the word <em>Romeo</em> rather than on\nthe word <em>art</em>.</p>\n<p>Then there is the general who extended his “most fulsome\ncongratulations” to a medal recipient.  It is true that the\noriginal meaning of <em>fulsome</em> was 'full, abundant,' but the\nwell-meaning general overlooked the dominant sense of the\nword today—'offensive to the senses or sensibility'—and said\nthe opposite of what he really meant.</p>\n<p><em>Penultimate, noisome, wherefore</em> and <em>fulsome</em> are four\nespecially deceiving examples of words that don't look right,\nwords that don't mean what their appearance or sound\nwould have the unwary believe they do.  Here is a small quiz\nthat presents a dozen additional words whose form or sound\nis misleading.  Beware and be wary as you choose the correct\ndefinition for each entry.  Answers appear at the end of this\narticle.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>antebellum</em> a.  against women b.  against war\nc.  before the war d.  after the war.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>apiary</em> a.  school for mimics b.  place where apes are\nkept c.  place where bees are kept d.  cupboard for\npeas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>cupidity</em> a.  strong desire for wealth b.  strong desire\nfor love c.  obtuseness d.  love of amusement parks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>disinterested</em> a.  bored b.  lacking a bank account\nc.  restless d.  unbiased.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>enervated</em> a.  nervous b.  energized c.  weakened\nd.  cowardly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>forestress</em> a.  ancient hair style b.  stress on first part of\na word c.  female forester d.  dread anticipation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>friable</em> a.  easily crumbled b.  unhealthy c.  easily\nfried d.  relating to holy orders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>herpetology</em> the study of a.  herbs b.  herpes\nc.  female pets d.  reptiles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>inflammable</em> a.  calm b.  incredulous c.  not easily set\non fire d.  easily set on fire.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>meretricious</em> a.  falsely attractive b.  worthy\nc.  good-tasting d.  diseased.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>prosody</em> the study of a.  drama b.  music c.  prose\nd.  versification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>raze</em> a.  to burn with the sun b.  to lift up c.  to tear\ndown d.  to shear.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Taking a simplistic (there's another one!) approach to\nwords can generate bizarre results.  Once, after one of his\nmany luncheon speeches on the wonders and promises of\nrocketry and space flight, NASA scientist Wernher von\nBraun found himself clinking cocktail glasses with an adoring\nwoman from the audience.</p>\n<p>“Dr. von Braun,” she gushed, “I just loved your speech,\nand I found it of absolutely infinitesimal value!”</p>\n<p>“Well then,” von Braun gulped, “I guess I'll have to\npublish the speech posthumously.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yes!”  the woman came right back.  “And the sooner\nthe better!”</p>\n<p><em>ANSWERS TO THE QUIZ</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>c.</li>\n<li>c.</li>\n<li>a.</li>\n<li>d.</li>\n<li>c.</li>\n<li>b.</li>\n<li>a.</li>\n<li>d.</li>\n<li>d.</li>\n<li>a.</li>\n<li>d.</li>\n<li>c.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1></h1>",
