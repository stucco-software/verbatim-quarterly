Among the definitions\nare “a place for lovemaking,” “a marital relationship, with its\nrights and intimacies,” and “to have sexual intercourse with.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a3-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Anticipating a protest against the <em>AHD</em> and other dictionaries\nin 1976, Texas Education Commissioner Marlin\nBrockette stated that no works would be purchased that “present\nmaterial which would cause embarrassing situations or\ninterfere in the learning atmosphere in the classroom.”  By\nquoting that subsection of the Texas textbook adoption proclamation,\nCommissioner Brockette apparently justified the\nremoval of these five dictionaries from the purchase list in\nTexas: <em>the AHD, The Doubleday Dictionary, The Random\nHouse Dictionary of the English Language—College Edition,\nWebster's New World Dictionary—Students' Edition</em>, and\n<em>Webster's Seventh Collegiate Dictionary</em>.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a3-3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Commissioner Brockette's decision was reported in varous\nTexas newspapers on November 12, 13, and 14, 1976.\nFour months before he announced that the five dictionaries\nwould not be on the purchase list, Dr. Brockette received bills\nof particulars from various groups of citizens about the dictionaries\nthat had been submitted for adoption by the State of\nTexas.  Six of the cover letters which I have examined that accompanied\nthe bills of particulars cited these two subsections\nof the Texas textbook adoption proclamation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1.7  Textbooks offered for adoption shall not include\nblatantly offensive language or illustrations.</p>\n<p>1.8  Textbooks offered for adoption shall not present\nmaterial which would cause embarrassing situations\nor interference in the learning atmosphere of\nthe classroom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The chairperson of a textbook committee of a prominent\norganization of women wrote this about <em>Webster's New World\nDictionary of the American Language</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reviewer is shocked that a supposedly reputable publisher\nwould offer for adoption a book which is debasing\nthe English language.  Students need the basics\nrather than sub-standard language.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a5\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">5</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The chairperson of the organization's reviewing committee\nlisted these twelve words, among others, as examples of\nthe “objectionable material” she found in the dictionary:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>WORD</th>\n<th>REASON FOR OBJECTION</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>across-the-board</em></td>\n<td>Betting on horse racing in Texas is illegal.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>attempt</em></td>\n<td>Ties word into subject of murder.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>banana republic</em></td>\n<td>insulting to Latins</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>bawdy house</em></td>\n<td>unnecessary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>bed</em></td>\n<td>Why is sexual intercourse mentioned?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>the big house</em></td>\n<td>slang—unnecessary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>brain</em></td>\n<td>Definition denotes violence.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>bucket</em></td>\n<td>slang: the buttocks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>f</em></td>\n<td>Refers to a brothel (<em>claper</em>) and gonorrhea: slang.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>coke</em></td>\n<td>slang for cocaine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>crocked</em></td>\n<td>slang for intoxicated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>deflower</em></td>\n<td>to cause loss of virginity: slang?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Lovers of language and frequent users of dictionaries\nwould probably not consider these words to be “objectionable\nmaterial”; nor would they consider the following words,\nand/or specific definitions of them, to be “blatantly offensive\nlanguage”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>bastard</em><br>\n<em>easyrider</em><br>\n<em>fag</em><br>\n<em>fairy</em><br>\n<em>gay</em><br>\n<em>G-string</em><br>\n<em>head</em> (as in <em>acidhead</em>)<br>\n<em>john</em> (prostitute's customer)<br>\n<em>lay</em><br>\n<em>queer</em><br>\n<em>shack</em><br>\n<em>slut</em><br>\n<em>tail</em><br>\n<em>tail-end</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The removal of the five dictionaries from the purchase\nlist in Texas did not go unnoticed.  Several organizations concerned\nwith what is taught in the schools hailed the removal\nas a major victory.  One such organization noted<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a6\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a6\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">6</a></sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God gave parents a number of victories.  In Texas alone,\nthe State Textbook Committee did a good job of selecting\nthe best of the available books.  Then, the State\nCommissioner of Education removed 10 books, including\nthe dictionaries with vulgar language and unreasonable\ndefinitions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That statement was included in an announcement distributed\nby Educational Research Analysts in Longview,\nTexas.  Founded by Norma and Mel Gabler, ERA is billed as\n“the nation's largest textbook review clearing house,”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a3-4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup> providing\n“thousands of textbook reviews”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a3-5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup>\nthat “concentrate on pointing out 'questionable' content.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a4\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a4-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>A person concerned with specific words or definitions (or\nboth) in dictionaries can send a contribution to ERA and receive\ncopies of the bills of particulars that led Dr. Brockette to\nplace the five dictionaries on the no-purchase list.  A concerned\nperson can also request reviews of hundreds of textbooks.</p>\n<p>The ERA-distributed reviews concentrate on what's wrong\n—not with what's right—with textbooks and dictionaries.  Using\nsuch reviews as guidelines, concerned parents can underscore\n“objectionable” passages in textbooks and take the books\nto school board meetings to point out why children should not\nhave to study such works.  The concerned parents do not have\nto indicate the sources of the objections: rather, all they have to\ndo is get the ear of a sympathetic school board member and\nhope to get a book or dictionary removed from a public school.</p>\n<p>The tactic works.  Concerned citizens in a number of states\nhave used ERA-distributed reviews to complain about “objectionable”\nbooks that contain “blatantly offensive language.”\nFortunately, the critics of education are not always successful\nwith their attacks on books.  However, the victories are more\nand more frequent, and each victory gives the censors renewed\npurpose.</p>\n<p>As I write and speak about the new wave of censorship in\nthe public schools, I frequently ask myself, or I am asked, what\ncan be done to prevent the removal of dictionaries and textbooks\nfrom the schools.  Here are five steps that every person\ncan take:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Check the wording of the state's textbook adoption\nbill to make certain that the language in it does not permit\nthe removal of dictionaries and textbooks simply because\nthey contain a few words that some people would\nconstrue to be “blatantly offensive.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attend meetings of the school board (or school committee)\nand speak out, at appropriate times, for academic\nfreedom and the students' right to learn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attend state or local hearings on textbooks submitted\nfor adoption.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Form a local organization for the preservation of academic\nfreedom and the students' right to know.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write letters to newspaper and magazine editors protesting\nthe removal (or attempts at removal) of any books\nfrom the local schools.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h1></h1>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-a1\">\n<p><em>Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom</em>.
