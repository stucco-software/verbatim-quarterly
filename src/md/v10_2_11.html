<p><em><span data-rel="author">Walter Hayes</span> <span data-rel="location">Ann Arbor, Michigan</span></em></p>
<p>For twenty-eight years, from 1950 to 1978, I had a Partridge
every Christmas.  No postman was ever so eagerly
awaited as the one who would bring this annual reminder that
the old gentleman was alive and well and still contributing to
the wonder and wisdom of everybody who loved the English
language.</p>
<p>Many writers, printers and publishers have celebrated
Christmas with special editions, mostly ephemera, for their
friends.  Cambridge University Press did for some years.  Allen
Lane, founder of Penguin Books, gave up sending Christmas
cards in 1960 but more than made up for the omission the
following year when he wrote: “I have decided I will no longer
burden the Christmas mails with expressions of wit and
sentiment.  Instead of a card, I propose, as the spirit moves me
and the occasion warrants, to send a book or keepsake...”  In
1961, therefore, his friends received a limited edition of <em>The
Trial of Lady Chatterley</em>.</p>
<p>Chicago's excellent Lakeside Press began to send special
editions of the Lakeside Classics to their friends as long ago as
1902 and they are still going strong.</p>
<p>Eric Honeywood Partridge, the great lexicographer of his
long day one of the few fit to look Samuel Johnson in the
eye began his Christmas Partridges in 1927 and, except for
one year during the Depression and two or three during the
Second World War, continued until 1977, when the usual four-page
leaflet printed on heavy white card was replaced by a
smaller postcard and an apology.  Owing to the cost of printing
and envelopes, he explained, “I am regretfully obliged this year
and any others left to me, to send you a meagre postcard.”</p>
<p>He could not, however, give up the habit complely, and
the following year which was the last year of his life he sent
another small but more characteristic postcard with some
typical comments about his <em>Dictionary of Catch Phrases</em> which
“succeeded to a degree that surprised the publishers and 'more
than somewhat' startled me.”  He died on June 1, 1979, at 85
years of age.</p>
<p>His Christmas cards essays, extracts from books in progress,
commentaries on his published work were a marvelous
compendium of insight and autobiography and present a
revealing picture of an extraordinary man.</p>
<p>Eric Partridge was born on a sheep farm in New Zealand
in 1894.  He left school at sixteen to become a trainee teacher
in Australia, and won a scholarship to the University of
Queensland.  He joined the Australian infantry in April 1915
and served in Egypt, Gallipoli, and on the Western Front in
France.  In 1921 he went to Oxford and worked simultaneously
on two degrees.  After lecturing at the Universities of London
and Manchester, he gave up teaching to become a full-time
man of words.</p>
<p>Much as he hated the war he was never more than a
Lance Corporal he confessed that in his four fighting years he
learned more than in the rest of his life, and it was in the blood
and mud of Gallipoli that he first divined his future.</p>
<p>In one of his Christmas cards he wrote: “The fighting
services have always generated more slang than any other trade
or profession; they are, in a sense, closed corporations, vast and
human, grave and gay, commendable and reprehensible,
marked by a variety of activities and evoking an invincible
camaraderie.  From all walks of life and from all social,
educational, cultural levels, men intermingle, exchange ideas
and enrich one another in innumerable and incalculable ways.</p>
<p>In slang and colloquialism and catch phrase they find and form
a freemasonry of speech.  No school, no university, no civilian
trade or profession can begin to equal a fighting service as a
beneficent hotbed and an indirect developer of natural and
vivid speech.  In 1915 1918, I made not a single linguistic note;
verbal memory sufficed, mine happening to be fairly good.”</p>
<p>This freemasonry of speech began to enchant a wider
audience when he published <em>Songs and Slang of the British
Soldier</em> (with John Brophy) in 1930; <em>American Tramp and
Underworld Slang</em> (of which he was assistant editor) in 1931;
<em>Slang Today and Yesterday</em> in 1933 and <em>A Dictionary of Slang
and Unconventional English</em> in 1937.</p>
<p>Partridge went back to war when the Second World
conflict broke out and served another four years in the Army
and the Royal Air Force.  Out of these experiences came <em>A
Dictionary of R.A.F. Slang</em>, in 1945, and <em>A Dictionary of
Forces Slang</em>, in 1948.</p>
<p>My earlier Christmas cards from him have disappeared,
but I remember being astonished by these reminders of his
enormous output.  Johnson described a writer of dictionaries as
a “harmless drudge,” and perhaps it seemed so to him for he
was an indolent genius, but Partridge who never had a full-time
assistant did not make it seem so.  He also knew that, like
Johnson, he lived by the revenues of literature and he had
chosen to develop a branch of that great bank of knowledge
which pays small dividends.</p>
<p>The 1961 card, which is the earliest I still possess, again
discussed his torrent of work and three new books which had
come out that year: <em>The Smaller Slang Dictionary, Adventuring
Among Words</em>, and <em>Comic Alphabets</em>.  These, he observed,
“amount to nothing more imposing than opuscula, one of them
a parergon or, as the Anglo-Saxon fanatics would say, a by-work.”</p>
<p>In a piece written about Partridge in 1951 by Edmund
Wilson and titled “Eric Partridge The Word King,” Wilson
expressed the view that “one cannot help having the feeling
that Partridge has been overexpanding” and it was hard to
disagree.</p>
<p>Still, they had much in common.  For some years, Partridge
had suffered the same anxiety over the deterioration in
cultural standards that so concerned Wilson himself.  The moral
and intellectual disruptions of the war had brought about a
deterioration of literature and the arts, and Partridge's Christmas
card for 1966 reflected his anger.  It was actually a revised
version of an article he had written for <em>The New York Times
Book Review</em>, where it appeared on September 18, 1966, and
is, I think, the nearest he ever came to invective.  It was a
trenchant defense of everything he valued and a testimony to
everything he stood for.</p>
<p>He called it “The Envious Ones” and tilted his quill
against the levelers who feared superiority of mind and spirit.
Even worse, they envied it; therefore, they pretended to
despise it.  Lacking these qualities themselves, they could
neither admire them nor see their necessity in other people.</p>
<p>He concluded: “To degrade language is to degrade
civilization.”</p>
<p>The title of his 1967 Christmas card was “Tail Wagging
the Dog,” and it was an apology for having published no new
books that year.  There were two new editions of previous
works, and he did explain that for the third edition of <em>A
Dictionary of the Underworld, British and American</em> he had
completed a revision which included a mere 75,000 new words,
rather more American than British.  He had also revised that
small masterpiece, <em>Shakespeare's Bawdy</em>.</p>
<p>In 1968, he was back to autobiographical reminiscence in
a card entitled, “How did you come to write your <em>Dictionary
of Slang</em>?  Or, indeed, your <em>Usage and Abusage</em>?”</p>
<p>He explained that he was lucky with his parents.  Although
“only a farmer,” his father knew Greek and Latin and French
and spoke very “good” English.  He revealed that his father had
once quietly condemned him for devoting four years to a
subject so “shabby” as slang, and that it took him ten years to
admit that “perhaps I hadn't been so very wrong to do so.”  His
mother, he added, “always backed me up.”</p>
<p>In 1969, in a card called “Below The Surface,” he praised
T. S. Eliot and his friend and fellow finder-of-words, Christopher
Fry, for having turned poetry from stylized diction to
natural diction, loving the way that Fry was able to impart “an
agreeable colloquialism” to his poetic drama, and praising both
Kipling and Steinbeck for their ability to render “the technical
and difficult, non technical and easy.”  He had learned to call a
spade a spade and not a bloody shovel in the trenches of World
War I, and he remained in love with simplicity and directness
in language.</p>
<p>In 1973, Partridge reported at Christmas on perhaps the
most popular of his books which he had recently started
writing, <em>A Dictionary of Catch Phrases</em>.  For this, he read and
absorbed source material from the 1530s to the 1970s.  He
noted with favor Ring Lardner and Damon Runyon and Robert
Benchley.  “Those Americans,” he wrote, “who feel that Britain
is basically 'hostile' towards them might more wisely remember
that we in Britain and the Dominions have always welcomed
and enjoyed American humour.”</p>
<p>The following Christmas produced a further report on
<em>Catch Phrases</em>, and I was reminded how few people appreciate
the enormous amount of reading that is involved in
lexicography.</p>
<p>When he began to write <em>A Dictionary of Catch Phrases</em> in
September 1973, Partridge had devoted five years of reading to
this project alone and a month or so putting the entries into
alphabetical order.  His reading included Dickens and Noël
Coward, Will Rogers and <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p>
<p>The card of 1975 was a thank-you to all the correspondents
and friends who had helped with <em>A Dictionary of Catch
Phrases</em>.  They came from all over the world.  His American
correspondents included Professor Harold Shapiro of the University
of North Carolina, Norris Davidson, a retired Philadelphia
network commentator, and, inevitably a military man,
Colonel Albert Moe of the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p>My Christmas card for 1976 contained a handwritten
message.  For some time I had got into the habit of sending him
a bottle of champagne on his birthday, but I could never get
out of the habit of calling him “Mr. Partridge.”  This gaunt,
venerable Colonial could not have been more friendly, but I
always addressed him formally.  He shook me out of it in
typical fashion in his eightieth year.  On the card he wrote:
“Dear Walter, For heaven's sake, let's drop the Mister!!  Puts
years on me.  Eric.”</p>
<p>1977, as I have said, brought the Christmas letter cards to
an end and, perhaps because the cards ended, we corresponded
more frequently.</p>
<p>He always pretended never to expect the regular champagne.
In a note after his eightieth birthday, he wrote: “At
about noon today, Fortnum and Mason delivered a long
cylindrical mysterious parcel; and when I saw the name on the
delivery slip, I said, 'Well, I'm damned if you haven't sent me a
'commemorative!'  And so it was.  Now living in the home of
friends (my wife's in a nursing home, 3 yrs, 8 months now), I'll
share the bottle with 'em this evening.  Glad it came to-day, not
yesterday; they had 'laid on' an attractive evening for me; had
been given, by friends, a lunch at the Savile.  Bless you.  As
ever.”</p>
<p>The Savile Club in London, to which he was elected in
1950 and where I was sometimes bidden to dine, was one of
his four great places.  The other three were desk K1 at the
British Museum Library, Lord's cricket ground, and the Oval
cricket ground in London for cricket in summer was the only
thing that could get him away from his books and the only
form of holiday I ever knew him to take.</p>
<p>Only his body let him down.  The mind was still tickety-boo
to the end.</p>
<p>I still think of him often and especially at Christmas.
Peace on Earth and goodwill to all lexicographers still strikes
me as a splendid toast.  Champagne eventually exhausts its
bubbles, but Partridge left his behind.  There is nevertheless
something missing each December, and my ear, I suspect, is
less anxious for the postman's knock.  So won't somebody make
all those Partridges into a book?  1984 is his centenary year, and
would there by a better way to say Happy Christmas and
100th birthday at the same time?</p>
