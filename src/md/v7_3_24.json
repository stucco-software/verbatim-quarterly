Hollander, (Falcon Diversified Co., 1979), 46pp.</p>\n<p>This work firmly straddles two stools (not the pigeon\nkind) by providing what I assume to be useful text (I'm no\nornithologist, despise city pigeons, and prefer birds of the\nfeatherless biped variety) punctuated by sketches of <em>rarae\naves</em> like <em>night owls, young turks, no-left terns,</em> and other\noutrageous fauna. It would be best, for the serious (text)\nside of the book, to pick up the following from Hollander's\nprefatory notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It has been estimated by reputable taxonomists\nthat there are over 8000 species of birds in the world\ndespite man's heroic drive to make them extinct like\nthe dodo. Most of us see very few of these even at\nthe zoo. In addition, people who cultivate domestic\nbirds-poultry, pigeons, parakeets, canaries, etc.—\nhave created a multitude of breeds and varieties,\nwith proper names. The fanciers don't know the wild\nspecies, and the taxonomists don't know the “artificial”\nor man-made types. We have tried to bridge\nthe chasm a bit. Only a hint is provided, however,\nof the astounding adaptations in behavior, anatomy,\necology, and whatnot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The alphabetical list includes mainly common or\nnon-scientific terms except for Order names. After\nsuch terms come synonyms, then usually names of\nscientific genera (some probably out-of-date), and\nfinally an indication of world distribution.</p>\n<p>W. F. Hollander, Professor Emeritus of Genetics at\nIowa State University (Ames), has not let anyone forget his\nstate's reputation for corn. He certainly hasn't laid an egg\nwith this book, which you can buy for chickenfeed from\nThe Ink Spot, Burrton, Kansas 67020. It may leave you\n'owling with laughter or drive you cuckoo, all of which you\nwill agree are pretty cheep ways of selling something.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
