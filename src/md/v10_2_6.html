<p>In Italy recently, a friend who spoke a self-taught yet
passable basic English chided me for being <em>un neutro</em>, which
amused but puzzled me until he explained, “You have no sex in
your words.”  To an Italian, that is very important.  He was, of
course, correct in that English gave up, centuries ago, in one of
the most sensible moves the language ever made, gender
differentiation in all but a few of its nouns.  He felt the
language lacked an essential component, a “spiritual” side
even, having had the notion ingrained in his every mode of
thought since he heard his first word.  And he never questioned
the validity of this at-times confusing classification system.  It
just simply was, is, and probably always will be.  The peculiarities
of association it fostered never concerned him for one
moment.  Most of the European languages likewise have
retained this quirk, an irksome and seemingly unnecessary bane
to English speakers trying to fathom it and all the frustrating
grammatical acrobatics it entails.  Multifarious cultural conceptions
of sexuality or lack of it and gender assigned to objects
with or without animistic qualities, people in various stages of
growth or position, and abstract ideas formulated since the
preliterate dawn have baffled investigators since linguistic
science began.  But linguists cannot decide whether natural and
obvious sexual differences influenced grammatical gender or if
grammar in flux over centuries assigned arbitrary and sometimes
illogical labels as ideas changed.  Masculine assignations
are thought to have come from a perception of something as
active, mature, concrete, large; feminine as passive, weak,
quiet, small; neuter as inactive, general, indeterminate, impersonal.
Hundreds of nouns entered a gender categorization less
from their intrinsic active or passive, large or small, “male” or
“female” qualities than the way they came to be pronounced,
modified, and spelled, their final letters and suffixes the agents
that placed them in their destined slots.  Pursuers of knowledge
in the Romance languages (here only French and Italian will be
used as examples) usually find a satisfactory proportion of
agreement among the two-gender attributions bestowed by a
common Latin ancestry.  But let them plunge afterward into
three-gender German and their previous grudgingly accepted
notions turn topsy-turvy, and they surface crying for help.</p>
<p>To begin at the beginning, the words for “gender” and
“sex” themselves receive a more macho, Mediterranean emphasis
in masculine-oriented France and Italy, whereas in cooler,
maybe less assured Germany both words are conveniently
neuter to avoid argument.  But why a feminine “sexuality” in
all three tongues?  Perhaps in the deep primordial stirrings of
the unpredictable id a man should be attracted by it but dare
not display it.  German diminutives usually contract to a sexless
base.  Maidens are feminine by definition, including a German
<em>Jungfrau</em>, virginity intact; but let her be a <em>Mädchen</em> or <em>Fräulein</em>
not yet capable of reproducing herself and she finds her
femininity neuterized.  Likewise is a <em>Männlein</em> a 'little man' 
not even that.  Twain put his finger on it: “In German, a young
lady has no sex, while a turnip has.  Think what overwrought
reverence that shows for the turnip, and what callous disrespect
for the girl.”  Then she grows into a feminine <em>Frau</em>.
Hebrew absorbed German to form idiosyncracies of Yiddish,
but at least Yiddish abandoned Teutonic indifference in the
warm Semitic sensibility that made <em>mejdt</em> (from <em>Mädchen</em>)
feminine where it belonged.  A German capacity for motherhood
restores her femininity, but her female totality of <em>Frau</em>
and <em>Mutter</em> is lopsided.  The neuter “false friend” <em>das Weib</em>,
coguate with <em>wife</em>, has led more than one poor soul into
linguistic trouble.  (Some German-English dictionaries even add
to the problem.)  The current connotation is closer to 'broad'
than 'bride.'</p>
<p>Odder yet in Romance languages and in German is the
position of husbands or lovers if they sire a child “paternity”
is feminine in all three tongues.  To top that off, so are “virility”
and “manhood.”  German does have a second word for “manhood,”
but it takes the side of neuterdom.  Taking the distaff
side in German are, of all things: masculinity, maleness,
manliness, manly vigor, bravery, courage, manly dignity, man
and male collectively (<em>Mannsbild</em>), and a <em>Mannsperson</em>.  But
even women who have overstepped the bounds of socially
acceptable femininity have been unsexed by the language.  <em>Das
Mannweib</em>, an amazon or virago, is a neutered female.  Grammatical
<em>Maskulinum</em> and <em>Femininum</em> are both neuter.  The idea
of feminism is also neuter.  Even Vienna, that ineffably feminine
city, has been desexed into neuter <em>das Wien</em>.  Strange
people, those Germans.  But wait.  Across the border, French
masculinity is also feminine, while feminism is masculine
(likewise for both in Italy), and grammatical <em>feminin</em> is masculine.
To top this off, that ineluctably female part of the female
anatomy, the vagina, is masculine.  Strange people, those
French.  As if that were not enough, women in all three
countries carry their children in masculine uteri.  Androgynous
German women can have an alternate female womb.  And all
these children are conceived via eggs produced from masculine
ovaries (but in Italy an ovary can be bisexual).  And every
woman in Italy, France, and Germany wears a masculine
brassiere.  Strange people, all.</p>
<p>Italians sail feminine boats on a masculine sea full of
feminine water, Frenchmen masculine boats on a feminine one
(Where does the root of the difference lie, and why?), while
Germans in a neuter <em>Boot</em> can't make up their minds about
neuter water in large quantities.  Their thoughts larger than a
puddle range from manly “lake” <em>(der See)</em> to womanly “sea”
<em>(die See)</em> on the same word, masculine <em>der Ozean</em>, to neuter <em>das
Meer</em>, an all-encompassing hermaphroditic-neutero overview.
The French fly male airplanes through male air, Italians pierce
a male craft through female air, the indifferent Germans neuter
through unfulfilled female.  It begins to sound like a hetero-homo-bi
mixed-doubles invitational.</p>
<p>At table, on any masculine day of a feminine week in all
three tongues except for the Italian Sunday yanked into
femininity from such crass company, Romance cuts with
masculine knives, German with neuter (food for thought,
there); all three find female characteristics in a fork's prongs
(strangely, Spain sees them as phallic); French spoons are
rounded female forms, male for some reason in Italian and
German.  Masculine butter tops the same bread in France and
Italy; German feminine butter finds her efforts wasted on
neuter bread.</p>
<p>Twain again: “...In Germany a man may <em>think</em> he is a
man, but when he comes to look into the matter closely, he is
bound to have his doubts; he finds that in sober truth he is a
most ridiculous mixture; and if he ends by trying to comfort
himself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third
of this mess as being manly and masculine, the humiliating
second thought will quickly remind him that in this respect he
is no better off than any woman or cow in the land.”  His
mouth and feet are male, his nose and hands female, eyes and
ears neuter.  Romance finds feet and hands to be likewise, but
roving Romance eyes are all masculine.  Male hearts beat inside
male breasts in Italy and inside female French breasts, but
neuter hearts throb inside female breasts to the north.</p>
<p>These people of many parts all inhabit a feminine earth,
yet the French and Italians are close to masculine lands, the
Germans again undecided, even in <em>das Vaterland</em> and <em>das
Mutterland</em>, an atavistic idea so strongly feminine in Romance.
For this idea, Romance fights female battles for feminine glory
in ladylike wars, but Germany wages female battles for male
glory in masculine wars.  In peacetime, they all find protection
under the watchful eyes of matronly police forces manned by
virile cops.</p>
<p>Germany is unique in Europe in finding femininity in the
source of life, our sun, then in a recalcitrant, obtuse flurry of
confusion calls sunshine masculine and sunlight neuter.  Not far
behind, but on the other side of the looking glass, is Romance 
the great masculine ball of fire gives off a feminine shine.  To
further the muddle, Romance lovers spoon beneath a feminine
moon while less ardent German lovers again unique among
Europeans see only the man in it.  And to bring the ridiculousness
full circle, Romance moonshine is male, but Germany has
to have its night light and shine both confusing ways as before.</p>
<p>In the arts, what must a female singer feel like at the
realization that the operatic status she enjoys is a male one?
Not the parts written for her (excepting those few trouser
roles), but the range in which she sings them high sopranos
down through contraltos are all masculine.  In France, a
countertenor might feel all the more acutely the implied slur
that his vocal range has a certain prissiness to it, for <em>une haute-contre</em>
here is feminine.  So are Boris Godunov and Don
Giovanni, for that matter, for in France <em>une basse</em> is female,
<em>profondo</em> or not.  Black and white pianos are neuter, curved
violins womanly in Germany, but masculine in the others;
flutes are manly in Italy but feminine in the others.</p>
<p>Botticelli could never have painted <em>La Primavera</em>, so full
of gorgeous females in divers guises, in the exact manner he
did had he been born a Frenchman or German, both of whose
springtimes are of the male persuasion.  At least each language
agrees that winter is masculinely harsh, also autumn, time of
harvest but not of planting.  Summer is too, except in Italy,
where it can be torrid as a temptress.</p>
<p>None of the three can agree on much of the natural world,
either.  Male rain patters on a neuter German field; female rain
soaks male fields in France and Italy.  (Frenchmen protect
themselves from the elements with male coats, Italians with
female ones, while the Germans wear all three <em>der Mantel, die
Jacke, das Jackette</em>.)  France has two sexes of lightning and
thunder, Italy only two of lightning.  Male waterfalls cascade in
Germany, female in the two others; nothing cascades in a
female German desert or masculine French and Italian ones.
German mountains are male, not so in the other two; Italian
plains are male, not in the other two.  The feminine forests of
Italy and France can't compare to their masculine woods, vice-versa
in Germany; at least the upright trees in all of them are
male.  Even the stars in the all-masculine sky are different when
seen from femininely oriented Romance eyes and masculinely
based German ones.</p>
<p>And so it goes through those tongues of the world which
still insist the universe and all it contains can be viewed
according to an arcane system of categories and assigned their
places in the great cosmic scheme of things.  Even so, they can
come to virtually no agreement by what standards this should
be done, nor do they ever consult one another before doing so.
All languages give birth from the constant fecundity of new
ideas and things, but those with gender retention not only have
to decide what to name each new child but what sex to
proclaim it (or, in Germany, whether it even deserves a sex),
and who, really, has been granted or assumed the authority to
assign one?  Criteria differ not only over linguistic and national
borders but also within them, serving only to compound the
confusion.  So English, both American and British, with “no
sex” in its words, thank you, blithely goes its merry way,
keeping itself relatively simple in its verb structure and its
gender repudiation, not presuming to impose its views or
wishes upon those who have difficulty enough getting a grip on
this world.  It realized wisely a long time ago that if nobody can
agree on how the elements of creation might be winnowed and
pigeon-holed, maybe they ought not be winnowed at all.  Less
really is more.  Small wonder English is fast becoming the
standard communicator of the world.</p>
