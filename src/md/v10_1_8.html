<p>Credits</p>
<p>Remember the old days when movie credits told us who
produced the film, who wrote it, who directed it, who recorded
the sound, and who acted in it?  Even that was a bit more than
most of us wanted to know; but today, credits have taken on a
life of their own, and we are treated to a cornucopia of names
and titles rivaling the Manhattan telephone directory.</p>
<p>My wife and I saw <em>Sophie's Choice</em> a few weeks ago, and
when the final scene had faded and the credits started to roll,
we slowly rose and threaded our way across the row of raised
seats, then up the aisle, all the while looking back at the screen,
on which an interminable list of positions and the names of the
people who filled them was being projected at a reasonably fast
clip.  The names were still rolling as we left the theater.</p>
<p>A few days later, I thought it might be interesting to
investigate this phenomenon, so I called my friend Bert Freed,
who is on the executive committees of three separate branches
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  (Bert is
one of those many fine actors whose names are unfamiliar to
the average movie-goer, but whose work on stage, the big
screen, and the television screen is consistently excellent and
whose face you would surely recognize.)  He arranged to have
the Academy send me several of the official folders distributed
by the studios for the important preview showings of their
biggies.  Among the batch they sent were the credits for
<em>Sophie's Choice</em> and <em>E.T.</em></p>
<p><em>E.T.</em> is a dilly.  Not counting cast and stunt men, I figure
one hundred seventy-seven credits.</p>
<p><em>E.T.</em>, of course, is a special case, what with all the special
effects.  Nevertheless, the list includes the names of scores of
people who worked on the film who fifteen years ago wouldn't
have received screen credit and whose jobs could have been
done by anyone.  Now they're getting their names on the screen
in a sort of “egos-bustin'-out-all-over” display of publicity.  We
would certainly expect to be given the names of the producer,
director, writer, and actors.  We might reasonably expect the
names of the cinematographer and the editor; but the first
assistant editor?  the second assistant editor?  “E.T. Eyes
Design”?  “Matte Photography Assistant”?  What the hell is
that?</p>
<p>How about “Best Boy”?  As Laurence Urdang says,
“Sounds like a catamite!”  Having acted, with extraordinary
skill and a plethora of anonymity, in dozens of films, I've
known a few “best boys,” and most of them have been very
close to the time of life for Social Security.  A best boy is an
assistant, either to the gaffer, who is the head electrician, or
lighting man, or to the key grip, who is the head of the grips-the
grips being the guys who move equipment around a movie
set.  I asked Robert Wise, the producer and director (<em>Sound of
Music, West Side Story, The Sand Pebbles</em>, etc.), about the
specifics of “Best Boyhood,” and he said that the best boy is
not simply the first assistant to the gaffer or the key grip, but
the one who's in charge of maintaining the equipment.  A job
entailing considerable responsibility, surely, but hardly one
meriting space on a crawl, I should think.  The fact is that
probably no more than a dozen people in the universe give a
best boy's bum about who filled the position of gaffer, key grip,
lighting best boy, grip best boy, transportation captain, first
aid, or “Harvey's owner and trainer,” whatever the hell that
means.  (I suppose if I had the time, money, and strength to sit
through <em>E.T.</em> again, Harvey's identity would come back to me
in a flash, but you mustn't expect martyrdom.)</p>
<p>In the <em>E.T.</em> credits, they also list the “Dolly Grip.”  That's a
special category I'd never heard of, though I've seen many of
them.  They're not, as you might surmise, Barbie-holders, but
the guys who are skilled in moving the camera dolly at exactly
the pace the director has called for in a “dolly shot.”  It seems
to me like the sort of thing any idiot could do, but, never
having tried it, I could be quite wrong.</p>
<p>“Dolly Best Boy” would be an intriguing title, but the <em>E.T.</em>
bill doesn't list it as one.</p>
<p>“Script Girl” is a credit that used to raise leers and
chuckles among the lay audience.  I mean, everyone knew a
script girl was a lay for the director or the producer, right?</p>
<p>“Script-Girl” might have appeared as a credit on French
films before it did on American films.  I've seen “Script Girl” on
American films, but it was a short-lived credit on this side of
the Atlantic.  The feminist movement did it in.  The title is now
“Script Supervisor,” and I think it's about time.  The Script
Supervisor is now often a man.  And back in the days when a
script girl was a script girl, she was almost always a woman of
some maturity, however tender her years, and, unless the film
was a bad joke, she was someone of considerable competence.
I've worked on many a film in which the script girl contributed
infinitely more of value than the director.  The script girl is
usually responsible for making sure that dialogue, costume,
hairdo, facial smudges, and all the other essential minutiae
match from take to take, and the coordination of those
minutiae can mark the difference between a good scene and a
mess.</p>
<p><em>E.T.</em>, as everyone knows, was directed and produced by
Steven Spielberg.  Not everyone knows that it was also produced
by Kathleen Kennedy, and you'd be hard pressed to find
a man-in-the-street who knows or cares that the production
supervisor was Frank Marshall.</p>
<p>The reason I mention these folks is that their assistants
also get billing.  The Assistant to Mr. Spielberg was Janice
Pober; the Assistant to Ms. Kennedy was Denise Durham; and
the Assistant to Mr. Marshall was Patty Rumph.  This would
hardly be worth mentioning except that Robert Wise, who is
an old-timer, tells me that “Assistant to” is the latest term for
“Secretary to.”  He said he was on one of the major lots a few
months ago and he ran into a young woman whom he knew as
a fellow producer's secretary.  He introduced her to a friend as
“So-and-so's secretary” and was corrected on the spot.  “Assistant
!” said the young woman; “I'm his assistant!”  As his
assistant, she probably doesn't make any more money than she
would as his secretary, but at least she gets screen credit to
make her parents proud.</p>
<p>“DGA Trainee” is an interesting credit.  The DGA Trainee
on <em>E.T.</em> was a guy named John Flynn.  DGA is the Director's
Guild of America, and a DGA trainee is someone who gets
paid a minimum wage to hang around the set and sort of help
out.  Robert Wise tells me that they do things like showing
visitors around.  He says he was quite startled when, after a film
of his had been released, a DGA trainee wrote him to complain
bitterly that he hadn't received film credit.</p>
<p>I guess that tells us precisely what film credits are all
about.  They're not for the film-going public.  They're for the
people credited, who evidently get a kick out of seeing their
own names flash past fleetingly in a brief display of light and
shadow on a screen.  Talk about the bubble reputation!  This
one vanishes without a trace, and yet someone's ego has been
fed.  I think that must say something about something, but I'm
damned if I know what it is.</p>
