In each such chain,\nthe three linked words are roughly synonymous. But\na majority of them consist either of nonsense words\nor of fictional proper names. In the case of the nonsense\nwords, there may be a form spelled <em>-a-</em> (pronounced\nlike the final <em>a</em> in <em>sofa</em>) which is difficult, if\nnot impossible, to classify in terms of familiar affixes\nor parts of speech.</p>\n<p>A number of examples of word chains are shown\nin the table below.
