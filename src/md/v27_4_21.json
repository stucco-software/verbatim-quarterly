The reason for the four <em>l</em>'s is that the first two are at the end of a word (<em>drobwll</em>, 'whirlpool'), and the latter two <em>l</em>'s are at the beginning of the next word (<em>llan,</em> 'church').

The first is that Mr. Blackford makes the statement that “The small town in Wales was originally called <em>Llanfairpwllgwyn,</em> which meant 'St.Mary's Pool of the White Haze'' In fact, a translation of <em>Llanfairpwllgwyn</em> should contain the word 'church' (<em>llan</em>), and there is no mention in Welsh of any 'hazel'. Historically speaking, the correct original name of the village was <em>Llanfairpwllgwyngyll</em>—which does include the 'hazels'(<em>gyll</em>— the plural of hazel).</p>\n<p>The author also mentions that the original name “was lengthened by a cobbler who wanted to pinpoint further its location near St. Tsylio's church and a red cave.” This explanation is true but incomplete. It represents a significant omission because of the existence in the full name of <em>gogerychwyrndrobwll</em> 'close to the fierce whirlpool' the inclusion of which is not mentioned. Finally, a small point , but the name of the saint should be spelled <em>Tysilio</em> (not <em>Tsylio</em>).</p>\n<p>A loose translation of the entire name would be something like this: <em>(Saint) Mary's church by the pool of the white hazels close to the fierce whirlpool by(Saint) Tysilio's church near the red cave.”</em></p>\n<p><em>[T.L.
