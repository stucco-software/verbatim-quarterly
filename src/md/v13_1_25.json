Hobbs, (McFarland &amp; Company, 1986), viii + 264pp.</p>\n<p>I have had occasion to use books similar in subject\nmatter to this one and have in my library many of\nthose listed in the Bibliography.  My general criticism\nof some of them is that they do not cover the language\nthoroughly.  It would appear, from those few that are\ncomprehensive (like the work at hand), that there are\nabout 3,500 homophones, about 600 homographs, and\nabout 100 words that are both.  Yet some of the books I\nhave seen list only a fely a hand of the first, which\nseems to me too casual a treatment of the subject to\nmake the result worthwhile.  My other criticism of\nmost of the other books is that their organization is\npoor and interferes with the best uses to which such\nbooks can be put.</p>\n<p>Hobbs, who teaches at Lehigh University, in\nPennsylvania, has done quite a thorough job of it,\nbeginning with a discussion of the meanings of <em>homophone,\nhomograph, homonym</em>, ... and a few rare\nalternatives.  He then goes on to discuss, albeit briefly,\nhow languages deal with homophones (especially): the\nanswer is that ambiguity seldom arises because most\nhomophones (and, for that matter, homographs) are\ndistributed differently in the language—that is, <em>oar</em> and\n<em>ore</em>, though both nouns, are rarely confused because\nthey occur in quite different contexts; neither is likely to\nbe confused with <em>or</em>, which has a different grammatical\ndistribution.</p>\n<p>There follows a dictionary of homophones of 217\npages, well laid out, easy to use, and thoroughly cross-referenced.\nBeginning on page 220 there is a 30-page\ndictionary of homographs.  Appendix I consists of several\nlistings—“Unusual Groupings”—of four or more\none-syllable homophones (note <em>air, are, e'er, ere, err,\neyre,</em> and <em>heir</em>), three or more two-syllable words, and\nso forth, as well as a list of words (like <em>mole</em>) that are\nboth homographs and homophones.  Appendix II is a\nshort annotated Bibliography.</p>\n<p>Homophones may cause one kind of ambiguity,\nbut homographs cause another, and, till relatively recent\nadvances in parsing systems for computer processing\nof natural language, they made machine translation\nsomething less than successful.  A word like <em>axes</em>,\nfor instance, was indistinguishable as the plural of <em>ax</em> or\nof <em>axis; lead</em> can be a metal or a verb, and so on.</p>\n<p>Hobbs's book is a very useful one—at least for lexicographers,\nother linguists, and writers of readers for\nthose learning English, either as a native or a foreign\nlanguage.  Inevitably, I have some criticism: loanwords,\nsome of which have a high frequency in English, seem\nto have been either overlooked or deliberately omitted\n(I cannot tell which), so one doesn't find <em>lox</em> 'smoked\nsalmon'/'liquid oxygen,' <em>or</em> 'gold' and <em>d'or</em> '(made) of\ngold,' etc., though <em>piqué, coupé, bouché</em>, and other\nitems are listed.  These are not vital, but one would\nhope to see them included in a second edition.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
