There is\nno arguing with taste, but even those who support the\nsecond tenet must admit that if researchers felt that\nway about cancer, syphilis, and AIDS, there would not\nbe much point to research at all.  It is unlike Dr. Aman\nto cloak his subject—dirty language—under the euphemism\n“verbal aggression”: he and most of the authors\nof the articles appearing in <em>Maledicta</em> let it all\nhang out; some, however, tuck it away neatly and\nwrite under a pseudonym.  (And everyone should now\ntake a few minutes to ponder the meaning of <em>it</em> in the\npreceding sentence.)</p>\n<p>Not all of verbal aggression is concerned with\nfour-letter words; much of it (and many of the four-letter\nwords) involves insults, racist and other prejudicial\nlanguage, and other parts of the nether reaches of\nlanguage formerly represented largely by asterisks.  (I\nhave often wondered why the publishers did not have\nthe nerve to call themselves “F**k and Wagnalls.”)  To\nignore it is plainly wrong; all the reasons that can be\nadduced for ignoring it are compelling testimony to its\nimpact, and anything with such impact cannot—must\nnot—be dismissed as unimportant.  Contrary to popular\nbelief, the point of studying verbal aggression is not\nto modify or ameliorate or eliminate it—serious scholars\nconsider it bad form to tamper with the evidence—but\nto describe and codify it, much as investigators\nhave tried to do with all other available\nphenomena, whether natural or artificial, whether in\npure or physical or social science.  To quote in part\nfrom what may be termed its “statement of purpose,”\n“<em>Maledicta</em> specializes in uncensored studies and glossaries\nof offensive and negatively valued words and\nexpressions, from all languages and cultures, past and\npresent.”</p>\n<p>The present volume, only one year in arrears,\nincludes an interview by Aman with Lillian Mermin\nFeinsilver, an authority on Yiddish and author of <em>The\nTaste of Yiddish</em>.  At the end of the interview is a good\nbibliography of Feinsilver's work.  It should be noted\nthat interviews are quite rare in such journals, and it is\ncertainly unusual to find a linguist humanized by such\na device.  Although the interview suffers from a number\nof faults—for instance, it is not penetrating or\nthorough enough, probably because Aman is a better\nscholar, writer, and editor than interviewer, and it\ncontains gratuitous information about the interviewer\nwho cannot resist blowing his own horn—it is at least\nan attempt at documenting that has not, to my knowledge,\nbeen done before in the field of linguistics.  Perhaps\nAman will sharpen his perspective and techniques\nand institute such interviews as a regular\nfeature of <em>Maledicta</em>.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Feinsilver has an interesting article in this\nvolume, too, “Comment on Aman's 'A Yiddish Minnie-Legend'\nand the Romanization of Yiddish.”  Other articles\ninclude “Is George Bush a <em>Wimp</em>?,”  “The Moving\nSpray Can” (on graffiti in England), “On the Pronunciation\nof <em>Cunnilingus</em> in Dictionaries,” and numerous\nothers on a wide variety of subjects; these are interspersed\nwith short bits and pieces, cartoons, and asides\ngenerally attributed to “Folklore” and, presumably,\ngathered by the editor.  Although the subject matter\nmight be viewed as an area of legitimate investigation,\nI am not sure I see the point in employing the subject\nstyle of language in the descriptive text, which would\nbe far more telling were it restricted to the language of\nthe linguistic clinician.  Aman evidently disagrees, for\nhis writing is peppered (salted?) with references like\n“every asshole with access to a typewriter.”  It is many\nyears since my contemporaries and I got a kick out of\nseeing even the bowdlerized <em>f**k</em> in print (in Partridge's\n<em>Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English</em>,\n1935), and <em>fug</em> in Mailer's <em>The Naked and the\nDead</em> allowed prudery to mock itself.  But the power of\nwords is such that I contend their impact is totally lost\nif not treated clinically: somehow, there is a difference\nbetween “Someone had written <em>shit</em> on the wall” and\n“Some asshole had written <em>shit</em> on the wall”: the writer\nof the former has more credibility; the writer of the\nlatter was, very likely, the very asshole who had written\n<em>shit</em> on the wall.</p>\n<p>These are minor quibbles.  <em>Maledicta</em> is instructive,\nfunny, gross, informative, vulgar, impolite, and\nsometimes well written.  I am afraid that an adjective\nlike <em>penetrating</em> is not only a bit strong but would be\nlikely to be adopted as a slogan by the editor.  I do\nthink that Aman contributes something important to\nthe linguistic literature, and I think he ought to view a\nbit more seriously (and less rancorously) the opportunities\naccorded him by his experience with these powerful,\nprivate parts of the language to pursue a theme\nof analysis of its impact and why and how it carries so\nmuch weight, both denotatively and connotatively.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<p>[Note: <em>Maledicta</em> is available by annual subscription\nfrom Maledicta Press, 331 South Greenfield Avenue,\nWaukesha, WI 53186, USA.  It costs US$25 a year; back\nissues are available as are several books, none expensive.]</p>\n<h1></h1>",
