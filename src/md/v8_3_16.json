He wrote the following, with the request\nthat the master of ceremonies use it without making any\nchanges: “Ladies and Gentlemen, I bring you a man\namong men.  He is out of place when among cheaters\nand scoundrels.  He feels quite at home when surrounded\nby persons of integrity.  He is uncomfortable\nwhen not helping others.  He is perfectly satisfied when\nhis fellow human beings are happy.  He tries to make\nchanges in order for this country to be a better place.  He\nshould leave us this evening with feelings of disgust at\nineptitude and a desire to do better.  I present to you Mr.\nJohn Smith.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Smith or his secretary made a\nnumber of errors in punctuation, so that the master of\nceremonies found himself reading the following:\n“Ladies and Gentlemen, I bring you a man.  Among\nmen, he is out of place.  When among cheaters and\nscoundrels, he feels quite at home.  When surrounded by\npersons of integrity, he is uncomfortable.  When not\nhelping others, he is perfectly satisfied.  When his fellow\nhuman beings are happy, he tries to make changes.  In\norder for this country to be a better place, he should\nleave us this evening.  With feelings of disgust at ineptitude\nand a desire to do better, I present to you Mr. John\nSmith.”</p>\n<p>This story, which so vividly illustrates the importance\nof proper punctuation, is not my creation.  It is a\nreconstruction of something I read or heard as a high\nschool student, several decades ago.  I would appreciate\ninformation from readers of <em>Verbatim</em> concerning the\nidentity of the story's originator, so that I can duly credit\nhim or her when the occasion next arises.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
