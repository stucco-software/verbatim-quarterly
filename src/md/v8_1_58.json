Ah yes: a lie.”</p>\n<p>Spying naturally requires cover, or disguise: candor\nis a small virtue in espionage.  Espionage may also\nrequire euphemism.  <em>Euphemism</em>, according to the\n<em>Oxford English Dictionary,</em> comes from the Greek verb\n'to speak fair' and is 'the substitution of a word or\nexpression of comparatively favourable implication or\nless unpleasant association, instead of the harsher or\nmore offensive one that would precisely designate what\nis intended.'  When one 'speaks fair,' one uses vague,\nimprecise, indirect, frequently polysyllabic, and always\nmisleading language.</p>\n<p>Euphemism in spying, however, seems paradoxical,\nsince so many examples of failed euphemisms (<em>protective\nreaction</em> for 'bombing raid,' <em>surreptitious entry</em> for\n'breaking and entering') suggest that euphemism is\ntranslucent, if not transparent: it holds its cover only\ntemporarily.  Why, then, should the spies—with their\nsophisticated and potent array of invisible inks, cryptograms,\nscramblers, lie detectors, and poison dart guns—\nbother to use the frail euphemism?</p>\n<p>Literature about the United States Central Intelligence\nAgency suggests that the euphemisms are coined\nnot to mislead the enemy but to soothe the conscience\nof the spy and to guide public opinion.  An example of\neuphemism as a kind of Maalox for the conscience of the\nspy appears in <em>The Man Who Kept the Secrets</em> (1978),\nThomas Powers's biography of Richard Helms.  Powers\ntells of a major in Castro's army recruited by the CIA to\nassassinate the Cuban leader.  The major had already\nshown his prowess by killing Batista's head of military\nintelligence.  After the killing, however, he had a nervous\nbreakdown.  In his later negotiations with the CIA,\nhe refused to use the word <em>assassinate</em>; he preferred\n<em>eliminate</em>.</p>\n<p>Euphemism has a more public purpose as well.  A\nformer CIA officer, John Stockwell, reveals in <em>In Search\nof Enemies</em> (1978) that as the word <em>mercenary</em> became\nembarrassing in CIA Angola, the agency simply banned\nthe word from memos and reports.  The replacement\nterm was <em>foreign military advisor</em>.  Similarly, William\nColby, in <em>Honorable Men</em> (1978), explains that he took\nthe agency's poison dart gun before the Church Committee\nto dispel the CIA's “James Bond” and “Maxwell\nSmart” image.  He therefore introduced the weapon to\nthe committee not as a poison dart gun but as a <em>Non-discernible\nMicrobioinoculator</em>.</p>\n<p>This deceptive quality of euphemism contrasts to\nthe more candid possibilities of jargon.  Although jargon\nmay be euphemistic, it does not have to be.  Both jargon\nand euphemism are indirect and cryptic, but euphemism\nconceals and begs for belief, while jargon may\nfunction precisely as shop talk or insider's shorthand.\nNo spy talking to another spy would call a poison dart\ngun a <em>Non-discernible Microbioinoculator</em>.  John le\nCarré's spies, however, call a bodyguard a <em>babysitter</em>.\n<em>Babysitter</em> is oblique to the outsider, but, once its new\nmeaning is understood, precise.  Similarly, <em>to burn</em> is spy\njargon meaning 'to blackmail' but is a more revealing\nexpression than <em>political action</em>.  Thus, jargon may be a\nuseful linguistic device in a specialized trade.  <em>Cold\npitch</em>, for instance, is CIA jargon for 'approaching a\npotential agent on the street without any introduction.'\nSometimes such jargon is quite candid: 'sabotage\ninstructors' at the CIA training school are known as <em>the\nburn or blow boys</em>.  When Trevanian, in <em>The Eiger\nSanction</em>, ridicules such “cryptic jargon” as <em>demote\nmaximally</em> for 'purge by killing,' <em>biographic leverage</em> for\n'blackmail,' <em>sanction</em> for 'counter-assassination,' and <em>wet\nwork</em> for 'killing,' he is parodying such CIA euphemisms\nas <em>terminate with extreme prejudice</em>.  Only <em>wet\nwork</em>, with its menacingly clear understatement, is\njargon.  Of course, spy jargon is a more private language\nthan spy euphemism, but literature about the CIA provides\nmany more examples of distorting euphemism\nthan of candid jargon.</p>\n<p>Euphemisms appear throughout the world of the\nCIA.  According to Victor Marchetti, in <em>The CIA and the\nCult of Intelligence</em> (1974), the CIA calls its spies\n<em>penetrations</em>, an impersonal word that connotes a kind\nof objective, perhaps inevitable, physical phenomenon\nand avoids the sneaky connotation of <em>spy</em>.  A <em>technical\ninterview</em> is the 'lie detector test given to prospective\nCIA employees.'  <em>Technical penetration</em> is the public-relations\nterm for 'electronic surveillance, or bugging.'\nAccording to E. Howard Hunt's <em>Undercover</em> (1974), <em>alias\ndocumentation</em> is the CIA euphemism for the 'making of\nfalse identity papers and disguises.'  A dazzling euphemism\nis the Orwellian <em>authentication</em>, which means\n'forgery.'  Here euphemism has become Doublespeak.</p>\n<p>For the sake of public relations, a CIA front\nbecomes a <em>proprietary organization</em>.  The 'secret use of\nfoundations, newspapers, and colleges'—where the CIA\nmay employ <em>campus sources</em>, or 'informers'—becomes\nan <em>interface</em>.  'Propaganda' becomes <em>disinformation\nactivities</em>; 'giving a secret CIA assignment to a reporter'\nbecomes <em>prior tasking</em>.</p>\n<p>One of the best known CIA euphemisms is <em>covert\naction</em>.  The phrase connotes merely a 'secret action,' but\nin fact refers to the 'secret intervention in the internal\naffairs of foreign countries.'  According to the June 1980\nissue of the <em>Covert Action Bulletin</em>, even this bland\nterm is being replaced by the blander <em>special activities</em>.\nA rather extreme form of covert action is <em>destabilization</em>,\nor the 'overthrow of a foreign government.'</p>\n<p>Much of this spy talk is so euphemistic that it\nsucceeds in suggesting the board room rather than the\nhidden microphone.  Just as business favors action-oriented\nexpressions (as Kenneth Hudson points out in his\n<em>Dictionary of Diseased English</em>) like <em>aggressive manager</em>\nand <em>fast-moving convenience foods</em>, the CIA relies\non aggressive business expressions for cover.  <em>Political\naction</em> means the 'bribing of foreign politicians or the\nframing of Soviet officials.'  <em>Executive action</em> means\n'assassination of heads of state.'  According to Harry\nRositzke, in <em>The CIA's Secret Operations</em> (1977), <em>preventive\ndirect action</em> means 'sabotage, anti-sabotage,\nand demolition.'  <em>Positive intervention</em> is an 'attempt to\nunseat a Communist government.'</p>\n<p>To the public, the Central Intelligence Agency is\nthe CIA; to its employees, the CIA is <em>the firm</em> or <em>the\ncompany</em>.  Given this logic, the 'relationship between\nthe spy and his handler' becomes the <em>agent-principal\nrelationship</em>, 'foreign nationals working for the firm'\nbecome <em>assets</em>, 'areas of specialization' become <em>accounts</em>\n(as in <em>the Iranian account</em>), and 'casing the office of\nDaniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist' becomes a <em>feasibility\nstudy</em>.  For employees who displease their superiors, the\nfirm may, in the words of William Colby, <em>arrange a\ncircumstance where employees can be helped to leave\ngovernment service early</em>.  If the employee is one of\nthose purged in the CIA's recent mole hunts, the dismissal\nis called a <em>negative career development</em>.</p>\n<p>Since a democratic society holds its intelligence\nservices accountable to the people, the CIA often makes\nplans for <em>plausible deniability</em> (a 'lie that the President,\nCongress, the press, or the public will buy'), but it may\nhave to fall back on <em>distancing</em> ('stonewalling').</p>\n<p>Euphemism, in short, does not really keep the\nsecrets, but—through the manipulation of language—\nhelps make some CIA practices seem more respectable.</p>",
