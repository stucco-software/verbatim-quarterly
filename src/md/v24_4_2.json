Our daily toil resulted in the production by each airman of a Technical Summary of activity, which was submitted at day's end for analysis.</p>\n<p>These Technical Summaries became known, not surprisingly perhaps, as “Techsums.”</p>\n<p>On one delicious occasion our Commanding Officer, who arguably should have known better, felt it necessary to post a notice for all to see which read:</p>\n<p>“In the future completed techsa are to be filed by 23.59 hrs.”</p>\n<p>Thank you for VERBATIM, it is a joy to read.</p>\n<p><em>[Roger N.
