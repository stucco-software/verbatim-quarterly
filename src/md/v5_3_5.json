Am I alone in objecting to some\ntrained speaker deliberately breaking a rhyme, as if to show\nthat he or she knows better than Chaucer, Shakespeare, and\nDonne?</p>\n<p>It is quite clear that the word, in ordinary speech, may\nbe pronounced AGANE or AGEN.  With one exception, every\ndictionary I have consulted gives both pronunciations.  The\nexception is a recent edition of <em>Cassell's New English Dictionary</em>,\nwhich gives only A'GAN.</p>\n<p>The word is of Anglo-Saxon origin, two spellings being\ngiven in the <em>OED</em>: <em>ongean</em> and <em>ongaegn</em>.  The latter is\nrecognizable in the modern German <em>entgegen</em> 'against, contrary\nto, towards,' and in fact the word, in its earlier usages,\nwas both a preposition and an adverb, with several meanings,\nincluding 'again, against, towards and in return.'  This\nlast is still found occasionally, as in A.E. Housman:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ah, let not only mine be vain,<br>\nFor lovers should be loved again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I am certain that that great precisionist intended a true\nrhyme and did not reckon on being “corrected” by some radio\nelocutionist.</p>\n<p>Amongst the spellings recorded in dictionaries are:\n<em>again, againe, agayn, agayne, agein, ageyn, agane</em> and <em>agen</em>.\nOnly the last seems to offer any support to the modern\ndogma, unless the pronunciation of the other spellings has\nchanged over the centuries.  What evidence have we as to how\na word was pronounced in the past?  It seems to me that\nrhyme is the strongest evidence, if the spelling cannot be accepted.\nLet us see how poets, from the beginning of English\nrhyme, have chosen to rhyme <em>again</em>.  (With the earliest examples,\nthe rhyming word and the spelling are given.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>RHYMED WITH main RHYMED WITH men</em></p>\n<p>14th century:</p>\n<p>Robert Mannyng—<em>seyn ageyn</em></p>\n<p><em>Gawain—again/fain</em></p>\n<p>Chaucer—<em>agayn/slayn certayn/Alain/</em></p>\n<p><em>ageyn/certeyn/seyn/pleyn/again/sain/\nslain/fain</em></p>\n<p>15th century:</p>\n<p>Dunbar — <em>paine/againe</em></p>\n<p>Henryson — <em>agane/certaine</em></p>\n<p>Border Ballads:</p>\n<p><em>The Nut-brown Maid—twain/again</em></p>\n<p><em>Chevy Chase—slaine/againe</em></p>\n<p><em>Cospatrick—breast-bane/again</em></p>\n<p><em>Lord Thomas—nane/againe</em></p>\n<p><em>Lament of the Border Widow</em>—\n<em>again/slain</em></p>\n<p>16th century:</p>\n<p>Spenser, Surrey, Marlowe, Greene, Wyatt</p>\n<p>16th-17th centuries</p>\n<p>Shakespeare, Beaumont, Chapman, Webster, Donne, Dowland, Campion, Quarles\nDrayton, Drummond, Fletcher</p>\n<p>Ben Jonson — <em>vaine/again</em><br>\nBen Jonson — <em>men/agen</em></p>\n<p>Cowley, Marvell, Dryden, Herrick, Crashaw, Henry King, Sedley,\nTraherne, Milton, George, Herbert</p>\n<p>17th-18th centuries:</p>\n<p>Prior, Ambrose Philips, Swift</p>\n<p>18th century:</p>\n<p>Pope, Gray, Cowper, Burns</p>\n<p>18th-19th centuries:</p>\n<p>Campbell, Coleridge, Wordsworth</p>\n<p>19th century:</p>\n<p>Shelley, Hood, Browning, W.E. Henley (spelt <em>agen</em>), Fitzgerald, Wm. Morris, Rossetti, G.M. Hopkins, Patmore, Arnold, Carroll,  Darley, Francis Thomson, Stevenson, Longfellow, Tennyson, Keats</p>\n<p>19th-20th centuries</p>\n<p>Bridges, Kipling, Housman, Housman, Hardy\nHardy</p>\n<p>20th century</p>\n<p>Flecker, R Brooke, W.H. Davies, D.H. Lawrence,\nEzra Pound, Walter de la Mare, Walter de la Mare, W.B. Yeats</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It will be seen that, in my random browsing, I have\nfound no example of a <em>men, pen</em> rhyme earlier that Chapman\nand Ben Jonson, and it is highly significant that Jonson spells\nthe word according to the rhyme: <em>vaine/again, men/agen</em>.\nFrancis Quarles also spells it <em>agen</em> to rhyme with <em>when</em>.</p>\n<p>Ben Jonson is the earliest of the small number of poets\nwho sometimes use <em>rain/pain</em> rhymes and sometimes <em>men/pen</em>\nrhymes.  The proportion of the latter increases in the 19th century,\nand it may be that the dogma dates from then.  But\nwhy?  It is inconceivable that the vast majority of poets were\nusing false rhymes.  It is equally incredible that all the rhymed\nwords have changed their pronunciation.  Who could argue\nthat <em>fain</em> was ever pronounced as <em>fen, pain</em> as <em>pen, ta'en</em> as\n<em>ten</em>, or <em>main</em> as <em>men</em>?  (Chaucer rhymes <em>men</em> with <em>hen</em>).</p>\n<p>My own conclusion is that <em>again</em> was pronounced AGANE\nin common speech, as in verse, by the majority of English-speaking\npeople over the centuries.  In every case the apparent\nintention of the poet should be respected when speaking his\nverse, varying the pronunciation according to the rhyme.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
