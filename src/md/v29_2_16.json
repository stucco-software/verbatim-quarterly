Thanks, Boss, for inspiring this essay.</p>\n<p><em>Y,</em> the third shortest letter, after <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em>, occupies pages 681–788 in the 1989 <em>OED's</em> final volume; cf. Simon Winchester, <em>The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the OED</em> (Oxford, 2003), pp. 214, 230, for the history of this particular material.</p>\n<p>Dr. Johnson, thanks to lavish quotations, found it six pages (Arno Press repr., New York, 1979), observing, “<em>Y</em> was much used by the Saxons.” The first mention of it is indeed in <em>Aelfric's Grammar</em> (2.5, c. AD 1000).</p>\n<p>Bede derives <em>Yule,</em> the only <em>Y</em>-word in Jeffrey Kacirck's 2004 <em>Forgotten English Calendar,</em> from Anglo-Saxon <em>hweol</em> 'wheel.' A glance at (e.g.) my Albanian, French, German, Italian, and Romanian dictionaries yielded similar shortages.</p>\n<p>This paucity is explained by corresponding classical dearth. In Greek, <em>Y</em> is capital <em>U.</em> No Latin word begins with it, the letter being reserved for lower-case transliterations from foreign ones: “Romans have no need of <em>Y</em>” (Terentianus Maurus, <em>On Letters, Syllables, Metres,</em> v.247).</p>\n<p>No <em>Y</em> ones in Ivor Brown's <em>Chosen Words</em> (1961). Only four in Anthony Burgess's <em>Clockwork Orange</em> (1962): <em>yahzick</em> 'tongue,' and <em>yeckate</em> 'to drive,' Russian-derived; <em>Yahoodies</em> 'Jews,' and <em>yarbles</em> 'testicles' not. Despite listing <em>Clockwork Orange</em> as a source, the <em>OED</em> omits these.</p>\n<p>Initial signs include <em>Y-fronts,</em> mathematical <em>Y,</em> genetic chronosome <em>Y,</em> and the <em>Y</em> used by collectors of <em>Plusia</em> (a species of moths). The <em>OED</em> goes from <em>ya</em> to <em>ywrought,</em> Johnson from <em>yacht</em> to <em>yux</em> 'hiccough,' (not in the <em>OED</em>). From the common <em>(year, yellow, yes, yesterday, you/your)</em> to multilingual exotic <em>yabba</em> 'large Jamaican cooking-pot,' <em>yabber</em> (Australian Aboriginal) 'to talk', <em>yakamite</em> 'a South American bird,' and <em>yamstchick</em> (Russian) 'post-horse driver.'</p>\n<p>Onomatopoeic terms prosper: <em>yaw-yaw</em> 'to talk effectively' (Dickens 1854—cf. Churchillian <em>jaw-jaw</em>); <em>yap/yip/yelp</em> (mainly of dogs); <em>yow/yowl</em> (feline); <em>yex,</em> 'belch' (1629); <em>yoop,</em> 'convulsive sobbing' (1848); <em>yike</em> 'the woodpecker's call' (1891); <em>yoicks,</em> the fox-hunting call, imminently illegal in Britain; <em>yah</em> 'pseudo-phonetic representations of House of Commons ejaculations' (1886), reborn as a 1980s Yuppie affirmative.</p>\n<p>Likewise, words based on proper names: <em>Yale;</em> <em>Yapp,</em> 'a style of bookbinding in limp leather' (1882); <em>Yarborough,</em> 'hand containing no card above a nine'—cf. Bond's trick bridge hand in <em>Moonraker; Yarmouth,</em> 'herring' (c. 1660); various terms based on <em>Yorkshire,</em> including the cricketing <em>Yorker</em> 'ball that pitches under the bat' (1870). <em>Yorkshire</em> itself I once heard used on <em>Are You Being Served?</em> to denote testicles.</p>\n<p><em>Yerk</em> (1520) takes the versatility prize: 'to draw stitches tight'; 'to crack a whip', 'to fling heels', 'to carp at.' Johnson adds 'to throw out, or moves with a spring.' His <em>Y</em>s embrace <em>yellowboy</em> 'a gold coin,' dubbing it “a very low word” (it comes from John Wilson's 1662 play <em>The Cheats</em>), also <em>youthy</em> 'young, youthful. A bad word' (1712; cf. Scott's “a withered beauty who persists in looking youthy”).</p>\n<p>Speaking of <em>yellow,</em> one of seventeen words—none sexual, save <em>yellow cats</em> (whores who frequented the Strand's Golden Lion brothel) in Grose (1796)—is <em>yellow-belly</em>: 'A native of the Lincolnshire fens: an allusion to the eels caught there.' That comforts myself, a Lincolnshire man: the sobriquet is modernly taken to indicate cowardice. Grose also has <em>Yorkshire tyke</em> 'a cheat.'</p>\n<p><em>Y</em> words fill six pages of the <em>Dictionary of the Underworld</em> (1950, by Grose's editor and successor, Eric Partridge), where <em>Y</em> is a verb for 'double-cross' (“I plugged him when he <em>y</em>-ed me,” Howard Rose, 1934), and <em>YMCA</em> is American tramps' 1931 acronym for “You Must Come Across” (sc. with the money)—Did the Village People know that?</p>\n<p>Reviewing (<em>TLS,</em> Dec. 10, 1993) the <em>New Shorter Oxford</em> (which is now the old <em>New Shorter Oxford,</em> a new edition having come out last year), David Nokes remarks, “A surprisingly high number of slang terms begin with a <em>y</em>, suggesting a fondness for childlike (or tabloid) phonetics: along with <em>yuppie,</em> there is <em>yippie;</em> we have <em>yomp</em> and <em>yump</em>, <em>yuck</em> and <em>yucky</em>, <em>yack</em>, <em>yowza</em>, and <em>yipes</em>.”</p>\n<p>Methinks we are now <em>Y</em>sed up.</p>\n<p><em>[Barry Baldwin wrote on Grose's <em>Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</em> in <em>VERBATIM</em> XXIX/1.]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
