He and your readers, if they appreciate the French language, will realize that slips of the tongue in the English language are laughably unfunny to the French who speak the only language in the world that lends itself so beautifully to what they call a <em>contrèpeterie</em>.</p>\n<p>For the French, in all walks of life, to “render one sound for another” is not a slip but an art, practised equally studiously in bistros as well as in the salons of nobles, academicians, and beautiful people. When translated into English the words and thoughts that are <em>spirituel</em> [in the sense of 'witty'] or <em>cochon</em> [in the sense of 'licentious'] become crude locker-room obscenities. Many translations into English of the nouns <em>le con</em> and <em>la queue,</em> for example, grate. They shock with sound, and not always with image. But these, and like words, when formed in the mouth and on the lips of the French are soft, inviting, amusing. The f-verb in French is the same as for kiss: <em>baiser</em>. Calling a man a <em>con</em> is not insulting until you change your mind and add that he has <em>ni la douceur, ni la profondeur</em> of that lovable object. For the most part, what is irreverent, scatological, or pornographic in French sounds benign, and is, of course, <em>plein d'esprit</em>.</p>\n<p>(It is not within the province of this letter to delve into the principal female and male sexual organs and ponder why they have reversed genders. For the French, it just fits.)</p>\n<p>I have never come across a <em>contrepèterie</em> that was not off-color or irreverent, or touched on sex. That is Gallic, I guess. Let us start with irreverence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Femme folle à la messe</em></p>\n<p>vs.</p>\n<p><em>Femme molle à la fesse</em></p>\n<p><em>—Rabelais</em></p>\n<p><em>La joyeuse population du Cap</em></p>\n<p>not</p>\n<p><em>La joyeuse copulation du Pape</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(A high-school French-English dictionary will handle most of these. For the vulgar meanings of a couple of the words in the last <em>contrepèteries,</em> something like <em>Le Petit Robert: Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise</em> will be needed. I cringe at having to put those innocuous words into feelthy English.)</p>\n<p>Grounds Maintenance and Home Economics (including sex in the kitchen):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Il ne faut pas glisser dans la piscine</em></p>\n<p>do not say</p>\n<p><em>Il ne faut pas pisser dans la glycine</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>is the genus Wisteria in the plant kingdom.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Le linge qui séche</em></p>\n<p><em>but not</em></p>\n<p><em>Le singe qui léche</em></p>\n<p><em>Madame: votre mouton bouille</em></p>\n<p>not</p>\n<p><em>Madame: votre bouton mouille</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sex in the drawing room:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>La duchesse braquait sa lorgnette sur le jeune homme</em></p>\n<p><em>qui descendait en ballon</em></p>\n<p><em>vs.</em></p>\n<p><em>La duchesse lorgnait la braquette du jeune homme</em></p>\n<p><em>qui débandait dans le salon</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To prove by exception, I bring this to an end with a <em>contrepèterie</em> employing a word that sounds shitty even in French:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>La philanthropie de l'ouvrier charpentier</em></p>\n<p>not</p>\n<p><em>La tripe en folie de l'ouvrier partant chier</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would like to thank all my French friends who have furthered my contrepeteric education. Although there are many volumes of collections of <em>contrepèterie,</em> I would be delighted to learn of fresh and new ones—even “clean” ones.</p>\n<p>Afterthoughts: Speaking of/in French, I am surprised that no reader has yet commented on the <em>Colonial American English</em> <em>alamode</em> (<em>v</em>.), [<em>XVIII,</em> 3]. It might have been a very over here in 1796, but for the French, then as now, it is adjectival. <em>À la mode</em> in the fashion [of]' is generally followed by a place name: <em>tripes à la mode de Caen</em>. The abbreviated <em>boeuf à la mode</em>—no geography necessary for this national <em>plat du jour</em>—is, of course, and as correctly described in Amelia Simmons's <em>American Cookery,</em> “a round of Beef” cooked “with spices and vegetables.”</p>\n<p><em>[Douglas Sutherland Dodge, Guilford, Connecticut]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
