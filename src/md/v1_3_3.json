I\nam tempted to add, “...as we know it,” one of the\nmore boring clichés of our time, but I shall restrain\nmyself.</p>\n<p>Here, in (mercifully) abbreviated form, is a selection\nfrom those stylistic solecisms that Miss Stafford\nsingled out for vituperative comment:</p>\n<p>“[Let us] declare a honeymoon.”  --Walter Cronkite.\nQy: How is a honeymoon declared?</p>\n<p><em>diaper</em> “has three syllables, not two.”  --Various commercials.</p>\n<p>“nucular” for <em>nuclear</em>.  --Pres. Eisenhower.</p>\n<p><em>hopefully</em>,... --Pres. Kennedy.</p>\n<p>“All aspirin is not alike.” --TV commercial.</p>\n<p>“nauseous” for <em>nauseated</em>.  --TV commercial.</p>\n<p><em>gasid</em> indigestion.  --Various commercials.</p>\n<p>“You get a lot of dirt with kids; you get a lot of <em>clean</em>\nwith Tide.”  --TV commercial.  Qy: When did <em>clean</em>\nbecome a noun?</p>\n<p>“Adhesive that will really <em>bond</em> the denture to the\ngums.”  --TV commercial.</p>\n<p><em>guesstimate</em>.  --prevalent.</p>\n<p>“...a system for learning in depth...” --<em>Britannica</em>\ncommercial.</p>\n<p><em>opt for</em>.  --prevalent cliché.</p>\n<p><em>life style</em>.  --prevalent cliché.</p>\n<p><em>irregardless</em>.  --prevalent tautology.</p>\n<p><em>funded</em>.  --use of noun as verb.</p>\n<p><em>feedback</em>.  --semantic shift.</p>\n<p><em>input</em>.  --semantic shift.</p>\n<p><em>career experiences</em>.  --bureaucratic gobbledygook.</p>\n<p>“Economy doesn't have to be dull.”  --TV commercial.</p>\n<p><em>self-destruct</em>.  --nonword.</p>\n<p>“enormity” for <em>hugeness, enormousness, great importance</em>.</p>\n<p><em>no-commenting</em>.  --use of phrase as a verb.</p>\n<p><em>stonewalling</em>.  --neologistic cliché.</p>\n<p><em>specificity</em>.  --cliché.</p>\n<p>“At this point in time,...” --wordy cliché for <em>now,\nat present</em>.</p>\n<p><em>phased out</em>.  --semantic shift and cliché.</p>\n<p>-<em>wise</em>.  --trite suffix for making nouns into adverbs.</p>\n<p>It would be very dull, indeed, to examine each one of\nthese citations, but a few generalizations seem to be\nin order.  First of all, the problems can be classified into\nrelatively few categories:</p>\n<p>(1)  redundancies and tautologies: <em>irregardless</em></p>\n<p>(2)  boredom of the cliché: <em>guesstimate, opt for, life\nstyle, specificity, stonewalling, -wise, At this point in\ntime,</em> etc.</p>\n<p>(3)  intentional/unintentional and/or illogical gobbledygook:\n<em>career experiences, Economy doesn't have\nto be dull,</em> etc.</p>\n<p>(4)  metaphor: <em>declare a honeymoon, in depth, feedback,\ninput, phased out, bond,</em> etc.</p>\n<p>(5)  linguistic change: <em>clean, funded, no-commenting,</em>\netc.</p>\n<p>(6)  semantic change: <em>nauseous, bond, enormity,</em> etc.</p>\n<p>(7)  neologisms, blends, etc.: <em>guesstimate, self-destruct,\nstonewalling, gasid</em> (<em>indigestion</em>), etc.</p>\n<p>As can be seen--and I haven't tried being exhaustive\nin this superficial analysis--some of the more\nheinous examples cited by Miss Stafford fall into more\nthan one category.  It is noteworthy that except for\nclassifications 1, 2, and 3, which are usually so ephemeral\nas to have little or no effect on language (however\nthey may affect thinking, patience, and nerves),\nall these categories are the stuff of which language is\nmade.  Change is one of the definitive characteristics\nof language, despite Miss Stafford's unwillingness to\nrecognize it.  Critics of contemporary language have\nalways been among us—Richard Grant White was a\nfamous Victorian example—but the language has survived\ndespite their quixotic failings.  In fact, if, fifty\nyears later, one examines the solecisms which they\noften became most excited and scornful about, it often\nturns out either that the same condemned usages are\nstill the object of Guardians' censure or that they have\nbecome standard, and it is hard to understand what\nthe fuss was all about.</p>\n<p>Miss Stafford, self-appointed (and, I suspect,\n<em>Times</em>-supported) Defender of the Faith in the English\nLanguage, fails to recognize these elementary\nfacts.  After all, if everyone had her gifts, chances are\nshe never would have received her Pulitzer Prize—if\none could be awarded at all.  If she needs evidence that\nlanguage changes, let her analyze and compare with\nModern English writings of which she approves the\nwritings of Spenser, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton,\nAusten, and other English “masters of style” whose\nwritings need varying degrees of interpretation, depending\non their remove from the contemporary\nreader.</p>\n<p>The problem, which seems to elude Miss Stafford,\nlies not with TV, which is, after all, merely the medium\nof expression and not the expression itself, but with\nthe poor <em>style</em>, not the poor language.  Yet Miss Stafford,\neither blinded by her contumelious zeal or hanging\non for dear life as her runaway hobby horse gallops\ninto the sunset (possibly both), deplores the povertystricken\nimagery that is often the result of a combination\nof an impoverished imagination and a hyperactive\ngift of gab instead of ignoring it, comforted by the\nknowledge that it will all soon dry up and blow away.</p>\n<p>In short, she is playing right into the hands of\nthose she criticizes, for all they want is to be attended\nto and remembered, and, through her articles, Miss\nStafford is elevating them to a higher memorial than\nthey could otherwise merit.  Come to think of it.  I\nshould never have written this article.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
