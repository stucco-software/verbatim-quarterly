Shapiro</span></h1>\n<p>A few remarks on the myriad delights of VERBATIM III, 1:</p>\n<p>I wish that Axel Hornos had distinguished between the two kinds of interjections: those that are mere sounds— the “ouch” and “phooey” variety—and those that are actual words used exclamatively. When an Italian shouts <em>bravo</em>, for example, he isn't just voicing indiscriminate onomatopoeia; he is using a bona fide adjective. (Hence the feminine, <em>brava</em>, to a deserving diva.) Likewise the German <em>toll</em> 'fantastic, smashing,' and the Indonesian <em>bagus</em> 'beautiful' and <em>adjaib</em> 'wonderful.' Similarly, several of Mr. Hornos's examples are verb forms. The Spanish <em>oye</em> is an imperative of <em>oír</em> 'hear'; the Dutch <em>zeg</em>—note the spelling, though pronounced “zeCH”—is an imperative of <em>zeggen</em> 'say,' as in the English 'Say there'; and even the Italian <em>evviva</em>, thinly disguised, is fundamentally a verb: the hortatory subjunctive of <em>vivere</em>, plus an exclamatory <em>e</em>, and meaning, roughly, 'Long (may you) live!' Numerous current American monstrosities could be cited as interesting hybrids of the two types of interjection, generally expansible: e.g., 'like wow!', 'like I mean wow!', 'like man I mean wow!'</p>\n<p>H.N. Meng's suggestion that the <em>spit</em> of <em>spit and image</em> is a deformation of <em>spirit</em> delights my etymo-logic, but unfortunately I think it misses the mark. While <em>OED</em> documents this use of <em>spit</em> no earlier than the 1800s, Partridge (<em>Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English</em>) gives analogous usages from two centuries before. That we are dealing here with honest-to-goodness <em>spit</em> and not <em>spirit</em> (or even <em>spi't</em>) would seem to be corroborated by a similar French phrase, attested as early as the 15th century. A child who is the image of his father is commonly said to be <em>son pére tout craché</em>, freely translated as 'the very spit of his father.' The <em>The Nouveau Dictionnaire Etymologique du Français</em> (Hachette-Tchou, 1971) offers as an explanation the analogy between the act of spitting and the act of procreation which, if accurate, is rather a far cry from the realm of the spirit.</p>\n<p>In passing, Candace Murray Huddleston's reference to the Kentuckian use of <em>poke</em> for <em>sack</em> or <em>bag</em> calls to mind the origin of the expression <em>to buy a pig in a poke</em>. The term is, of course, cognate with the French <em>poche</em> 'pocket.' Interestingly enough, the French buy cats in theirs, not pigs, as in the expression <em>acheter chat en poche</em>....</p>\n<p>And lastly, as for your comments on sentence-ending prepositions, I couldn't agree more. Especially with the observation that they are often really verbal particles...</p>\n<p>Still, logic and linguistic histroy notwithstanding, a certain aversion to ending a sentence (or clause) with a preposition has ingrained itself into the instinct of would-be discriminating speakers over the years since the 18th century grammarians imposed their spurious rule. (That is, in relative clauses, and where the preposition is a real one and not a verbal particle.) In defense of the purists it should be admitted that it is, in fact, a convenient rule to have when we want to tailor our speech to the audience and the occasion. Circumstances will tell me whether to say “the guys I work with” or “the gentlemen with whom I work.” It's one of those differentiations, however illegitimate their origin, that English is richer for holding onto. (Or “onto which English is richer for holding”?)</p>\n<p><em>[Norman R. Shapiro, Wesleyan University]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
