The dictionary dispelled that naive notion by giving\n<em>buttor-fléoge (OED)</em> as the earliest form, establishing\nthe oleaginous connection which Mr. Hornos rightly resents.\nThe <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> plainly states that the origin\nof the word is unknown. An explanation sometimes offered\nis that certain species are the colour of butter. It is true that\nconspicuous amongst the earliest to appear in the English\nspring is the handsome brimstone butterfly (<em>Gonopteryx</em>—\nthe 'angle-winged'). The male is indeed the colour of butter;\nbut why extend the name to the many other species, not one\nof which is truly yellow? Lepidopterists must have been rare\nin the Dark Ages, and perhaps, after the first pleasure of\nseeing the brimstone, the Anglo-Saxon ignored the later\nvarieties. Yet there was a persistent association of butterflies\nwith a golden colour. King Lear planned to “laugh at gilded\nbutterflies,” Drummond of Hawthornden wrote of\n“golden butterflies,” and the naturalist John Ray\n(1628-1705) when asked “What is the use of butterflies?”\nreplied “To adorn the world and delight the eyes of men, to\nbrighten the countryside, serving like so many golden\nspangles to decorate the fields.”</p>\n<p>Another suggestion is that the first butterflies reappeared\nat the same season as butter. In the days before\nbovine dietetics, cattle, cropping the sparse winter pasture,\nmay well have become thin and have ceased to yield milk\nuntil spring renewed the lush grass, bringing with it the\nearly butterflies.</p>\n<p>But enough of speculation: let it remain an Anglo-Saxon\nmystery. In the words of Chaucer: “Swich talkyng is\nnat worth a boterflye.”</p>\n<p><em>[W. R. Edwards, Chesham, Buckinghamshire]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
