I have columns, for example, of words derived from famous people's names, like <em>martinet, Ferris Wheel</em> and <em>Stronganoff</em>. I even have a women-only column, brief as it may be at this point, with such entries as <em>maudlin</em> and <em>bloomer</em>. Not all the categories focus on people.

I am fascinated with -<em>ine</em> (Middle English, 'pertaining to') ending words that relate to the animal kingdom. Some are obvious, like <em>bovine</em> 'cowlike,' <em>canine</em> 'dog-like,' <em>feline</em> 'catlike,' <em>elephantine</em> 'elephantlike' and <em>equine</em> 'horselike.' Others are not as familiar, <em>anserine</em> 'gooselike.' <em>ranine</em> 'froglike' and <em>ca\\pgrave\\rine</em> 'goatlike.'</p>\n<p>My search for animal-like adjectives began several years ago. A newspaper article described the announcer at a Playboy Bunny of the Year Contest as a “porcine” ('piglike') emcee. I thought what a perfectly polite way to depict a fat slob; there must be more like this. Since then I have zeroed in on other journalistic uses of the words. For instance, in May 1975, the Associated Press ran a story, accompanied with a sketch, on “bovine” brassieres. (And, incidentally, the bovine bras come in four sizes to support sagging udders.)</p>\n<p><em>Vulpine</em> 'foxlike' starlet and <em>aquiline</em> 'eaglelike' nose are <em>Timese</em> favorites. In <em>People</em> (13 Oct. '75), the caption over a picture-story of the bearded actor Peter Ustinov read, “Leonine Ustinov.” “Clown Emmett Kelly Jr. has a small but elephantine wedding,” was a kicker in the table of contents of <em>People</em> (2 Aug. '76). Nuptials for the 51-year-old Kelly and his waitress-girlfriend were conducted atop a circus pachyderm.</p>\n<p>Related to this particular list are words ending in -<em>ian</em>, meaning characteristic or resembling. Examples are <em>apian</em> 'beelike,' <em>simian</em> 'apelike' and <em>vermian</em> 'wormlike.' Then there are words like <em>swine</em> and <em>ermine</em>. Although they end in -<em>ine</em>, they are not included in the list, as they are not adjectives describing a certain creature.</p>\n<p>The following is a glossary of my collection of animal -<em>ine</em> adjectives that pertain to, resemble or are characteristic of an animal:</p>\n<p>{{&lt; column &gt;}} {{}} accipitrine 'hawklike' {{}}\n{{}} anguine 'snakelike' {{}}\n{{}} anserine 'gooselike' {{}}\n{{}}aquiline 'eaglelike' {{}}\n{{}}asinine 'asslike' {{}}\n{{}}bovine 'cowlike' {{}}\n{{}}canine 'doglike' {{}}\n{{}}caprine 'goatlike' {{}}\n{{}}cervine 'deerlike' {{}}\n{{}}colubrine 'kingsnakelike' or 'gartersnakelike'{{}}\n{{}}elephantine 'elephantlike' {{}}\n{{}}equine 'horselike' {{}}\n{{}}feline 'catlike' {{}}\n{{}}herpestine 'mongooselike'{{}}\n{{}}hircine 'goatlike, especially in strong odor or lustfulness {{}}\n{{}}lacertine or lacertilian 'lizardlike' {{}}\n{{}}lemurine 'lemurlike' {{}}\n{{}}leonine 'lionlike' {{}}\n{{}}lupine 'wolflike' {{}}\n{{}}lutrine 'otterlike' {{}}\n{{}}murine 'mouselike' {{}}\n{{}}oscine 'songbirdlike' {{}}\n{{}}ovine 'sheeplike' {{}}\n{{}}passerine 'perching-songbirdlike' {{}}\n{{}}pavonine 'peacocklike' {{}}\n{{}}piscine 'fishlike' {{}}\n{{}}porcine 'piglike' or 'swinelike' {{}}\n{{}}ranine 'froglike' {{}}\n{{}}serpentine 'serpentlike' {{}}\n{{}}suilline 'hoglike' {{}}\n{{}}suine 'swinelike' {{}}\n{{}}taurine 'bull-like' {{}}\n{{}}ursine 'bearlike' {{}}\n{{}}viperine 'viperlike' {{}}\n{{}}vulpine 'foxlike' {{}}\n{{}}</p>\n<h2></h2>",
