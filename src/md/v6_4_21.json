Benjamin Keller of Harbor City, Calif., contributes\n“preventative” (which Webster lists as acceptable),\n“frust-r-um,” “burg-u-lar,” “ab-o-lutions” (for washing) and\n“Texian” for <em>Texan</em>.

Her two-year-old child likes going to the “li-a-bary,”\nand as a youngster herself she used to say “ell-a-bow.”</p>\n<p>Carolyn Sobel of Queens College, N.Y.C., complains\nthat “caroom” and my other double O words are not epenthetical\nbut mispronunciations.  I claim they fit the Webster\ndefinition of epenthesis (which Ms. Sobel says is correct):\n“The insertion of an extra consonant or vowel in the pronunciation\nof a word.”  Some will agree with me and some\nwith my critic, but that's what it's all about.</p>\n<p>If I've overlooked any correspondents I apologize for\nnot being organized and efficient.</p>\n<p>P.S. No less an excellent writer and stylist than George V.\nHiggins either committed an epenthesis or had poor proof-reading\ndo it in his name.  In a beautifully written book\ncalled “A Year or So with Edgar,” about some improper\nBostonians, the word “depiliate” (for <em>depilate</em>) appears.  Mr.\nHiggins is not necessarily responsible for this, but the appearance\nof such a word in print may linger in another\nwriter's mind and show up later and elsewhere because of\nthis.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
