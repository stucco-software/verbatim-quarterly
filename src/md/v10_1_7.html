<p>Harry Fieldhouse (J.M. Dent, 1982), xiii + 270 pp.</p>
<p>The first item served up for criticism in this book is the
pronunciation system: without wasting much time on it, I
should point out that it is awful, though undoubtedly it would
have not been quite so bad had the book designer kept his
itchy fingers off it and set it in a serif face, not sansserif, as it
appears in the book.  If the reader does not know how a word is
pronounced before checking it in the Guide, he is likely to
learn little from the information provided.</p>
<p>I am confused, too, as to why Dent thought that this book
would (or could) do well in America.  Its orientation is British;
though American English is occasionally mentioned, the punctuation
of the text is British in style, and the language and style
described is mainly British.  For instance, <em>classified</em> is described
as “a contraction of classified as secret”; in American English
(at least), it means “classified as confidential, secret, top secret,
etc.”  The comment under <em>differ from/with</em> concerning <em>different/differently</em>
with <em>to/from</em> illustrates a typically British usage:
Americans may say “different than,” but they are rarely heard
to say “different to,” which is British.  The pronunciation of
<em>muezzin</em>, given as rhyming with “Dewey's in,” is not verifiable
in any American dictionary I checked or in <em>Collins English
Dictionary</em>.  Other pronunciations are also odd: that of <em>crochet,</em>
for instance; the comment that <em>depot</em> is pronounced in American
English as DEE'POE (how about the WWII <em>repple-depot</em>?);
<em>mezzanine</em> is never pronounced <em>metsa-</em> in the U.S.; only British
*r-*less pronunciations (HAWD for <em>hoard/horde</em>) are shown.  Other
problems: <em>Celluloid</em> is still a trademark (in the U.S.), where
<em>hoover</em> for 'use a vacuum cleaner' is not used; the objection to
<em>hopefully</em> is by no means confined to Britain; <em>alternate</em> is not
stressed on the second syllable (when used as a verb) in
America.</p>
<p>There are many other matters that could be taken up here.
Were it not for the publication of this book in America (where
it contains too many inaccuracies to be useful), it might be
passed off as unworthy of comment.  But the inaccuracies about
American English are a serious disservice to British readers, as
well, making the work of dubious value on either side of the
pond.</p>
