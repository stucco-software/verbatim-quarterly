Some are not much used: <em>aba, chimere, jallaba, simar, tarboosh, zimarra,</em> for instance. Some, though they are a part of everyday speech, have not been thoroughly domesticated: <em>anorak, batik, kimono, parka, poncho, sarong</em>—all still speak, as it were, with the trace of a foreign accent. Others are unlikely to be identified as aliens except by wordsmiths (and VERBATIM readers). Such are <em>cotton, dolman, gingham, robe, shawl, stole,</em> as well as <em>camisole, gown,</em> and <em>jumper</em>.</p>\n<p>The etymological information provided in <em>Webster's Third New International Unabridged</em> tells us that <em>camisole</em> entered English from French, was probably from Old Provençal <em>camisolla</em>, from <em>camisa</em> 'shirt' from LL <em>camisa, camisia</em> 'shirt, thin dress,' probably of Germanic origin, akin to OE <em>ham</em> 'undergarment,' <em>hama</em> 'cover, skin,' <em>hemetha</em> 'shirt,' and to Skt <em>śāmulya</em> 'woolen shirt.' We are not told if there is also a connection with Gk <em>heima</em> 'garment,' <em>chlamyd-, chlamys</em> 'cloak, mantle,' Per <em>jāma</em> 'garment.'</p>\n<p>Old Provencal was not the only borrower of LL <em>camisa</em>. Old French changed it to <em>chemise</em>, which was taken unaltered into Middle English. Spanish <em>camisa</em> also entered English unchanged but gave a second word, <em>camis</em> or <em>camus</em> 'light loose robe.' In Arabic LL <em>camisa</em> became <em>gamīs, kamís</em> 'long shirt' and was taken into English as <em>camise</em> 'light, loose, long-sleeved shirt, gown, or tunic sometimes worn as an undergarment,' and Modern Greek has <em>hypokámiso</em> 'shirt.' Turkish <em>câme</em> 'cloth wrap, garment,' <em>gömlek</em> 'shirt,' <em>kumas</em> 'cloth'; Arabic <em>kumash</em> 'cloth,' <em>hamlat</em> 'woolen cloth, plush,' which became MF <em>camelot</em>, ME <em>cameloit</em> 'camlet'—all seem to be collateral kin. Could Amharic <em>shamma</em> 'chamma, a cotton, toga-like, usually white garment' also be related?</p>\n<p>A glance at <em>gown</em> leads us back to ME <em>goun</em>, MF <em>gone, goune</em> 'gown' from LL <em>gunna</em> 'fur or leather garment.' Modern Greek <em>goūna means 'fur'; Ir Gael gúna</em>, 'dress'; W <em>gwn</em>, 'that which is stitched'; Hindi <em>ganī, gonī</em> (&gt;E. <em>gunny</em>) from Skt gonī 'sack' probably comes, says <em>Webster's</em>, from Dravidian, akin to Kanarese gōni 'sack'; Skt <em>guna</em> means 'thread, strand, quality': the similarities of sense and sound hint that these words, too, are related to LL <em>gunna</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Jump</em> 'loose jacket; an underbodice' is, <em>Webster's</em> tells us, probably an alteration of <em>jupe</em>, as is <em>jumper</em>. When we look at <em>jupe</em>, we find that it entered Middle English as <em>juype</em> from OF <em>jupe</em> 'man's coat or tunic' from Ar <em>jubbah</em> 'coat, garment,' which also gave MF <em>jupon</em>, ME <em>iopoun, iupone, iopon</em> 'jupon, a tight-fitting padded garment worn under armor; a late medieval jacket similar to the surcoat,' ME <em>gipoun</em> 'gipon, jupon,' as well as <em>jibba</em> and <em>jubbah</em>. Turkish <em>cübbe, cüppe</em> 'robe, gown,' OIt <em>giubba</em> 'jacket,' MHG <em>schube</em> 'outer garment,' and Russ <em>shuba</em> 'fur coat' are all kin. What about Dolpo Tibetan <em>chuba</em> 'sleeveless tunic'? Surely it, too, is a member of the family? And can it be that Ar <em>suf</em> 'wool' which gave Turkish <em>sof</em> 'fine wool, camlet' is also one of the clan?</p>\n<p>Languages, like large, burgeoning families, receive hand-me-downs from relatives and strangers indiscriminately. Sometimes they shorten a hem or a sleeve, sometimes, add a collar, cape, or flounce; and sometimes, after transforming flour sacks into furbelows, topcoats into tunics, they return the altered garment to the giver.</p>",
