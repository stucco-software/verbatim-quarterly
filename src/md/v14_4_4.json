Hirschberg</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Elmsford, New York</span></em></p>\n<p>In “Tooth and the Whole Tooth” Robert Benchley\noffered the challenge: “The English language may\nhold a more disagreeable combination of words than\n'The doctor will see you now'... I'm not narrow-minded\nabout it.  I'm willing to consider other possibilities.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b1\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup>\nI wish to propose three statements which, if not\nmore unpleasant, are close runners-up:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>“There's a lawyer on the phone for you.”</li>\n<li>“There's a policeman at the door for you.”</li>\n<li>“Is that a man coming through our window?”</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our fear and loathing of contact with both sides of the\nlaw may be enhanced by our difficulty in understanding\nthe English of its denizens, whose dialects are alien\nto us.</p>\n<p>The law is, like Euclid's geometry, a self-contained,\ninternally consistent set of postulates and rules.\nIt is purported to have relevance to the real world.\nThere its similarity to a mathematical system ends.\nThe observer who is unfamiliar with the mysteries of\ncourtroom proceedings may question his own ears.  As\nAlice said to the Caterpillar in Wonderland, “Some of\nthe words have got altered.”</p>\n<p>The law distinguishes <em>facts</em> (actualities) from <em>truth</em>\n(a legal principle governing or declaring facts).  <em>False\nfacts</em>—also known as <em>simulated</em> or <em>fabricated\nfacts</em>—(those existing only in their assertion, and without\nfoundation in reality) are contrasted to <em>legal\nfictions</em> (things known false but presumed true).  <em>Fabricated\nfacts</em> have another meaning—actual facts which\na lawyer has artfully given a false appearance.  The\nmathematician's proof (beyond any doubt) does not\nallow for the sort of flexibility of thought inherent in\nthe lawyer's concepts of <em>clear and convincing evidence,\npreponderance of the evidence,</em> and <em>proof beyond\nreasonable doubt.</em></p>\n<p>Flexibility lets judges interpret the laws, and is at\nthe heart of the appeals process.  Further linguistic\npeculiarities arise because definitions are not engraved\nin stone.  Thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Artificial persons</em> are not androids; they are\ncreations of the law for societal purposes.</p>\n<p>Corporations and partnerships are examples.\nThey are distinguished legally from <em>natural persons</em>—what\nnonlawyers would call “human beings.”\nSince a corporation is a person it must\nhave a <em>domicile</em>—the primary locus of its business\naffairs.  Collectively, persons are “such, not\nbecause [they are] human, but because rights\nand duties are ascribed to [them].”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Though lawsuits are allegedly adversarial,\nthere exist <em>amicable actions,</em> brought by mutual\narrangement of the parties, with facts already\nsettled by agreement, so that courts might make\nfindings on doubtful questions of law.</p>\n<p><em>Violent presumption</em> is not, for instance, asking\nfor a date while brandishing a submachine\ngun; it is, rather, indirect proof of a fact by\nproof of necessarily attendant circumstances.\nHere it is illustrated, in a demonstration of\nwhen to stop asking questions on cross-examination:</p>\n<p>Q.  Did you actually <em>see</em> my client bite off the\nvictim's nose?</p>\n<p>A.  No.  [The questions should stop here.]</p>\n<p>Q.  Then how can you say he bit it off?</p>\n<p>A.  I saw him spit it out.</p>\n<p>Not a gynecological conclusion, but a legal\none, is the <em>negative pregnant.</em>  This is a denial\nformulated in such a way as to admit the substantial\nfact which appears controverted.  For instance:</p>\n<p>Q.  Lizzie, did you not take an axe and whack\nyour mother forty times and then whack\nyour father forty-one times when faced\nwith the prospect of cold mutton stew?</p>\n<p>A.  Not true.  We were to eat Brussels sprouts\nfondue that day.</p>\n<p>To deny comprehensively in court, one must\ndeny every aspect of the allegation individually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since imprecise turns of phrase might allow the\nopposition to inflict a fatal blow on his case, the lawyer\nsets up a linguistic strategic defense.  The favorite\nweapon is iteration, to the point that one sometimes\nwonders whether the father of the thesaurus was really\na lawyer.  (Alas, Peter Roget was a physician.)  Legal\nproceedings are thus peppered with phrases like <em>lands,\ntenements, and hereditaments</em>, 'real property,' <em>goods\nand chattels</em> 'personal property,' <em>goods, wares and merchandise</em>\n'chattels subject to trade or sale,' <em>lewd and\nlascivious cohabitation</em> (as if <em>lewd</em> were not enough!),\n<em>fair and impartial jury</em> (could it fair and partial?),\n<em>sick, sore, lame and disabled</em> (how to make a point in a\npersonal injury action).  A standard form of will includes\nin one of its sections:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate\nof whatever kind and nature, real, personal,\nand mixed and wherever situated ... I give, devise,\nand bequeath to my trustees ... for the\nfollowing uses and purposes:<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with arcane use of common English words,\nthe legal profession's vocabulary contains healthy doses\nof French and Latin, as well as hoary terms.  Some of\nthese are useful shorthand for legal complexities, and\nhave entered the language of nonlawyers (e.g., <em>res ipsa\nloquitur, caveat emptor, habeas corpus).</em>  Others are\nexclusively of the law, e.g., <em>voir dire</em>—French, 'to\nspeak the truth'—the preliminary screening examination\nof jurors or witnesses by the court; <em>barratry</em>—the\noffense of stirring up frequent groundless lawsuits,\nprofiting only the attorney; <em>champerty</em>—third-party\nfunding of a lawsuit in exchange for a share in the\nproceeds if it is successful; <em>estoppel</em>—precluding of\none's allegation because of his previous acts or allegations\nto the contrary.</p>\n<p>Sometimes lawyers do manage to loosen up, especially\nwhen bantering off the record.  Then their terms\nof art may overlap the vocabulary of their less-reputable\nclientele.  A straightforward, polite legal contest\nwith clear evidence and solid witnesses on both sides is\na <em>swearing contest</em> (the winner “swears” its evidence\nmore convincingly).  It is contrasted with proceedings\nin which each side gives the other as difficult a time as\npossible by means of dilatory, nitpicking, senseless\ntechnicalities—the <em>pissing contest</em> (after the decathlons\nof micturition for which small boys are notorious).\nTheir criminal clients might offer the <em>SODDI\ndefense</em> (<em>S</em>ome <em>O</em>ther <em>D</em>ude <em>D</em>id <em>I</em>t), with the more\nfortunate defendants convicted only of a <em>paper felony</em>\n(a finding on paper, but involving no added prison\ntime) or sentenced to a <em>bullet</em>—a one-year term.\nJudges and attorneys speak of a <em>dropsy case,</em> in which\nan unscrupulous police officer, wishing to circumvent\nthe legal requirement of a probable cause for having\nsearched the accused (with the fruit of an unreasonable\nsearch inadmissible in court), testifies that “as I\napproached I saw him take the [gun / knife / packet of\nwhite powder / etc.]  from his pocket and drop it on the\nground at his feet.”</p>\n<p>Police dialect's formal voice, used in court testimony\nand official reports, may have arisen (or descended)\nfrom emulation of the erudite verbiage of\nattorneys.  It may be an attempt thus to gain credibility\nwith a jury.  Its use certainly causes a loss of color in\nthe portrayal of events.  An annotated version of an\nexcerpt from a typical police report may illustrate the\npoint:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>On a radio run</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b4\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">4</a></sup> to the above location <em>I and my\npartner</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b5\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">5</a></sup> <em>observed</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b6\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b6\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">6</a></sup> that <em>entry had been made\nthrough the rear door</em>.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b7\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b7\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">7</a></sup> <em>At this time</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b8\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b8\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">8</a></sup>  we <em>exited</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b9\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b9\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">9</a></sup>\nour <em>vehicle</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b10\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b10\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">10</a></sup> and observed the subject.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b11\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b11\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">11</a></sup>  <em>Subsequent\nto this</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b12\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b12\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">12</a></sup> the subject turned and drew a\n<em>firearm</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b13\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b13\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">13</a></sup> from his pocket.  I drew my <em>weapon</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b14\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b14\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">14</a></sup>\n...and <em>apprehended the alleged perpetrator</em>.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b15\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b15\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">15</a></sup>\nAt this time, <em>I advised the subject of his rights\nfrom a card which I carry with me</em>.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b16\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b16\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">16</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The colloquial cop-to-cop talk is metaphorical,\ncolorful, and telegraphic—a more accurate reflection\nof the electricity and urgency of police work.  Perpetrators\nare reduced to <em>perps,</em> their offenses to initials (OC\n'organized crime,' D&amp;D 'drunk and disorderly,' CCW\n'carrying a concealed weapon,” B&amp;E 'breaking and\nentering').  Fans of broadcast police shows, from\n“Racket Squad” to “Dragnet” to “Hill Street Blues,”\nknow of A.P.B.  (<em>all points bulletin</em>—a general alert)\nand M.O. (<em>modus operandi</em>—the perp's method).  The\npoliceman's club is a <em>billy;</em> his second, nonregulation\ngun a <em>saver.</em>  The officer's badge or ID card is a <em>potsy</em>\n(tin, used to make pots, was used to make badges),\nwith favors received for showing a badge <em>on the tin.</em></p>\n<p>When a <em>body</em> (a person chargeable with a crime)\nis apprehended he is <em>busted</em> or <em>collared.</em>  Upon apprehension\nin the United States, a suspect is <em>read his rights</em>\nor <em>Mirandized</em> (from the decision in <em>Ernesto A. Miranda\nv. the State of Arizona</em>).  Because these rights (to\nremain silent, to have a lawyer's advice before interrogation\nand his presence during questioning, to a lawyer\nfree of charge if one cannot be afforded, to stop\nanswering questions at any time) must be clearly and\ncompletely stated, the arresting officer may rely on\nreading from his <em>Miranda card.</em>  While there are constitutional\nguarantees against warrantless searches, a\n<em>no-knock</em> raid (without the warning, “Open up. Police.\nWe have a warrant.”)  may be used to secure evidence\nbefore it can be destroyed.  <em>No-sock</em> laws say that\nforce cannot be used in resisting an <em>illegal</em> arrest.  The\nsuspect is then <em>mugged</em> (photographed—from the picture\nof a face, or “mug”), and his <em>rap sheet,</em> or <em>yellow\nsheet</em> ('arrest record') obtained.</p>\n<p>There is an extensive jargon among police for\ncorrupt or less-than-scrupulous behaviour of their colleagues.\nTo improve his <em>batting average</em> ('arrest statistics'—a\nbasis for promotion), an officer might resort to\n<em>accommodation collars</em> ('arrests made only to improve\nthat record').  Unjustified arrests may be fortified by\n<em>plants</em> ('evidence hidden by the police on the person or\nin the home or car of the suspect').  In contrast to the\n<em>saint</em>—the incorruptible cop who will not accept a <em>nut</em>\n('bribe')—are the <em>grass-eaters</em> (who accept, but do not\nsolicit, whatever bribes their beats offer) and the <em>meateaters</em>\n(who solicit and compel bribes).  Collectively,\ncrooked cops are <em>bent.</em></p>\n<p>With a population exceeding that of attorneys and\npolice, and absent the stabilizing influence of a <em>written</em>\nlanguage, criminal society's dialect is more varied\nand liabile than that of the law.  As fresh terminology is\npopularized, users of obsolete vocabulary risk sounding\nlike Damon Runyon characters or, worse, undercover\npolice.  Guns are no longer “heaters” or “Roscoes;”\nthey are <em>pieces.</em>  The murder victim is no longer\n“rubbed out,” “taken for a ride,” “hit,” or “offed;” he is\n<em>iced.</em></p>\n<p>A criminal specialist merits a specialized designation:\n<em>paper-hanger</em> 'passer of bad checks'; <em>crib man</em>\n'house burglar' (a “crib” is a house or apartment);\n<em>plastic artist</em> 'one who engages in credit card fraud';\n<em>blanket man</em> 'arsonist's accomplice' (who holds the\nblanket for extinguishing the arsonist who is overly\ninvolved in his work); <em>heavy</em> 'safecracker'; and <em>rip-off\nartist</em> a 'prostitute whose specialty is theft rather than\ncommercial sex' (and more generally, a 'thief who does\nnot deliver goods paid for').</p>\n<p>After he <em>does a job</em> ('commits a crime') the miscreant\nmay <em>split</em> or <em>book</em> ('flee').  If caught by the <em>heat</em>\n('police') he may try to <em>cop out</em> (or <em>cop a plea</em> 'plead to\na lesser charge') or <em>turn</em> (or <em>flip</em> 'become an informer')\nlest he <em>pull time</em> ('be sentenced to imprisonment').\nHowever, informing is a dangerous game.  Many prefer\nto <em>take the weight</em> ('take punishment alone though not\nthe sole guilty party') and not appear to have cooperated\nwith the police.  Higher-ups may <em>put a notice on</em>\n(or <em>take out a contract on</em> 'make a paid assignment to\nmurder') one who is thought to have squealed, and his\nwardrobe may soon include a <em>cement kimono.</em></p>\n<p>Cement kimonos, no-socks, artificial persons...\nYes, I'd very much prefer to see the doctor now.</p>\n<hr>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b1\">\n<p>In Benchley: <em>Love Conquers All</em> <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b2\">\n<p>Pollock: <em>First Book of Jurisprudence</em> <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b2\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 2\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b3\">\n<p>Klipstein: <em>Drafting New York Wills</em> 2nd ed. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b3\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 3\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b4\">\n<p>Sent by radio. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b4\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 4\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b5\">\n<p>we. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b5\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 5\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b6\">\n<p>saw. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b6\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 6\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b7\">\n<p>the back door was open. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b7\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 7\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b8\">\n<p>Then. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b8\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 8\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b9\">\n<p>got out of. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b9\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 9\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b10\">\n<p>car. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b10\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 10\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b11\">\n<p>suspect. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b11\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 11\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b12\">\n<p>Next. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b12\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 12\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b13\">\n<p>Suspects' guns are “firearms” ... <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b13\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 13\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b14\">\n<p>...and police guns are “weapons.” <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b14\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 14\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b15\">\n<p>arrested the suspect. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b15\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 15\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b16\">\n<p>I read him his Miranda rights [<em>vide infra</em>]. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-b16\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 16\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",
