Chamberlain</span></h1>\n<p>Five laws which excerpt the characteristics of the Intergalactic\nConspiracy to Deprive You of Your Right to Happiness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Jenkinson's Law</em> — It won't work.</p>\n<p><em>Pudder's Law</em> — Anything that begins well ends badly.</p>\n<p><em>Borkowski's Law</em> — You can't guard against the arbitrary.</p>\n<p><em>Sattinger's Law</em> — It works better if you plug it in.</p>\n<p><em>Murphy's Law</em> (of which Mr. Felton quotes only a portion):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1.)  Nothing is as easy as it looks.</p>\n<p>(2.)  Everything takes longer than you think.</p>\n<p>(3.)  If anything can go wrong, it will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two contributions to help explain the workings of\nbureaucracies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Oeser's Law</em> — There is a tendency for the person in the\nmost powerful position in an organization to spend all his\ntime serving on committees and signing letters.</p>\n<p><em>Dow's Law</em> — In any hierarchical organization, the higher\nthe level, the greater the confusion.</p>\n<p>Two comments about The Present State of Affairs:</p>\n<p><em>Price's First Law</em> — If everybody doesn't want it, nobody\ngets it.</p>\n<p><em>Kitman's Law</em> — Pure drivel tends to drive off the TV\nscreen ordinary drivel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The next three Laws are the only rational observations\nof which I am aware about the so-called quantitative “social\nsciences”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Hart's Law of Observation</em> — In a country as big as the\nUnited States, you can find fifty examples of anything.</p>\n<p><em>The Law of the Perversity of Nature</em> — You cannot successfully\ndetermine beforehand which side of the bread to\nbutter.</p>\n<p><em>Dibble's First Law of Sociology</em> — Some do, some don't.</p>\n<p>(Under this category is Felton's “Third Law of Experimental\nPsychology,” which I have known as “Harvard Law”\nand attributed to A.S. Sussman.)</p>\n<p>Under the well-known category of “Miscellaneous,” I\noffer the <em>Law of Probable Dispersal</em> — Whatever hits the fan\nwill not be evenly distributed.  (Also known as — <em>The How-Come-It-All-Landed-On-Me\nLaw</em>), and my own contributions,\nboth of which are probably plagiarized:</p>\n<p><em>Chamberlain's Laws</em>—(1.) The big guys always win,\nand (2.) Everything tastes more or less like chicken.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>Laurence Peter's Les Miserables Metalaw</em>: All\nlaws, whether good, bad, or indifferent, must be obeyed to\nthe letter.  (A Metalaw is a law about laws.) [<em>Jeffery F. Chamberlain, Rochester, New York</em>].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>P.S. I have seen Ormly Gumfudgin's “People never go there\nanymore; it's too crowded” attributed to Yogi Berra.  This\nreminds me of the venerable oxymoron, “good hitting always\nstops good pitching, and vice versa” which is supposed to\nhave been said first by the well-known dentist, Casey Stengel.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
