I had expected more, but proper nouns, abbreviations, and technical terms interfered. Perhaps revealing my ignorance, I could do nothing with “entropy to eolith” [437], “khoums to Kikuyu” [720], “polychrome to polyp” [1010], or even (for shame!) “bustier to butterfly shell” [179].</p>\n<p>A few combinations led to highly un-p.c. thoughts: “British to Brobdingnagian” [166], “dago to damage control” [333], “Irishman to irrational” [691]. Sometimes relationships seem to work better if alphabetical order is reversed, as in “chocolate to choose” [231] or “jack-of-all-trades to jailbait” [699]. In cases where a word has multiple definitions, I took whichever pleased me, as in “boss to bottom feeder” [154], where this page's <em>boss</em> refers to “an ornamental protuberance.” Certain items appear suited for the first part of an analogy test: “participation to party line” [951] or “rollover to romantic”[1126]. Whatever: <em>chacun à son goût.</em></p>\n<p>Here is a sampling of those I liked, with some comments. Pick your favorite dictionary some dull evening and make your own list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“abacus to Abélard” [2]: he forgot to count.</p>\n<p>“all-time to alpha and omega” [37].</p>\n<p>“athlete's foot to atone” [84].</p>\n<p>“bogy to Bolshevik” [148].</p>\n<p>“C-clamp to celibacy” [210]: whoa!</p>\n<p>“cop to copulate” [292].</p>\n<p>“Debussy to decent” [341]: Nijinsky in <em>Afternoon of a Faun</em>?</p>\n<p>“Democratic Party to denature” [351]: help!</p>\n<p>“economy to Eden” [414].</p>\n<p>“erection to err” [443]: about that C-clamp...</p>\n<p>“fadeaway to fair catch” [467]: for the sports fan.</p>\n<p>“flesh to flimsy” [496]: if the spirit's willing...</p>\n<p>“Gawain to geländersprung” [538]: something for the medieval skier.</p>\n<p>“gosh to government” [561]: yes.</p>\n<p>“human nature to Humpty Dumpty” [635].</p>\n<p>“interception to interfere” [680]: which was it, Mr. Referee?</p>\n<p>“lie to life insurance” [758]: never!</p>\n<p>“Moses to motherland” [855]: in a patriarchal society?</p>\n<p>“night letter to Nineveh” [885]: might that have saved it?</p>\n<p>“ostracism to ouch” [925].</p>\n<p>“placebo to plaintiff” [995].</p>\n<p>“tattoo to taxonomy” [1319]: sounds like Lydia.</p>\n<p>“taxpayer to tear” [1320].</p>\n<p>“tosspot to touch-me-not” [1359]: “Lips that touch liquor...”</p>\n<p>“triple play to triumphant” [1377].</p>\n<p>“tutorial to twenty-twenty” [1389].</p>\n<p>“unicycle to unisex” [1404].</p>\n<p>“violoncello to virtuous” [1434].</p>\n<p>“whistle to white knight” [1465]: <em>Casablanca</em>, perhaps?</p>\n<p>“World Bank to worry beads” [1482]: indeed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a while, impossible entries rattled around in my subconscious. Where were “head to toe,” “Aix to Ghent,” “letter to Garcia,” or even “Heavens to Betsy?” And, as I listened to it in my mind, where was “Cheek to Cheek?”</p>\n<p>Now I leave the reader, perhaps in need of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, with the final entry: “zoophilous to ZZZ” [1500].</p>\n<p><em>[Although by trade a maths professor—now retired—Ed Rosenberg has for decades enjoyed writing, editing, and nit-picking.]</em></p>",
