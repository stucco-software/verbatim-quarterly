I find it odd that children need to be\ntaught about idioms, but that is another matter.</p>\n<p>If anyone from the staff of the <em>AHD</em> had a look at\nthis material I should be disappointed, for there are\nsome ambiguities.  For instance, (28) <em>throwing her\nhat into the ring</em> has: “In America in the early\n1800s, a man challenged another man by throwing\nhis hat into a ring.”  What ring?  What king of ring?  If\na boxing ring, why not say so?  (47) <em>batting a thousand:</em>\n“Baseball players have batting averages based\non the number of times they hit the ball when\nthey're up at bat.”  It seems to me that if you are\ngoing to explain something, explain it all: doesn't <em>hit</em>\nrequire the modifier “safely”?  And how is <em>thousand</em>\nexplained?  If an average is the total number of times\na batter hits a ball safely divided by the number of\ntimes he is at bat, even if he gets a hit each time, that\naverage is 1, not 1000, and some kids might need an\nexplanation.  (51) <em>punch the clock:</em> “Some business\nhave time clocks by their front door.”  Do they?</p>\n<p>I am being pedantic and hypercritical, but it\ndoes seem that a book of only 63 pages could have\nbeen done a little more carefully.  the book is pleasant\nenough, would certainly not do any harm, and\nmight very well encourage youngsters to think about\nlanguage.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
