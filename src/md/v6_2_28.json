Also, it reveals that\nthe writing system of Chinese is quite remote from the language\nitself (in the sense that it relies on several different\nclasses of pictographic, ideographic, and metaphoric symbols,\nunlike alphabetic systems or syllabaries), so that learning\nthe rudiments of writing Chinese requires, even for the\nnative speaker, at least a year of daily practice and exercise.\nMuch of the symbolism in the language is culturally allusive,\nso that certain combinations of words or symbols may convey\na meaning that no non-native student of the language could\nguess at without a thorough knowledge of the culture.</p>\n<p>This situation can be illustrated by the following proverb:\n<em>frontier old man lose horse</em>, which can be translated as\n'The old man living at the frontier lost his horse.'  But its import\nis unclear without the following tale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When an old man lost his horse, his friends came to\ngrieve with him.  “Don't pity me,” he told them, “for\nthis may not be bad fortune.”  A few days later, the\nhorse returned to its stable, followed by several wild\nhorses.  This time, neighbors came to congratulate\nhim, but he told them, “Don't be overjoyed; this\ngood fortune may bring calamity.”  Soon afterwards,\nhis only son fell off one of the wild horses, broke his\nleg, and became a cripple.  The old man accepted the\ndisaster calmly, knowing it could be a blessing in\ndisguise.  After several years, a war broke out.  All\nable young men were drafted and sent to their deaths\non the battlefield.  The old man's son, because of his\nlame leg, remained at home to care for his father\nuntil death took the old man.  [p.97]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well-written and interesting, <em>Speaking of Chinese</em> is a\ngood introduction to the language and thought of 800 million\nChinese and helps make them a bit more scrutable.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
