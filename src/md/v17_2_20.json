Page 118 contain a quotation\nfrom <em>The Comedians</em>, by Graham Greene, “His\nslang ... was always a little out of date as though he\nhad studied a dictionary of popular usage, but not in\nthe latest edition,” the following dialogue, “A.\nDon't be a knothead.  Words are defined in word\ndictionaries.  Slang words are defined in slang dictionaries.\nB.

To quote: 'Look at Petey—a\nknothead...' ” For those who have not remained\nawake during class, I must repeat the fact that when\na dictionary, whether it be the <em>OED, Dictionary of\nAmerican Slang</em> (the source of this citation), or any\nother work uses quotations it simply lists the quotation\nas the earliest printed evidence found of the use\nof a word: that does NOT mean that the author of the\ncited work made up the word.  Just think how many\nwords must have been coined by writers whose\nworks are the only ones extant from early periods of\nthe language: people who misuse citation dictionaries\nmust think that Richard Rolle of Hampole, Holinshed,\nChaucer, Shakespeare, and a handful of other\ngeniuses sat down one day and invented the English\nlanguage, making up the words as they went along.\nThis book has a lot of cartoons and very few words.\nIts cover promises the reader will be able to answer\nquestions like “Why did Whoopi Goldberg once\nwork at a mortuary, and what did she do there?” and\n“How many paintings did Van Gogh actually sell\nduring his lifetime?”  If you regard life as a trivial\npursuit, then knowing the answers to those might be\nimportant to you.
