The names of these correspondents are indexed, enabling potential book-buyers to confirm their immortality before sacrificing their ill-gotten gains. Jacques Barzun should, accordingly, buy six copies.</p>\n<p>Those who think that Safire writes only about politics from the Washington Bureau of <em>The New York Times</em> should be aware that he also writes a widely syndicated weekly column on language for the Sunday Magazine of the <em>N.Y. Times.</em> Lately, this column has been focused, a bit too frequently for my tastes, on the jargon that echoes within the Beltway—that is, insiders' Washington, DC, for the uninitiated. Another complaint is his detailed treatment of the semantics of a word, appropriate, perhaps, to synonym studies in dictionaries (but only too rarely well done there) but telling most readers more than they ever wanted to know about a given handful of terms. One more adverse comment, this time for whoever wrote the jacket copy: when Bill (or anyone else) mentions that <em>long in the tooth</em> was “first used in print in an 1852 novel by William Makepeace Thackeray” (p.287), it does not mean that Thackeray “originated” the phrase.</p>\n<p>Accumulations of Bill Safire's books (of which I think this is the tenth anthology of his language articles) afford us with articulate commentary on American usage in the last quarter of the 20th century. Other books, written with his brother, deal with other aspects of language; in addition to two novels, he has written five books on politics among which— curiously—is not included his <em>Dictionary of Politics</em>, entitled <em>Safire's New Political Dictionary</em> in its later incarnations. I cannot repress a personal comment or two, for I have known Bill since the early 1960s, I when his <em>Dictionary of Politics</em> was edited under my direction at Random House. In the early 1970s, I wrote to <em>The N.Y. Times</em> managing editor, Arthur Rosenthal, suggesting that he consider a regular column on language (to be written, of course, by me). The idea was accepted, but not the author, for Safire was regarded by the <em>Times</em> as its “resident lexicographer,” the man properly qualified to do the job.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
