Henry</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Clarksboro, New Jersey</span></em></p>\n<p>Has your name haunted you and convulsed others\nsince you were a child?  Was it nearly impossible\nfor you to have a peaceful elementary\nschool experience?  Could you barely wait until you\nwere old enough to use your first and your middle\nname?  Have you never told your middle name to\nanyone (except the teachers at school)?  Were you\nstuck with a family name that the dog wouldn't even\nanswer to?</p>\n<p>On the other hand, has your name always been\nplain, generic, and no-frills?  Do you fail to lift a bureaucratic\neyebrow at the Motor Vehicle agency?\nHave you contemplated marriage only because you\nget to change your name?</p>\n<p>There are those who suffer with names and\nthose who don't, and, personally, I have always\nthought the sufferers have the better time of it.  They\nare usually the center of attention at parties and at\nconferences their name tags positively glow with\nrecognition.  Who remembers <em>Jane Smith</em> when <em>Jayne\nSmyth</em> can warm collective cockles on any day of the\nyear.  Since I have been a nonsufferer with a truly\ndull name (not even marriage made a difference),\nI've become a collector of offbeat names, a genuine,\ngreen-eyed, envious Name Maniac.  Names became\nsignificant to me at an early age.  It was the year I\ndiscovered that <em>Pansy Euphonia Ubrecht</em> resided in\nthe cabin next to mine at summer camp.  I listened in\nfascination as each camp counselor and administrator\nvied to involve her in extra roll calls.  Pansy\ncouldn't understand why her name was music to my\nears when she simply despised it.  I was oblivious to\nher moans of disgust.  All I wanted was to follow her\neverywhere to listen to others say her name.  Coming\nfrom a staunchly conservative, two-syllable past,\nI longed desperately for such melody in my life.  Her\nname ran through my thoughts at random moments\nfor four months.  My destiny was quietly locked into\nplace: look forever for other names of the <em>Pansy Euphonia\nilk</em>.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I've kept a name list for years—\ngreat reading for anyone with two or three hours of\nspare time.  After all, names are not just read: they\nmust be savored, rolled about on the tongue.  Since\nthe original list is so long, I've extracted a select\nnumber of names in the health professions only, as\nlisted in the publications that have passed over my\ndesk—a tribute to my employer, a famous medical\npublishing firm.  These are names that catch the eye\nand the ear, and make beautiful music of their own.\nSome are unusual, incongruous, gross, strange-look-ing,\ndownright odd, and some depend solely upon\njuxtaposition.  Most can be categorized; others must\nstand alone.  As for pronunciation, just say it the way\nyou see it.
