(er, I mean HELLO!) My name is Frederick and I\nwant to introduce you to my Very Formal Family.  We are not\nallowed to use nicknames at our house, which seems a little\nawkward at times.  My mother's name is Margaret, and no one\nhas EVER called her Peg or Marge—it just is not done.  My\nfather's name is James—never Jim or Jimmy.  Oh, and I almost\nforgot; there's also my little sister, Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>As I walked home from school one evening, I was thinking\nabout supper, hoping we might have hamburgers.  I even\nthought I would surprise Mother (never “Mom”) by offering to\nshape the patricias.  But, as I walked in the back door, I could\nsmell the simmering vegetables, and knew it was beef stuart.\nOne of my duties around home is setting the table.  Mother\nasked me to put the place matthews around the table, so we\ncould eat at our usual time, six o'clock on the dorothy.  She said\nif we all ate a good supper, she would treat us to some\nhomemade candace.  Did I eat!</p>\n<p>Our family isn't all that richard, but Father announced\nafter supper that his williamfold was in pretty good shape; and\nthat we could go somewhere special.  Of course Elizabeth\nwanted to go to the beach, but Father said he wasn't too crazy\nabout the sandra mess there would be in the car afterwards.\nAlso, Mother remembered the beatrice sting Elizabeth got\nthere once.</p>\n<p>Then I asked if we could go climbing at Cooper's Clifford,\njust a few miles outside town.  Mother reminded us of the\ncharles horse she had after last time.  Father said his archibalds\nwould never be the same after our last adventure there.</p>\n<p>Since no one could agree, we decided to spend a quiet\nevening at home.  Mother put on her old terrence robe,\nElizabeth got her theodore bear, and we all played games.  We\nall ate our philip of homemade candace and went to bed.</p>",
