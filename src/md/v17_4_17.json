To hold that psychology—even\nphysiology—has no relationship to\ngrammar seems overbearing to me, for experience\nhas a great deal to do with how we use and understand\nlanguage, which I consider highly associative.</p>\n<p>However, I should not enter the argument here:\nall theories have their strong and weak points, and\ntransformational grammar appears to have fewer\nweak ones.  I am interested in meaning, which is\ntreated as badly by Chomsky and his followers as it\nwas by the structuralists who preceded them.  As\nCarl Mills writes, linguistic competence includes\nknowledge of phonology and syntax but not semantics,\na view of Leonard Bioomfield's that created\nmany difficulties:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the other extreme, some linguists in the late\n1960s and early 1970s argued that almost all aspects\nof meaning in language ought to be explained\nby semantic rules in the grammar.  Not\nonly the meanings of words and the meanings of\nsentences, as most linguists define sentence\nmeanings, but also the appropriateness of the\nuses of sentences, the functions carried out by\nsentences, and numerous other facets of what we\ncall “meaning” have been proposed as part of the\nnative speaker's linguistic knowledge....  [W]e\n... note that adopting this view ... ultimately\nmay be equivalent to Bloomfield's view that no\naspects of meaning belong in grammar.  [p. 363]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it patently silly to waste time trying to\ndecide whether the Lexicon (note the capital L) of\nEnglish is conceived of as a list of words or as a list of\nmorphemes (meaningful elements that may stand\nalone or combine to form words) with a set of rules\ngoverning how the elements operate.  The question\nis trivial, for the systems need not be mutually exclusive,\nnor need they exclude phrasal sets like <em>Shut up!</em>\nand <em>kick the bucket</em> and <em>red herring</em> which do not\nyield to immediate constituent analysis.  It may be\nhard to believe, but in the 1960s some linguists advocated\na stochastic approach to grammatical analysis—that\nis, one in which each word was analyzed\non its own, without reference to what preceded or\nfollowed—an approach that even the merest intelligence\nought to have rejected.</p>\n<p>Grammar is a formidable term to many, largely\nbecause of their associations with it from their\nschooling, either in learning a foreign language or in\nlearning more about their own.  It is far from an easy\nsubject, but it can be an interesting one, particularly\nto those who enjoy seeing how such an extremely\ncomplicated phenomenon as language is (and can\nbe) put together to work.  Carl Mills has written a\nuseful, understandable, understanding, and informative\nintroduction to the subject.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
