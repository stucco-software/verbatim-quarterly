Try the Latin aloud, the way it\nwas meant to be read, and the hollow thump of a\nhorse's gallop is in the sound as well as the meaning of\nVirgil's words.</p>\n<p>Onomatopoeia has a long, honorable, and pleasurable\nhistory—from Aristophanes' <em>brek-ke-kex ko-ax\nko-ax</em> to Kermit's <em>ribbet, ribbet</em>—from majestic lines in\nancient epic poetry to simple, homey words like <em>plop,\nsplash</em>, and <em>murmur</em>.  In every language and time, the\nsound and look of some words have given clues to their\nmeaning: their sound has suggested their sense.</p>\n<p>I have been intrigued now and again, starting as a\nsmall boy, by words which seem to act in exactly the\nopposite fashion, words which point away from their\nmeaning, words which seem almost mischievously to\nmislead.  They suggest something other than what they\nmean and in some instances do so all the more effectively\nthe more one knows about words and etymology.\nVery often, of course, the misdirection lasts only for a\nsecond, until training and traditional knowledge take\nover.  The initial deception is no less real, and it is\nprecisely this that fascinates.  In parallel with the roots\nof <em>onomatopoeia (onoma</em> 'name' + <em>poiein</em> 'to make or\ndo') I have christened the effect <em>onomatoplazia: onoma</em>\nagain + <em>pladzein</em> 'to mislead or deceive.'  A fellow\nword-lover, flakier and less classically educated, suggested\n“offomatopoeia,” and my own pragmatic bent\nled at first toward “anti-onomatopoeia.”  But it seemed\nfinally better to be analogous rather than cleverly\nwhimsical or totally derivative.  Thus, <em>onomatoplazia</em>.</p>\n<p>I offer the following as a sampler of words that\ndelightfully and sometimes disconcertingly confuse.\nThey certainly did me when first I came across them.  I\nusually hazard a guess in such first encounters, <em>àla</em> the\ngame of “Dictionary.”  In all the following cases, the\nspelling, (apparent) roots, or sound of the word actively\nsuggest a meaning different from the true one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>noisome</em> Has nothing to do with sound or\ndecibel level, but means simply unpleasant or\ndisgusting.  This was the word that first caught\nmy eye as the obverse of onomatopoeia.</p>\n<p><em>highbinder</em> Not a hip-length legging nor a\nRocky Mountain farm implement, but incredibly\nenough a swindler or crook, especially of the\nChinese variety.</p>\n<p><em>macaronic</em> Does not refer to pasta; it is a\ntext which is half Latin and half vernacular.\n(The computer age term, “spaghetti code,”\nderives from the same pasta-related idea as\n<em>macaronic</em>, but more obviously so.)</p>\n<p><em>polymath</em> Does not describe my brownstone\npartner, who is in fact a Ph.D. in mathematics\nand who does indeed seem, at least to this\nphilosophy major, to know many kinds of\narithmetic.  The word, however, accurately\ndescribes him as a person of much and varied\nlearning.</p>\n<p><em>lowing</em> Has no reference to height or the lack\nof it, but is the sound commonly made by Oliver\nGoldsmith's herd.  Admittedly, <em>lowing</em> is also\nonomatopoeic.  Nonetheless, the initial <em>trompe\nl'oeil</em> is there.</p>\n<p><em>gingerly</em> Neither denotes nor connotes spice\nor snap or red hair, rather just their opposites:\ncautious, careful, wary.</p>\n<p><em>bosom pressers, breast buffers, chick\nsexers</em> Not names for denizens of Manhattan's\n42nd Street, although the functions suggested\ndoubtless occur there if the price is right.  These\nare job titles for, respectively:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a)  A clothing presser in the garment or dry-cleaning\nindustry who specializes.</p>\n<p>b)  A worker in a shoe factory who smooths and\npolishes the forepart of the heel, called the\n“breast” of the shoe in the trade.</p>\n<p>c)  An employee of a poultry farm who identifles\nthe gender of baby chicks so as to keep males\nand females apart (using a light!).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>crepuscular</em> Has always evoked for me images\nof muscles or funereal trimmings or infected\ntissue, instead of twilight or evening.</p>\n<p><em>crapulous, crapulent</em> What this suggests\nwould, of course, only occur to pre-pubescent\nboys and has nothing to do with the real\nmeaning of drunkenness, overeating.</p>\n<p><em>farthingale</em> Neither a singing, nocturnal\ncoin, nor a storm of flatulence, but the light\nwooden frame that puffed out milady's 16th-century\nskirt.</p>\n<p><em>pediculosis</em> Not as foot disease nor the bad\nbreath of children, but just plain (and literally)\nlousiness.</p>\n<p><em>impregnable</em> Non-English speakers have been\nknown to think this means inconceivable.</p>\n<p><em>hydrox</em> It is wildly improbable that this is\nthe name of a cookie and not a many-headed,\nbovine monster.</p>\n<p><em>catamite</em> Neither a light, fun sailboat, nor a\nsmall, feline bug, but a young boy used for\nunnatural purposes.</p>\n<p><em>newsprint</em> As a young boy I found it\nunnatural that this means merely paper.</p>\n<p><em>metapsychosis</em> One of the finest of traps for\nthe knowledgeable logophile: it has nothing to\ndo with some over-arching, society-wide\npsychological illness like alcoholism or jogging.\nRather, it means mind-to-mind communication\nwithout any observable intermediary—ESP.</p>\n<p><em>metaschizotherium</em> Not an over-arching,\nsociety-wide split personality, but mind\nblowingly enough an extinct rhino with a fivetoed\nfoot.</p>\n<p><em>over-determined</em> A misleading term in\npsychoanalytic jargon used to describe a\ncondition with many causes (thus, “<em>multi</em>-determined”\nwould be better).  This would\nlogically appear to be a technical psychological\ncoinage useful for referring to a personality or\ncondition that is excessively rigid or stubborn.</p>\n<p><em>analysand</em> Another term from psychoanalese:\none of its words for 'patient.'  This 19th-century\nneologism was obviously derived directly from\nthe -<em>nd</em> marker of the active gerund in Latin,\nwhich suggests the therapist (active agent) rather\nthan the patient (the recipient, the one the\ntreatment acts upon).  This doubtless reflects\npsychoanalytic theory's cherished insistence that\nthe patient actually does the analyzing in the\nlong run and thus is more truly the active\npartner.</p>\n<p><em>pogonip</em> Another sure-fire dictionary winner:\nnot a quick drink snatched while riding a\nbouncy stick, but a fog laden with particles of\nice.  This charmer is Shoshonean in origin, an\nexample of the onomatoplazia which readily\noccurs when the etymology in question is not\nfrom your usual, garden variety, linguistic roots.</p>\n<p><em>bosky</em> I was positive this was a new kind of\ndance or maybe a Pollyannaish feeling, until I\nlooked it up to find it means simply 'woodsy.'</p>\n<p><em>benthos</em> Neither an English social\nphilosopher nor a <em>petit bourgeois</em> weepy feeling,\nbut the bottom of the sea and by extension its\nflora and fauna.</p>\n<p><em>swimmingly</em> Has nothing to do with the\nsea—its bottom, its top, or its sports.  It just\nmeans 'well.'</p>\n<p><em>titmouse</em> Not any kind of rodent, noticeably\nmammalian or otherwise, but merely a small\nbird.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note</em>: this is an example of a “HobsonJobson”—foreign\nwords or expressions\ntwisted into a more familiar configuration\nby the pervasive influence of linguistic\nchauvinism, a rich source of\nonomatoplazia.  “The Elephant and\nCastle,” “nitwit,” and “big cheese” are\nother examples.  See Willard Espy's\ndelicious <em>An Almanac of Words at Play</em>,\npp. 21 and 203.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>oxymoron</em> Not a name for dumb cattle, but a\nrhetorical device that couples opposites into\ndescriptions effective for their irony: <em>cold as hell,\nhonest as a politician</em>.</p>\n<p><em>bar code</em> Not the ethics of the legal\nprofession nor the law that interferes with the\ncorner conviviality, but the small rectangle of\nstripes (bars) on store merchandise that provides\ncoded pricing and inventory information to\nelectronic scanners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These examples of onomatoplazia are a personal\nset, words that have led me astray.  There may be others\nwho have had the same experience with them.\nThere may also be additional examples which others\nmight like to drop into this intriguing piggin of words.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
