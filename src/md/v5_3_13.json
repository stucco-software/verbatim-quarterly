It happens in many editorial\noffices: someone comes up with a weird sort of joke that has\noccurred to him while his mind was wandering through the\norganization of the materials he was working with.  The next\nthing you know, the joke has become systematized into a\ngame, and the entire staff—all language-oriented—is playing\nit.  One such game was played at <em>Newsweek</em> in the mid-1940s,\nwhen I was employed there for a while in a capacity that I\nhave tried to forget and that <em>Newsweek</em> has probably consigned\nto the dustbin.  It consisted of translating popular English\nsongs (literally) into French and German.  “Ich werde dich\nwarden in einem Taxi, Honig,” was originally “I'll be down\nto get you in a taxi, Honey,” and “Y avait un gars.  Un gars\nqui était tout bizarre” had been “There was a boy, A very\nstrange, enchanted boy.”  Since some of those songs had actually\nbeen translated for consumption abroad.  I cannot any\nlonger be certain which were our translations and which the\n“official” ones.  But they were a lot of fun.
