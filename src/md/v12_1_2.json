On August 26,\nAlbino Cardinal Luciani, was selected to fill the vacancy\ncaused by the death of Pope Paul VI, and, to the astonishment\nof all, he adopted a double name.  There was another\ndeparture from custom: to the name he chose he added <em>I</em>,\n'the First,' although it was not customary for the first user of\na name to add the ordinal.  But this was a rather minor variance;\nthe major deviation was the double name, but Luciani\nhad reasons for both the name and the ordinal.</p>\n<p>The pope is known by many names, since each country\ntranslates his name into its own language.  John Paul II is\nGiovanni Paolo II in Italy, Jean Paul II in France and\nFrench Canada, and Juan Pablo II in Spain and Spanish\nAmerica.  He has but one official name, however, and that is\nhis name in Latin.  The name chosen by Albino Luciani in\nAugust, 1978, was <em>Ioannes Paulus Primus</em>; when asked why,\nhe spoke of his admiration for Pope John XXIII, adding\n“and Pope Paul made me a cardinal.”</p>\n<p>In political terms, we might describe Pope John XXIII\nas a liberal, and Paul as a conservative, somewhat to the\nright of center.  Cardinal Luciani clearly leaned toward\nJohn's views.  If we look closely at the Latin name he chose,\nwe find a play on words, for although Paulus is a name of\ngreat religious importance, it is also an adjective meaning\n'small.'</p>\n<p>And now a great light dawns.  The modest man who\nbecame pope in August 1978 (and died less than five weeks\nlater) had called himself 'Little John the First', because,\nalthough he hoped to follow in the footsteps of his great predecessor,\nJohn XXIII, he did not pretend to be his equal.\nFurthermore, by adding “the First,” he was expressing the\nhope that later popes would also follow the same liberal\nline.</p>\n<p>In the name of Pope John Paul I, therefore, we find a\nwhole philosophy and theology.  But even though his successor\ndid indeed choose the same name, John Paul II does not\nappear to have chosen the same philosophy.</p>",
