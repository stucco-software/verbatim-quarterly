I have acquired the habit, as\na lexicographer, of scribbling marginal notes in the\ndictionaries I use more or less regularly.  These range\nfrom queries regarding the accuracy and wording of\ndefinitions (which might be viewed as criticisms) to\nnotations of words and senses omitted (which can be\neither criticism, if the word or sense was known to\nhave existed at the time of compilcation, or mere commentary,\nif the word or sense appeared in the language\nlater on).  Thus, Johnson could be criticized for\nhaving got wrong the definition of <em>pastern</em> but could\nscarcely be taken to task for the “omission” of <em>telephone</em>\nor <em>electronics</em>.</p>\n<p>Rambling casually through my scribbling, I note,\nfor example, that neither edition of the <em>CED</em> carries\nthe generalized sense of <em>stonewall</em> 'obstruct,' though it\nhas been around for many years (and on both sides of\nthe Atlantic).  Properly, the sense '(<em>often passive</em>) to\nthwart; defeat' has been added to <em>snooker</em>.  On the\nother hand <em>snuck</em> 'a past tense or past participle of\n<em>sneak</em>,' labeled <em>“U.S., not standard</em>” in the earlier edition\nis now labeled <em>“U.S.</em>, <em>and Canadian</em>, <em>not standard</em>,”\nbut it ought to be labeled (in addition) “often\nhumorous.”  The cross reference under <em>SLR</em> to <em>reflex\ncamera</em> is an improvement over the earlier definition.\n<em>Shopfitter, shopfitting</em> ought to have been added, and\nthe verb definition of <em>concertina</em> 'to collapse or fold up\nlike a concertina' is not helpful without the appropriate\ninformation about how concertinas fold up, which\nought to have been in the noun definition for <em>concertina</em>,\na shortcoming in both editions.  <em>Résumé</em> is given a\npronunciation showing stress on the first syllable; but I\ncontinue to hear people in Britain, who seem to persist\nin an arch contempt for simulating French pronunciation,\nstressing it on the second: riZOOmi.  Other perverse\npronunciations (conTROVersy) are shown, but\nnot the pervasive REStauranTEUR, with its intrusive\n-<em>n</em>- (on both sides of the Pond).  The Americans have\nalso engaged in inducing strange shifts of stress into\nsome words; one that amuses is the shift from AFFluent\nto afFLUent, possibly to avoid any confusion with\na word from the vocabulary of ecology that has\nintruded into the popular language: EFFluent.  Possibly\nthe thing to be avoided is an effluence of affluence,\nthe affluence of effluents, or some other such peril.</p>\n<p>Focusing on a run of words at the beginning of Q,\na few of the types of changes made in the new edition\nbecome evident.  The editors seem to have found sufficient\nevidence for the dropping of periods in abbreviations\nin modern (British) practice to have eliminated\nmany of them entirely, without even showing the\nolder forms as variants: <em>QARANC</em>, <em>QB</em>, <em>QC</em>, <em>QED</em>,\n<em>QEF</em>, <em>QF</em>, <em>ql</em>, <em>qm</em> (but <em>q.l.</em> remains), <em>Qld</em>, <em>QM</em>, <em>QMC</em>,\n<em>QMG</em>, <em>QMS</em>, and so on.  Notwithstanding evidence\ngleaned from modern sources, which I cannot question,\nit seems to me that there is a sufficiently large\nbody of older evidence in existence to warrant the listing\nof these with their traditional full stops.  In the\nsame interval, <em>Q</em> to <em>quadraphonics</em>, there appear several\nchanges and a number of new entries: <em>QANTAS,\nQingdao, Qinghai, Qiqihar, Q-methodology, Qom,\nQSM, Q-sort, quad</em> (for <em>quadraphonic), quadr</em>- (var.\nof <em>quadri</em>-).  The Chinese place names show commendable\nattention paid to the Pinyin transliteration of\nentries formerly entered under spellings conforming to\nother systems for transliteration.  <em>Pinyin</em> did not make\nit into the 1979 edition, but it is there now.</p>\n<p>It would be unfair to evaluate each of these\naddenda on its own merits, and that is not the point of\nthis exercise.  The point is to demonstrate that there are\na great many new entries—more than 10,000 according\nto a comparison of claims made in the jacket\nblurbs of the two editions—and, though it would be\ntedious to document other changes here, it is clear that\nevery entry in the old book was examined and\nreviewed and that little has slipped past the editor's\neagle eye.  Even <em>propitiatory</em>, for some reason omitted\nfrom the first edition, has been added.</p>\n<p>This new edition is well worth buying: if you\nhave the earlier one and have become accustomed to\nits style, you will need this updated and revised edition;\nif you do not have the 1979 edition, here is an\nopportunity to avail yourself of a superior work of lexicographic\nreference.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
