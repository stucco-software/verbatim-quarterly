The mail brings you additions\nto the growing list you've fashioned.  Some meet the mark; the\nmajority sadly miss.

Even if I\nspot a few faces I know have been in earlier groups, I still offer\na selective sprinkling, just to generate that flow of mail I know\nwill follow.</p>\n<p>I just cannot pass up the chance of collecting a great new\noxymoron.
