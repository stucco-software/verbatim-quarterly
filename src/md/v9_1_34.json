Several years later, when a new generation rebelled\nagainst lifeless commercial music and found yet new ways to\nshock their elders, someone in the media lifted <em>punk</em> from 1966\nand applied it to the Ramones in the U.S. and to the Sex Pistols\nin England.  I don't know whether or not Greg Shaw accepts\nthis new usage for his label, <em>Bomp</em> Records.</p>\n<p>It's logical to assume that <em>punk</em> as a sexually dominated\nman in prison came from <em>punk</em> 'prostitute,' a woman sexually\ndominated (usually by a pimp) and subject to her clients'\ndemands.  If this is the case, <em>punk-rocker</em> also descended from\nthe latter usage.</p>\n<p><em>[Richard Stooker, St. Louis, Missouri]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
