When I saw the gaffe he had committed with\n“normal usage,” I supposed it had resulted from an isolated\ninstance of confusion.  At about the point I read about\n<em>epiphora</em>, however, my eyes began to water—in the act of\ncomplaining about “inconsistencies and inaccuracies,” Mr.\nMcC. is contributing several more inconsistencies to the pages\nof VERBATIM.  His confusion over <em>hendiadys</em> and its “normal\nusage” is only one illustration.  (More on another illustration in\na moment.)</p>\n<p>As Mr. McC. has discovered, <em>hendiadys</em> is treated twice in\nMr. Espy's book: on p. 178 in an excerpt from the Rev.\nPeacham's 1577 book, and on p. 133 in a comment on\ncontemporary usage.  So, when Mr. McC. quotes from p. 133,\nhe uses “normal usage” in the way Mr. Espy does there, to\nmean usage here in the 1980s.  When Mr. McC. applies the\nexpression “normal usage” to the quotation from p. 178,\nhowever, isn't he suddenly setting himself up to judge an\nElizabethan writer's usage by our contemporary standards?\nAfter all, the Rev. Peacham's illustration (“He is a man of great\nwisdom...”) <em>does</em> satisfy the Rev. Peacham's definition (“...\nwhen a Substantive is put for an Adjective of the same\nsignification”), just as Mr. Espy's illustrations satisfy Mr. Espy's\ndefinition.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Mr. McC.'s reference to “the definition of\n<em>hendiadys</em> given earlier” is odd.  If he means chronologically\nearlier, then of course the definition on p. 178—the Rev.\nPeacham's—is by far the earlier one.  If Mr. McC. is calling the\none from p. 133 “earlier,” though, isn't he being more than a\nbit careless?  When differences in definition four centuries apart\nreflect differences in usage, isn't it more useful to acknowledge\nthe differences than to blur them?</p>\n<p>A gaffe that seems far more unfortunate involves Mr.\nMcC.'s rigid distinction between <em>epiphora</em> and <em>epistrophe</em>.  I\nconfirm that <em>Webster's Third</em> defines <em>epiphora</em> as “watering of\nthe eyes,” a definition reassuringly similar to the first definition\nthe OED gives for the same term.  So far, so good—although the\nOED's second definition, labeled <em>Rhet.</em>, suggests that at least in\nthe past epiphora did mean “a rhetorical device containing the\nsame word or phrase at the end of successive clauses” (if I may\nquote from Mr. McC.'s letter again).  The <em>OED's</em> example is\nfrom a seventeenth-century dictionary, whose explanation of\n<em>epiphora</em> closely parallels the Rev.  Peacham's as Mr. Espy\nquotes it on p. 178.</p>\n<p>I could go on, but I think I have written enough to raise\nthe question—<em>where's the beef?</em></p>\n<p><em>[Dennis Moore, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
