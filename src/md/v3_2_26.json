Ruster [II, 3] that “it is a peculiarly Celtic trait [to reckon] people and things in sets of twenty,” I think it worthwhile to note modern Danish ordinal numbers, which have an obvious historical root in a base-20 system.  These numbers are: <em>ti</em> (10), <em>tyve</em> (20), <em>tredive</em> (30), <em>fyrre</em> (40), <em>halvtreds</em> (50), <em>tres</em> (60), <em>halvfjerds</em> (70), <em>firs</em> (80), <em>halvfems</em> (90), and <em>hundrede</em> (100).  Until very recent decades, 50 through 90 were rendered with the suffix -<em>sindstyve</em>.  <em>Halvtredsindstyve</em>, for example, yields a morpheme-by-morpheme translation as <em>half (halv), three (tre), times (sinds), twenty (tyve)</em>. “Half-three” is equivalent to 2½, so what we have in the number is an equation, 2½ x 20 (=50).  The western-oriented Swedes, who speak a very similar language, dispensed with this system, substituting for 50, for example, <em>femti</em>, or <em>five-ten</em>, which yields another equation, 5 x 10 (=50).  The Norwegians have followed suit, and I suppose it is only a matter of time before the Danes do likewise.   <em>[Frank Willard Riggs, Orem, Utah]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
