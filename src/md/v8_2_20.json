One of the more\npopular restaurants is called “New Joe,” which became\nso widely known that it soon inspired an imitator who\ncalled himself “Original Joe,” and that, in turn,\nspawned a branch known as “Original Joe No. 2,” a neat\ntrick and they did it.  Thus we find that “Original Joe” is\nnewer than, and not as original as, “new Joe.”  The\nconfusion became complete recently when what should\nopen across the street from “New Joe's” but a restaurant\nthat calls itself “Original Junior.”  ... Such is life in\nNorth Beach, where There's No Business Like Joe\nBusiness, [from <em>Baghdad by the Bay</em>, by Herb Caen,\nPermabooks, 1953, pp. 152-3; submitted by Jack Calvert,\nSan Francisco.]</p>",
