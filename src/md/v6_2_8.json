Mustard flowers are, of course, yellow; so Mr.\nEisiminger's 'to see yellow' is not misleading.  However, his\ninterpretation (that the idiom means “to lapse into unconsciousness”)\nis questionable.  <em>Sharshe phul dekha</em> is the equivalent\nof English <em>to see stars</em>.  One may “see stars” upon being\nstunned by a blow without necessarily lapsing into unconsciousness.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>rage nil</em> is definitely not 'scared blue.'  <em>Rag</em> means\n<em>anger</em> in Bengali, not fear.  The -<em>e</em> is a suffix that is roughly the\nequivalent of the English preposition “in” (or “with”).  So\n“enraged blue” or “blue with anger” would be the appropriate\ntranslation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>rage lal</em> is not 'yellow and red' as claimed by Mr.\nEisiminger.  Since <em>lal</em> means <em>red</em> in Bengali, the logic of (2) indicates\nthat the phrase should be translated as “enraged red”\nor “red with anger.”  Curiously enough, in this second use of\n<em>rage</em> Mr. Eisiminger does note that <em>rag</em> means <em>anger</em>.  In the\nearlier example he took it to mean <em>fear</em>.  The other important\npoint is that since there is no reference to the color yellow in\nthis phrase (and red is the only color involved), one cannot\nuse <em>rage lal</em> as an example of compound colors.  The paragraph\nin which Mr. Eisiminger uses this phrase happens to be\ndevoted to compound colors and so this example simply does\nnot belong with the examples of compound colors.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>[P.K.
