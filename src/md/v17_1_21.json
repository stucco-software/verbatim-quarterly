There are many extremely abstruse\nnotions in linguistics, and if any one might find\nuseful a brief summarization [<em>sic</em>] of many of the linguistic\nphilosophies of the past 150 years, this is a\nconvenient, minimalist approach.  I say “minimalist”\nbecause the ideas are watered down, then doubledistilled,\nthen compressed, then encapsulated.  Because\nlinguists are atrociously bad writers, in most\ncases, this would be a merciful deliverance from the\nagony of wading through their texts at first hand\nwere it not for the unfortunate fact that Andersen is\na pretty boring writer himself.  Also, it would have\nbeen useful (and not necessarily munificent) to have\nprovided such a book with a reasonably replete index.\nAlas, that is also a barebones affair.

But that may merely be\nreflective of my own interests, or does not reflect\nthe author's readings, or, probably, both.  Well, one\ncannot have everything, and, as I sometimes maintain\nbut rarely believe, a book should be reviewed\nfor what it contains and not condemned for what it\nomits.</p>\n<p>If you are a professional linguist, you can pass\nthis one by, unless you teach and need a crib for\nyour students.  If you are a student of linguistics (in\nany sense of the term), you might find it convenient\nto have this book to save your running to the multivolume\nencyclopedia or the original text (if you have\nit) in order to see what B. F. Skinner and Noam\nChomsky were on about.  Had it been more complete\nand better done, the book might have served\nas a survey text for linguistics, a work that is sorely\nneeded.  The linguists who write books seem invariably\nto be scholars who are touting their own points\nof view, some of which are recondite, to say the\nleast.  Surely there must be a teaching linguist out\nthere, somewhere, capable of putting together a cogent,\nreadable text that discusses not only the field\nof linguistics but its various theories and their interrelations.\nUnfortunately, there has not been a good\n(bookwriting) linguist who was also a good writer of\nexpository prose since Otto Jespersen, the Santayana\nof linguistics, and he died in 1943.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
