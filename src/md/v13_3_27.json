What has happened to excellence?</p>\n<p>We in the United States have always claimed\nleadership in technology.  Can we then allow such slipshod,\ncareless work?  Do we accept the publication of\nerror-laden material by our foremost publishing\nhouses?  If we continue to buy these books without\ncomment or protest, we tacitly sanction defective\nproducts and denigrate the position of our country in\nevery sphere.</p>\n<p>Why not instead make ourselves heard in the market\nplace?  Let us resolve that from now on we shall\nnotice and denounce all departures from good usage.\nLet us demand, yes, <em>insist</em> upon careful screening,\nunerring proofreading, top-quality editorial and production\nsupervision for all the books we read.</p>\n<p><em>AND LADIES OF THE CLUB</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>PAGE</em></th>\n<th><em>READS</em></th>\n<th><em>SHOULD READ</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>37</td>\n<td>Vigil</td>\n<td>Virgil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>42</td>\n<td>wags</td>\n<td>was</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>76</td>\n<td>whim</td>\n<td>whom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>99</td>\n<td>he</td>\n<td>she</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>135</td>\n<td>wws</td>\n<td>was</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>182</td>\n<td>not</td>\n<td>now</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>188</td>\n<td>this</td>\n<td>his</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>215</td>\n<td>war</td>\n<td>were</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>215</td>\n<td>should put</td>\n<td>should have put</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>306</td>\n<td>come to the help</td>\n<td>came to the help</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>323</td>\n<td>henna</td>\n<td>Hanna</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>357</td>\n<td>peof</td>\n<td>pair of</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>376</td>\n<td>Waht</td>\n<td>What</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>389</td>\n<td>One the evening</td>\n<td>On the evening</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>390</td>\n<td>Baron munchausen</td>\n<td>Baron Munchausen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>391</td>\n<td>Binney</td>\n<td>Binny</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>409</td>\n<td>althought</td>\n<td>although</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>433</td>\n<td>cannot managed</td>\n<td>cannot manage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>549</td>\n<td>Capain</td>\n<td>Captain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>624</td>\n<td>though</td>\n<td>thought</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>645</td>\n<td>though</td>\n<td>thought</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>654</td>\n<td>one evening when was late</td>\n<td>one evening when he was late</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>717</td>\n<td>better that Mark</td>\n<td>better than Mark</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>722</td>\n<td>I was quite true</td>\n<td>It was quite true</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>732</td>\n<td>Barara</td>\n<td>Barbara</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>794</td>\n<td>go of</td>\n<td>go off</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>849</td>\n<td>Lugwig</td>\n<td>Ludwig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>853</td>\n<td>Buy</td>\n<td>But</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>859</td>\n<td>went back to standy</td>\n<td>went back to stand</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>864</td>\n<td>unkept</td>\n<td>unkempt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>873</td>\n<td>judgement</td>\n<td>judgment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>884</td>\n<td>mther</td>\n<td>mother</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>885</td>\n<td>Nor Jessamine</td>\n<td>Nor could Jessamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>918</td>\n<td>change you mind</td>\n<td>change your mind</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>918</td>\n<td>I won't changed</td>\n<td>I won't change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>921</td>\n<td>her were</td>\n<td>he were</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>943</td>\n<td>pretened</td>\n<td>pretend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>945</td>\n<td>could no forbear</td>\n<td>could not forbear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>949</td>\n<td>the only Rausch Paul's wife really knew</td>\n<td>Out of context.
