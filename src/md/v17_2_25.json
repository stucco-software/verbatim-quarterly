One can also assume that in\nthe United States a <em>pub</em> is at least one step above a\n<em>bar</em>, although a <em>saloon</em> may be a par with a <em>pub</em>\nsince it connotes by-gone as opposed to a British\n(and therefore old-world) elegance.</p>\n<p>Within the past five or six years, however, I\nhave observed that elegance has come to be a matter\nof phase rather than diction.  <em>The White House Inn</em>,\nfor example, has become <em>The White House a Country\nInn</em>.  Note there is no punctuation in the phrase\nnor a capital letter on the second article, and it is the\nsecond article that appears to be a key.  (I should\nnote that all examples come from establishments in\nand around the more “elegant” resorts of Vermont\nand New Hampshire, although I have witnessed the\nphenomenon in many parts of parts of the country).</p>\n<p>The article in the second half of the phrase,\nboth makes the phrase appositional and indicates the\nupgrading of the referent.  One example is <em>Meredith\nStation a Restaurant a Grill a Niteclub;</em> this location\nwould appear to give the establishment a greater cachet\nthan <em>Meredith Station, Restaurant, Grill and\nNiteclub</em> and certainly more than <em>Meredith Bar and\nGrill</em>.  The series in this example helps to establish a\nset of alternative uses of Meredith Station and the\nrhythm appears to suggest mounting excitement.</p>\n<p>The apposition is to be distinguished from the\nadjectival modifier such as <em>Barney's Good food in a\nCountry Atmosphere</em>, which serves to describe more\nprecisely the type of establishment the motorist is\napproaching.  Such phrases as <em>Family Restaurant</em> and\n<em>Country Dining</em> give clues to the eye as to expense\nand dress as well as to the establishment's attitude\ntowards children and perhaps charge cards.  Normally\nthey are not prefixed by an article.</p>\n<p>Appositions abound in some areas of the country\nand not restricted to restaurants.  They seem\nto be a mainstay of condominium resorts like <em>The\nMargate at Winnepesaukee a Premier Lakes Region\nResort</em> (which suggests ownership); <em>Winterberry a\nResort Village;</em> and <em>Moon Ridge a Point of View</em>,\nwhich contains a nice whimsy.  One can also see appositions\napplied to barbers and hairdressers who go\nto great lengths to distinguish themselves.  <em>Split\nEnds a Cosmetology Shop</em> is a nice example of appositional\nelegance combined with euphemism in the\nappositive and the low key or off-beat opening.  <em>Colanders\nThe Vermont Housewares Outlet</em> uses the definite\narticle in the apposition to suggest both uniqueness\nand some official status.  This use differs from\nthe use of the appositional, <em>The Movie</em>, or <em>The Book</em>,\nwhich gives the reader a sense of connection with\nsome previous experience.</p>\n<p>The use of the appositive to elevate appears to\nbe a commercial manifestation of titular colonicity,\nthe phenomenon noted first by J.T. Dillon in 1981.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a1\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup>  The phrase refers, of course to the use of\ncolons in titles of scholarly works.  Dillon argues that\nthe prestige of a field can be empirically determined\nthrough the counting of the percentage of colons in a\na corpus.  He demonstrates his point through a comparison\nof three fields: literature, psychology, and\neducation and their increasing use of colons in titles\nin the 1970s and 1980s.  Literature led the way but\nthe other fields have caught up.  Dillon's article is a\nmasterly socio-graphic analysis.</p>\n<p>It would seem that the commercial world has\nseen the power of titular colonicity but has had to\ndevise its own manifestation.  A colon makes sense\non a title page.  But would it work on a billboard?  I\nthink not; therefore the appositive.  The device is\nnot without its pitfalls however, as witness the following:\n<em>Henry David's a Restaurant</em>.  The combination\nof the possessive and the apposition creates a\nsolecism unless we assume that a word was omitted—perhaps\n<em>Pub</em> or <em>Saloon</em>.  I have passed the sign\nseveral times in the past few years and recently\nnoted that it had been cleaned and repainted, but\nthe apostrophe remains.  What Henry David possesses\nremains an enigma.  But we know that it must\nbe an “upscale” restaurant.</p>\n<hr>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-a1\">\n<p>J.T.
