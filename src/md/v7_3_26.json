This\nchunky book contains much information about the English\nlanguage and its origins, with some chapters on etymology\n(indeed, most of the book deals with the various sources of\nwords in English), some on names, and a relatively short\nsection called “How to Construct Crossword Puzzles.” The\ntext reflects the author's personal biases—which is as it\nshould be—and the style of writing is somewhat dull, at\nleast if one compares it with that of a Willard Espy. The\n20-page section on crossword-puzzle construction is neither\nas complete nor as helpful as <em>The Compleat Cruciverbalist,</em>\nreviewed elsewhere in this issue, and, since I am looking at\nuncorrected page proofs, I cannot tell what sort of illustrations\nare likely to be included in the final work.</p>\n<p>I generally view with approbation any work that offers\nnew and different ways of looking at English, and Mr.\nMaleska has organized his book so that all the words of\nCreek, Latin, Italian, and other origins are discussed in\ntheir respective chapters. Obviously, none of these treatments\nis exhaustive, and most of the book reads pretty much\nlike a list of etymologies that have been rewritten in readable\nlanguage, rescued from the abbreviated style found in\nmost dictionaries. Thus, there isn't very much here that is\nnovel, and some of it is a bit misleading: what, for instance,\nis the point of going into long descriptions of words like <em>fettucine,\nfra diavolo, gnocchi,</em> and so on, when they are\nclearly loan words? Giving definitions of these words is not\nparticularly helpful, and learning that the (Italian) meaning\nof <em>fettucine</em> is 'little ribbons' is not particularly revealing.\nThis sort of thing goes on page after page for the various\nlanguages covered, and if that is your cup of tea, you will\nwant to buy the book. An appendix lists words with definitions,\nsome roots with their derivatives, and answers to\nquizzes that appear here and there. The bibliography\n(promised in the table of contents but not shown in the\nproofs received) should prove interesting. There is no listing\nfor an index in the table of contents, and I hope there will\nbe one, for without one it would be difficult to find again\nthe information contained in this book once it has been\nread.</p>\n<p>[L.U.]</p>\n<h1></h1>",
