Most are not in any dictionaries\nand, should be recorded, opinions notwithstanding.\nSix short essays (chapters) dealing with various aspects\nof the development of <em>buzzwords</em> precede the glossary.\nMueller is really a <em>wired in white hat</em> for the <em>verbal\nmodel</em> he has provided.  As long as we continue to be\nbombarded by phrases like <em>B.O.</em> and <em>biological stain</em>, and\nmeaningless expressions like “It's the real thing--Coke is!”\nand “The Pepsi generation,” we shall need a Mueller to\nrecord and interpret what's going on.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
