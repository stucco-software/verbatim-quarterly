The answers are <em>armature, ghosting,</em> and <em>half in half out.</em> Marc McCutcheon has supposedly provided us with yet another way of wrenching information from the language that it does not readily yield up: people are always yearning for a “reverse dictionary,” and such books have been around for years. It is difficult to evaluate them because their usefulness depends very largely on whether the user's mind works in the same way as the compiler's. Thus, for example, I could never make much sense out of <em>Bernstein's Reverse Dictionary,</em> for, although Ted and I were good friends, our thought processes were not the same, and I would tend to look up a word I wanted in a completely different part of his book from where it was listed.</p>\n<p>McCutcheon's <em>Descriptionary</em> is like a collection of specialized glossaries. There are no illustrations; there are twenty major headings (like Environment, Animals, Human Body and Mind) and more subheadings than I cared to count (thirty under Environment, eight under Animals, fifteen under Human Body and Mind). None of them is very long, so one need not look very far through the entries and definitions to find that “removal of a kidney” is called a <em>nephrectomy.</em> That is all very well, and the convenience of having such glossaries cannot be overemphasised. But let me offer an illustration of the kind of problem I encounter: on the back of the dust jacket some copy editor (presumably) has suggested that “With the flip of a page through <em>Descriptionary,</em> any racetrack layman can transform a dull paragraph like this—”...“into a professional sports report like this—....” The two paragraphs show the following substitutions: <em>chalk horse</em> for “favourite”; <em>card</em> for “racing program”; <em>field</em> for “horses”; <em>fast</em> for “dry, hard”; <em>an armchair ride</em> for “without the jockey ever having to whip him”; and <em>homestretch</em> for “last leg of the race.” Wondering if that could possibly work, I tried to find the appropriate section in the table of contents. I looked for “Horseracing” under Sports; it wasn't there (among the 31 subglossaries listed), but a further search revealed “Thoroughbred Racing.” It is fortunate that the list of subglossaries is short, for it would not have occurred to me to look for such a heading, though I readily concede it makes sense. Turning to the section, it became immediately apparent that I would have been unable to make the substitutions suggested: in the first place, terms like <em>favourite, racing program</em>, and <em>horses</em> are not entries in the glossary, and one would have to find them by reading the entire glossary from start to finish to see in which definitions they occur. There is no Index, and neither the subglossaries nor the main sections are in alphabetical order, which is irritating and unforgivable.</p>\n<p>I was put off by the front of the dust jacket, too: a cartoon character is shown wondering what the name is for the white crescent-shaped area at the base of a fingernail. Assuming that the word might be listed in one of the several subglossaries under Human Body and Mind, I looked there. The word— <em>lunula</em>, by the way—is nowhere to be found. Is this the publisher's symbolic way of giving, readers the finger? In general, coverage is extremely uneven.</p>\n<p>The fact that the person who wrote the jacket copy had only a fanciful idea of the uses to which the book can be put does not necessarily diminish its usefulness. There are other errors, however. <em>Athwartship</em> is not used in the same way as <em>abeam</em>, and <em>abeam</em> does not mean “at right angles to the vessel,” which is a poor definition at best; thus, at <em>square-rigged</em>, the definition is awkwardly unidiomatic: “having foursided sails set abeam or athwartships.” There are other faults, not the least of which is the use of <em>the</em> for <em>a</em> or <em>an</em> in definitions, which, were McCutcheon not credited with other dictionaries (which I have not seen) would brand him an amateur lexicographer. “Jejunem” is so misspelled under <em>ileum</em>, “pudenal block” is shown as an entry (p.99), and the same terms with slightly different definitions appear in different places (e.g., under Organs and Glands (p. 69) and under Digestive System (p. 79).</p>\n<p>Whether one should acquire the <em>Descriptionary</em> or not will depend on how frustrated and desperate one becomes at not being able to find the word that is at the tip of one's tongue.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
