Many blends, including\nmost of those reported here, are nonce creations\nthat never achieve the immortality of a lexicographical\nrecord.  Although they are of little importance\nas words, they are noteworthy as examples of a\nkind of word-making and as artifacts of homo loquens\net jocans.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the simplest kind of blend is one that\ncombines two synonyms, such as <em>chopter</em>, spoken by a\ntelevision announcer, who might have said either\n<em>chopper</em> or <em>copter</em>, but who in fact succeeded in saying\nboth more or less simultaneously.  Similar is <em>bonk</em>\n(<em>bang</em> + <em>conk</em>) in “A door nearly bonked her in the\nface.”  This kind of blend, dubbed a 'portmaneau” by\nLewis Carroll, is often a deliberate creation rather\nthan a lapsus linguae.  It may also combine, not synonyms,\nbut words of contrastive meaning; the resulting\nword unites both the forms and the senses of the\nsources into a hermaphroditic tertiun quid.  The following\nare examples: <em>beautility</em> (<em>beauty</em> + <em>utility</em>),\n<em>dat</em> (<em>dog</em> + <em>cat</em>, a crossbred hoax), <em>Demopublican</em>\n(<em>Democrat</em> + <em>Republican</em>, another crossbreed, though\nno hoax), <em>diplonomics</em> (<em>diplomacy</em> + <em>economics</em>, use\nof economic power for diplomatic ends), <em>frarority</em>\n(<em>fraternity</em> + <em>sorority</em>, a college social organization\nthat admits both sexes), <em>gasit indigestion</em> (<em>gas</em> + <em>acid\nindigestion</em>, a minor medical complaint which, if television\nadvertisements are to be believed, afflicts most\nof the population), <em>glommentary</em> (<em>glossary</em> + <em>commentary</em>,\nsuch as the present remarks), <em>Hinglish</em>\n(<em>Hindi</em> + <em>English</em>), <em>Hungarican</em> (<em>Hungarian</em> +\n<em>American</em>), <em>Italish</em> (<em>Italian</em> + <em>English</em>), <em>ninny</em> (<em>nickel</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>penny</em>, a proposed 2½¢ coin), <em>pickel</em> (<em>penny</em> +\n<em>nickel</em>, the same; according to Mr. Bert Casper of\nWhite Bear Lake, Minnesota, who proposed the terms,\nthe second commemorates the present economic situation,\nand the first those who are responsible for it),\n<em>slumpflation</em> (<em>slump</em> + <em>inflation</em>, the economic situation\nitself).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A quite different sort of blend is that made by shortening\nthe parts of an expression and collapsing them into\na single word.  This kind of blend, appropriately called a\n“telescope,” may be a lapse, such as <em>darly</em> in “This time of\nyear, its gets darly...I mean, dark early.”  Or it may be\ndeliberate, such as the motion picture title <em>Zardoz</em> (<em>Wizard\nof Oz</em>).  Other examples, based on more or less set phrases,\nare <em>adflation</em> (<em>advertising inflation</em>, the high cost of ads),\n<em>administrivia</em> (<em>administrative trivia</em>, what most administrators\ndo most of the time), <em>bitini</em> (<em>bitsy bikini</em>), <em>ecotecture</em>\n(<em>ecological architecture</em>, the practice of amateurs who build\ntheir own houses), <em>feminar</em> (<em>feminine seminar</em>, a meeting for\nwomen), <em>femsymp</em> (<em>feminine movement sympathizer</em>, by\nanalogy with <em>comsymp</em>), <em>flextime</em> (<em>flexible time</em>, an arrangement\nthat permits workers to set their own schedules),\n<em>medevac</em> (<em>medical evacuation</em>, as from a battlefield\nor a rock concert—the sense 'military helicopter,' which has\nbeen lexicographically recorded, is probably a metaphorical\nextension of this more basic, but unrecorded sense),\n<em>thmink</em> (<em>think mink</em>, sign in a fur shop window, a purely\ngraphic blend perhaps inspired by a burlesque of the IBM\nmotto: THIMK), <em>vodkatini</em> (<em>vodka martini</em>).</p>\n<p>Halfway between the pure portmanteau and the pure\ntelescope is a kind of blend that combines words which\ncollocate together, though not in a set phrase.  They seem\nto be always self-conscious linguistic stunts (to use Louise\nPound's happy term).  Such blends, which may be called\n“jumbles,” are the following: <em>bibulography</em> (the biography\nof a bibulous person), <em>Californication</em> (unplanned and uncontrolled\ndevelopment of a region, such as the way California\nhas been fornicated up), <em>econodations</em> (a lemma in\nthe yellow pages for accommodations at an Econo-Travel\nMotor Hotel), <em>hashaholic</em> (one addicted to hashish as an\nalcoholic is to alcohol), <em>hymnenanny</em> (a religiously oriented\nhootenanny), <em>imagineer</em> (a monthly award for an\nengineer with imaginative ideas), <em>McGovernment</em> (governmental\npolicies advocated by George McGovern), <em>Nixnik</em>\n(a member of the White House staff under Richard\nNixon), <em>Nova Scotiable</em> (sociable, in a manner characteristic\nof Nova Scotia, with thanks to A. M. Kinloch for the\nterm), <em>plotboiler</em> (a literary work with a trite, improbable\nplot), <em>pornicator</em> (a producer, performer, or purveyor of\nvicarious libidinous stimulation), <em>rumortism</em> (a chronic inflammation\nof the body politic), <em>sextrovert</em> (one in no need\nof the services of a pornicator), <em>tripewriter</em> (a typewriter\nused exclusively for political speeches), <em>Vietgate</em> (a view\nof political morality that equates the sins of Vietniks with\nthose of Nixniks), <em>Vietnik</em> (one who publicly opposed the\ngovernment's Vietnam policy), <em>watergaffe</em> (a bungled effort\nto suppress a French humor magazine), <em>wordsical</em> (a\ntheatrical performance that blends music with the recitation\nof Ogden Nash's verse).</p>\n<p>In popular use, the term <em>blend</em> is used for any word\nformed by shortening one word and combining what is left\nwith all or part of another.  There are, however, three distinct\nsubspecies: portmanteaus, which combine words that\nmight substitute for one another; telescopes, which combine\nwords that occur side by side in an expression; and\njumbles, which combine words between which there is\nsome association, although they are neither properly substitutes\nnor the sequential elements of a structure.  All three\nsubspecies are favored by present-day wordsters, as the\nexamples cited clearly show.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
