And the English language is rich in terms to describe\nthose sounds. As Watts noted, dogs <em>bark</em> and bears and\nlions <em>growl</em>. Some such English terms apply to different\nspecies of nonhuman creatures; for example, both insects\nand birds <em>churr</em>. Others denote a particular nonhuman\nsound but, at the same time, serve other purposes: cranes\nand geese <em>clang</em> but so do bells and streetcars. There are, on\nthe other hand, some terms that are highly particularized.\nWhat <em>quacks</em> other than a duck? And what <em>oinks</em> other than\na pig? It may also be observed that for many nonhuman\ncreatures, there is more than one applicable English word.\nTake, for example, the two most common animals, namely,\ncats and dogs. Cats <em>caterwaul, mew, miaou (or meow),\nmeaul, purr, and yowl</em>, while dogs <em>bark, bay, growl, howl,\nsnarl, yap, yelp, and yowl</em>. Dogs can also <em>cry</em>, although that\nterm is generally reserved for hounds, as is <em>bay</em>.</p>\n<p>Terms that are applicable to the various barnyard denizens,\nanimal and fowl, include the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>bulls bellow</em> and <em>roar</em><br>\n<em>hens cackle, chuck,</em><br>\n<em>cows bellow, low,</em> and <em>moo</em><br>\n<em>chuckle, cluck,</em> and <em>gabble</em><br>\n<em>calves blat</em> and <em>bleat</em><br>\nchicks <em>cheep</em> and <em>peep</em><br>\n<em>asses</em> and <em>donkeys bray</em><br>\nroosters <em>cock, cock-a-</em><br>\n<em>goats bleat</em><br>\n<em>doodle-doo,</em> and <em>crow</em><br>\n<em>pigs grunt, squeal,</em> and <em>oink</em><br>\nhen turkeys <em>yelp</em><br>\n<em>horses neigh, nicker, snort,</em><br>\ntom  turkeys <em>gobble</em><br>\n<em>whicker,</em> and <em>whinny</em><br>\n<em>geese cackle, clang, cronk,</em><br>\n<em>sheep baa, blat,</em> and <em>bleat</em><br>\n<em>gabble, hiss,</em> and <em>honk</em><br>\nducks <em>quack</em> and <em>squawk</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Applicable terms for our feathered friends of the sky\nare just as numerous, if not more so. Birds in general <em>chatter,\nchirrup, chitter, pipe, squall, trill, twitter</em>, and <em>whistle</em>,\nwhile fledglings <em>cheep, chirp, peep</em>, and <em>tweet</em>. Specific\nspecies also do their specific things:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>bitterns <em>boom</em><br>\nnightingales and partridges <em>churr</em><br>\ncranes <em>clang</em> and <em>whoop</em><br>\ncrows <em>caw</em> and <em>croak</em><br>\nowls <em>hoot, screech, tu-whit,</em> <em>tu-whoo,</em> and <em>whoop</em><br>\ncuckoos <em>cuckoo</em><br>\neagles <em>scream</em><br>\npigeons and doves <em>coo</em><br>\ngulls <em>cry</em> and <em>mew</em><br>\nravens <em>caw, croak,</em> and <em>cronk</em><br>\nhawks <em>cry</em><br>\nsnipes <em>scape</em><br>\nrooks <em>caw</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Terms available for various species of wildlife include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>elephants <em>trumpet</em><br>\nbears <em>growl</em><br>\nlions <em>growl, roar,</em> and <em>snarl</em><br>\nrutting deer <em>bell</em><br>\nmonkeys <em>chatter</em><br>\nbucks <em>troat</em><br>\njackals <em>wail</em><br>\nsquirrels <em>chatter</em><br>\nwolves <em>howl</em><br>\nmice <em>cheep, peep,</em> and <em>squeak</em><br>\nfoxes* bark, yap,* and <em>yelp</em><br>\nbats <em>cheep</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Insects also have their distinctive terms. Insects in\ngeneral can be said to <em>chirp, churr</em>, and <em>trill</em>, while specific\nterms for specific insects include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>bees <em>boom, buzz, drone,</em><br>\ngrasshoppers and locusts and <em>hum</em><br>\n<em>chirr, crick,</em> and <em>whirr</em><br>\ncrickets <em>chirp</em> and <em>creak</em><br>\nmosquitoes and gnats <em>hum</em> and <em>trumpet</em><br>\nbeetles <em>boom, drone,</em> and <em>hum</em><br>\nAlso, frogs <em>croak</em> and <em>pipe,</em> and snakes <em>hiss</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I doubt very much that these terms include all that are\ncontained in the English lexicon, and readers who are ardent\nlogophiles will very likely be able to add others. If they\ncan't the paleomorphophiliacs certainly should be able to do\nso. In that connection, I might note that in her delightful\nbook on archaic English words, <em>Poplollies and Bellibones</em>,\nSusan Kelz Sperling cites three such words: <em>blore</em> (like a\nsheep), <em>crunkle</em> (like a crane), and <em>winx</em> (like a donkey).</p>\n<p>There are several general observations that can be\nmade about these terms. First of all, the great majority are\none-syllable words and almost all derive from Old or Middle\nEnglish or are, in origin, what lexicographers term “imitative,”\nthat is, onomatopoeic. Secondly, the simple noun\nform is identical with the verbal infinitive. These factors set\nthem very far apart from their Latin-derived associates,\nwhich are uniformly multisyllabic and which have differing\nnoun and verb forms, for example: <em>latrate</em> (like a dog) and\n<em>latration; stridulate</em> (like a cricket or grasshopper) and\n<em>stridulation</em>; and <em>ululate</em> (like a dog, jackal, wolf, or owl)\nand <em>ululation</em>.</p>\n<p>As already noted, many of the terms cited are imitative,\nor onomatopoeic, in origin. Onomatopoeia can be defined\nas “the formation of a word, as <em>cuckoo</em> or <em>boom</em>, by\nimitation of a sound made by or associated with its\nreferent”; and since a particular kind of animal makes the\nsame sound wherever it may be, an onomatopoeic rendition\nof that sound should, logically, be the same everywhere.\nThat is not the case, however. Onomatopoeia is very much\nethnocentric or, if you prefer, linguicentric, and what is\nonomatopoeic for the speaker of one language is not necessarily\nso for the speaker of another. What is <em>bow-wow</em> in\nEnglish, for example, is <em>oua oua</em> in French, <em>Wauwau</em> in\nGerman, <em>vau vau</em> in Hungarian, <em>bau bau</em> in Italian, <em>wan\nwan</em> in Japanese, <em>mong-mong</em> in Korean, <em>vovvov</em> in Norwegian\nand <em>hav hav</em> in Turkish.</p>\n<p>At the same time, onomatopoeic ethnocentricity must\nnot be over-emphasized, for the similarities in some cases\ncan be as striking as the differences in others. In other\nwords, there are some sounds which register very similarly\non ears around the world. The sounds represented in English\nby <em>cock-a-doodle-doo</em> and <em>meow</em> are good examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Croatian  —    <em>kukuriku</em>    —    <em>mijau</em><br>\nDutch    —     <em>kukeleku</em>     —   <em>miauw</em><br>\nFrench     —   <em>cocorico</em>     —   <em>miau</em><br>\nGerman      —  <em>das Kikeriku</em> —   <em>das Miau</em><br>\nHungarian  —   <em>kukurikú</em> — <em>nyavogas</em><br>\nIndonesian —   <em>kukurukuk</em>   —    <em>ngéong</em><br>\nItalian   —    <em>chicchirichi</em> —   <em>miagolio</em><br>\nJapanese  —    <em>kokko-kooko</em> —    <em>nyaw</em><br>\nKorean    —    <em>kkokyo</em>     —     <em>meow</em><br>\nNorwegian  —   <em>kykeliky</em>   —     <em>mjaue</em><br>\nPolish    —    <em>kukuryku</em>    —    <em>miau</em><br>\nPortuguese —   <em>cocorocó</em> — <em>miado</em><br>\nRomanian   —   <em>cutcurigu</em>   —    <em>mieunat</em><br>\nSwedish   —    <em>kuckeliku</em>   —    <em>jama</em><br>\nThai     —     <em>aek-ei-ek-ek</em> —   <em>miew</em><br>\nTurkish   —    <em>kokoriko</em>   —     <em>miyav</em><br>\nVietnamese —   <em>cuc-cu-cu</em>   —    <em>meo meo</em></p>\n</blockquote>",
