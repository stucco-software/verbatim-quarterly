Verlan is used every day in French, unlike pig Latin in America. Many words have become so common in Verlan that their French equivalents have fallen by the wayside. Some words have even been “re-verlanned.”</p>\n<p>To “verlan” a word is simple. First, separate it into syllables, then reverse the syllables. With a few minor spelling alterations, your word has successfully been “verlanned.” The spelling alterations can be quite complicated, though, as they have no set rules. Repeated letters are often dropped, while others are added for ease of pronunciation. Not every word can be verlanned, and most words that can be verlanned already have been.</p>\n<p>For example, let's consider the word <em>verlan</em>, which in itself is a verlanned word. The original French word, meaning to reverse, was <em>l'envers</em>. Now, separate it into its syllables, <em>l'en</em> and <em>vers</em>; reverse into <em>versl'en</em>; and adjust the spelling to <em>verlan</em>.</p>\n<p>Here is a diagram if you couldn't follow that:</p>\n<p><em>L'en vers</em> &gt; <em>versl'en</em> &gt; <em>verslen</em> &gt; <em>verslan</em> &gt; <em>verlan</em></p>\n<p>Single-syllable words, which obviously cannot be separated into syllables, are simply reversed. For example, <em>bus</em> becomes <em>sub</em>.</p>\n<p>Here is a brief list of French words that are commonly verlanned. As you will notice on the list, most of the words that have been verlanned are commonly used by children, but many adults use verlan words without even realizing it.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>French</th>\n<th>Verlan</th>\n<th>English</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>bande</td>\n<td>deban</td>\n<td>group</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bizarre</td>\n<td>zarbi</td>\n<td>weird</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black (Eng.)</td>\n<td>kebla</td>\n<td>black person</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bloqué</td>\n<td>kéblo</td>\n<td>blocked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bonjour</td>\n<td>jourbon</td>\n<td>hello</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bus</td>\n<td>sub</td>\n<td>bus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cablé</td>\n<td>bléca</td>\n<td>trendy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>café</td>\n<td>féca</td>\n<td>café</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>classe</td>\n<td>secla</td>\n<td>class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>clope</td>\n<td>peclot</td>\n<td>cigarette</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cool (Eng.)</td>\n<td>looc</td>\n<td>cool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>démon</td>\n<td>mondé</td>\n<td>demon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>disque</td>\n<td>skeud</td>\n<td>album</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>fais chier</td>\n<td>fais iéche</td>\n<td>it's boring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>femme</td>\n<td>meuf</td>\n<td>woman</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>flic</td>\n<td>keuf</td>\n<td>cop</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>fou</td>\n<td>ouf</td>\n<td>crazy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>français</td>\n<td>céfran</td>\n<td>French</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>jobard</td>\n<td>barjot</td>\n<td>crazy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>laisse tomber</td>\n<td>laisse béton</td>\n<td>drop it</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>l'envers</td>\n<td>verlan</td>\n<td>reverse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>louche</td>\n<td>chelou</td>\n<td>shady</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>mec</td>\n<td>keum</td>\n<td>man</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>mére</td>\n<td>reum</td>\n<td>mother</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>métro</td>\n<td>tromé</td>\n<td>train</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>musique</td>\n<td>sicmu</td>\n<td>music</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pére</td>\n<td>reup</td>\n<td>father</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>piscine</td>\n<td>cinepi</td>\n<td>pool (swimming)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>poulet</td>\n<td>lépou</td>\n<td>pig (slang for police officer)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pourri</td>\n<td>ripou</td>\n<td>corrupt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rap</td>\n<td>pera</td>\n<td>rap (music)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>truc</td>\n<td>keutru</td>\n<td>stuff</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>vas-y</td>\n<td>zvva</td>\n<td>go for it</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
