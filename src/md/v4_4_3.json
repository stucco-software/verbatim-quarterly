Neologisms are always\ncurrent among young people, as one manifestation of the\nrevolt that is necessary if the young are to accede to their\nculture's dominant positions.  With equal universality the\nelders resist being deposed, and one manifestation of this\nresistance is their anguished cry that their language is being\npolluted, degraded, bastardized.  The elders of my generation\nhave come up with a metaphor of their own to express the\nterrible danger they see: “The English language is an endangered\nspecies!”</p>\n<p>A typical example of this attitude appeared in “Curmudgeon-at-Large,”\nCleveland Amory's regular column in <em>Saturday\nReview</em> (2 Oct. 1976, p. 51), although Mr. Amory was more\nrestrained and more humorous than many writers on the\nsame subject.  “Young people nowadays,” we are told, “intend\nto go through life using only five expressions,” which are\n“ 'Right on,' 'With it,' 'Far out,' 'Get it all together,' and 'Let\nit all hang out.' ”  He then goes on to say that he has conducted\na small poll and concludes that to these young persons\n“ 'Right on' means 'With it,' 'With it' means 'Far out,' 'Far\nout' means 'Get it all together,' and 'Get it all together' means\n'Let it all hang out.' ”  There is no doubt that some young\nfolk don't always express themselves very clearly to us elders,\nbut even a confessed curmudgeon might find some surprisingly\npleasant affinities with his youthful informants if he would\nlisten to how they really use their terms.  He might even realize\nthat they are working under the same traditions that shaped\nthe “standard” language, and that he and they—and their\ncommon remote ancestors—are pretty much the same sorts\nof people.</p>\n<p><em>Right on</em> is most often heard as an exclamation of hearty\nagreement, used as a Member of Parliament would use “Hear!\nHear!”  The same metaphor, using a precise spatial location\nto represent verbal accuracy, is found in older expressions,\nsuch as “Very much to the point!”  or even “You've hit the\nnail right on the head!”  A statement that is <em>right on</em> in a clever\nway is officially known as an <em>epigram</em> from Greek -<em>gram</em>\n'writing' plus <em>epi</em>- 'on.'  (Please, may I say “write on?”)</p>\n<p><em>With it</em> has several meanings and is by no means new.  I\nheard it in the 1930s when working for a carnival; a person\nwho was <em>with it</em> was a fellow-carny, a <em>compeer</em>—which comes\nfrom an earlier word for with—Latin <em>com</em> 'with' plus <em>par</em>\n'equal.'  The 'with' roots are widely used in a figurative way,\nas in <em>sympathize</em> ('suffer with') and <em>compatible</em> ('endure with').\nThe most usual use of <em>with it</em> is in application to a person\nwho is deeply immersed in some activity, and an expert in\nit; our ancestors had a very similar metaphor in mind when\nthey coined the word <em>accomplished</em>—'filled with.'</p>\n<p><em>Far out</em>, like <em>right on</em>, often occurs as an exclamation\nof approval and could be replaced by any number of standard\nwords with the same idea of being “outside” of ordinary experience.\n<em>Extraordinary</em> can be analyzed as 'beyond that\nwhich is ordinary'; the roots of <em>exceptional</em> mean 'taken out,'\nand <em>exquisite</em> comes from 'seek out.'  <em>Superior</em> and <em>superb</em>\nalso denote something that is far out, this time in an upward\ndirection, while <em>delightful</em> uses not 'out' but the similar 'away,'\nand means 'enticed away.'</p>\n<p>To <em>get it all together</em> is to attain a state of composure,\nand <em>composure</em> is from French words having the sense of\n'put together.'  The person who has <em>got it all together</em> is <em>collected</em>\n('gathered together'), and not <em>distraught</em> ('pulled apart').\nThis term more often refers to someone who is operating at\npeak efficiency—that is, who is <em>coordinated</em> ('arranged together')\nand <em>competent</em> ('together in seeking').  When applied\nto the head—“I've got to get my head together”—the expression\nindicates a desirable state of mental <em>integrity</em> ('entireness')\nand <em>health</em> (from a Germanic root meaning 'wholeness').\nAll these carry the same implication of 'being together' in one\npiece—the opposite of unhealthy <em>schizophrenia</em>, or 'split mind.'</p>\n<p>Someone with a real mental problem is said to be <em>off\nhis rocker</em>, which is not very different from the literal meaning\nof <em>delirium</em>—'out of the furrow.'</p>\n<p><em>Let it all hang out</em> is an admonishment to be natural,\n<em>uninhibited</em>—which itself means 'not held in.'  <em>Unconstrained</em>\n('not bound together') and <em>unconfined</em> ('not imprisoned') are\nin the same family of metaphors.  To <em>let it all hang out</em> can\nalso mean to be forthright, to be <em>explicit</em>—'folded out.'  This\nusage also implies honesty—a word having the same meaning\nin Latin and said to have been derived from the name of a\nplant whose transparent seed-pods disclosed the seeds within.</p>\n<p>There are many other interesting words in the bright\nlexicon of youth.  One is the adjective <em>cool</em> as applied to someone\ndisplaying <em>sang-froid</em> ('cool blood,' of course) or <em>non-chalance</em>,\nwhich is literally 'not hot'—in other words, <em>cool</em>!</p>\n<p>At the other end of the temperature scale, young people\nare likely to feel <em>burned up</em> where one of their elders would\nbe <em>incensed</em>, from Latin <em>incendere</em>, 'to set on fire.'  Another\nword relating to fire can signify delight, as in the phrase\n“That just stokes me out of my gourd!”  Without using slang,\nthis could be rephrased as “That kindles in me a feeling of\necstasy!”  <em>Kindles</em> is obviously related to <em>stokes</em>, while <em>ecstasy</em>\n('standing outside of myself') is not very different from the\nrest of the phrase.  The word <em>gourd</em> is a synecdochic use of a\nmetaphor for the human head, which has cognates in a good\nmany languages.  Early Latin had the word <em>testa</em> 'a jug' which\nbecame a Roman slang word for 'the head' and eventually\nthe standard word for the organ in several Romance tongues.\nThe German <em>kopf</em> probably arose in the same way.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a new term is created to replace an old one\nwhose literal meaning is implied too faintly.  <em>Goodbye</em> has\nbecome an automatic expression indicating the end of a human\ncontact, and can be used peremptorily or angrily, its original\nderivation from 'God be with you' completely forgotten.  Many\nyoung people have therefore discarded it, preferring <em>have a\nnice day</em> as possessing a conscious context of well-wishing.\nAnd even the not-so-young may be heard to say <em>bye-bye</em>,\nwhich no modification of tone or emphasis can render unfriendly.</p>\n<p>One sad thing about the language of youth is the rapidity\nwith which a good expression becomes obsolete.  At one time\nthe Haight-Ashbury population used <em>to run with</em> 'to understand\nand agree' to be <em>au courant</em> ('running with') with someone.\nI think it a pity that so vivid a term is no longer used.\nDo you <em>concur</em>?  (Latin <em>con</em> 'with' plus <em>currere</em> 'run.')</p>",
