He wrote\nthe following, with the request that the master of ceremonies\nuse it without making any changes: “Ladies and Gentlemen, I\nbring you a man among men.  He is out of place when among\ncheaters and scoundrels.  He feels quite at home when surrounded\nby persons of integrity.  He is uncomfortable when not\nhelping others.  He is perfectly satisfied when his fellow human\nbeings are happy.  He tries to make changes in order for this\ncountry to be a better place.  He should leave us this evening\nwith feelings of disgust at ineptitude and a desire to do better.\nI present to you Mr. John Smith.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Smith or his secretary made a number\nof errors in punctuation, so that the master of ceremonies\nfound himself reading the following: “Ladies and Gentlemen, I\nbring you a man.  Among men, he is out of place.  When among\ncheaters and scoundrels, he feels quite at home.  When surrounded\nby persons of integrity, he is uncomfortable.

In order for\nthis country to be a better place, he should leave us this\nevening.

It is a reconstruction of\nsomething I read or heard as a high school student, several\ndecades ago.  I would appreciate information from readers of\n<em>Verbatim</em> concerning the identity of the story's originator, so\nthat I can duly credit him/her when the occasion next arises.</p>\n<p><em>[Lawrence Casler, 65 Woodland Road, Pittsford, New York 14534]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
