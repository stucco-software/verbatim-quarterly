It would\nseem that good control over clichés, especially, is\ncoordinate with a speaker's grasp of the idiom (in\nthe sense of 'spirit') of the language.</p>\n<p>A dictionary of clichés is an entirely different\nmatter.  I venture to say that there is hardly anything\nmore soporific than being given the meanings of expressions\nthat every native speaker knows quite intimately,\nfrom <em>do an about face</em> to <em>yours truly</em> (in this\nbook).  One could not compile such a book without\ngiving the meanings, but the interesting and useful\nmaterial here for the native speaker is what Christine\nAmmer has to say about their past and provenance.\nThus, we learn that <em>on the razor's edge</em> occurs\nin Homer and that <em>mad as a hatter</em>, which\nantedates Alice's teaparty, “is thought to come from\nthe fact that the chemicals used in making felt hats\ncould produce the symptoms of St. Vitus' dance or\nother nervous tremors.”  As one might expect, many\nclichés are simply metaphors, some of which are\ntransparent to us, others needing explanation.  Thus,\n<em>play ball with</em> seems obvious; but <em>mad as a hatter</em>,\nthough properly a simile, needs an explanation; <em>play\npossum</em> is meaningful only to those who have been\ntold what it means or have had direct experience\nwith the behavior of opossums.  There are quite a lot\nof opossums where I live (not, I hasten to say, of the\n<em>possum</em> type meriting the affectionate attention of\nDame Edna Everage), and one sees them most often\nafter they have been killed on the road by a car.  A\ncontemporary might thus be inclined to imbue them\nwith attributes that would give <em>play possum</em> a mysterious\nimport.  One might well wonder why some\nclichés have survived at all, considering their meaninglessness.\nThe etymological game being what it\nis—(<em>requiescat in</em>) <em>pace</em> John Ciardi—I fully expect\nsomeone to come up with an origin for <em>cute as a\nbutton</em> that identifies it with the six adorable daughters\nof some 17th-century Londoner named Button\nor, just to make it more complicated, a corruption of\nthe expression *<em>acute as a bouton</em> in which <em>bouton</em>\nmeans 'stud with a sharp point'—in other words,\noriginally equivalent to <em>sharp as a tack</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Have a Nice Day</em> contains useful information\nabout some 3000 such expressions, and we must be\ngrateful to Ms. Ammer for having come to grips\nwith a very difficult area of language.  My only criticism\nis that she often states that a given expression\n“first appeared” in a certain work, giving the citation.\nI cannot see how she can know that the expression\nwas not already a cliché at the time of its appearance\nin print.  In the case of <em>have a good day</em>,\nwhich riles many people, I submit that it is a revival,\nfor its equivalent must have been in the language\nmany years ago in order to have given rise to the\nshortened form (about which no one seems to get\nupset), <em>Good day</em>.  On which note I bid you all a good\nday.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
