Instead, we have twelve months,</p>\n<p>more or less equal, and September happens</p>\n<p>to have got thirty days. No problem. Oh,</p>\n<p>and there was one year when eleven went</p>\n<p>to make us equal with the continent.</p>\n<p>I before E except after C:</p>\n<p>we all agree this shall be true.</p>\n<p>The rebel words that do not spell</p>\n<p>that way are weird and few.</p>\n<p>Oh, and some French-descended words as well—</p>\n<p>leisure, seize, and such affairs—</p>\n<p>the problem's theirs.</p>\n<p>How small, of all that human hearts endure,</p>\n<p>That part which kings or laws can cause or cure,</p>\n<p>wrote Johnson. That, I think, sums up my feeling</p>\n<p>of why there'd be no mileage in repealing</p>\n<p>the law that says your age is fixed at birth,</p>\n<p>the one that bans cold liquids from congealing,</p>\n<p>the one that stipulates the height of ceiling</p>\n<p>for footpaths.  Would the benefits be worth</p>\n<p>all the upheavals that would send us reeling?</p>\n<p>The pen is mightier than the sword,</p>\n<p>which is why pens cost fifteen hundred pounds</p>\n<p>from licensed dealers, lessons in their use</p>\n<p>do not come cheap, and ownership is taxed</p>\n<p>at eighty pounds a year, while swords are freebies</p>\n<p>from charities and banks. Oh, and I worry</p>\n<p>when kids leave school functionally unfenced.</p>\n<p>Poetry is a verdict, not an occupation,</p>\n<p>said Leonard Cohen.  Tough, like science:</p>\n<p>not the law's unacknowledged legislation</p>\n<p>but its appliance.</p>\n<p>—<em>Adrian Baker</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
