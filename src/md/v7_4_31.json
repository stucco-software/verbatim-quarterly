Where else is it\nused?</p>\n<p><em>blink</em> a very thin coating of ice on a pond or the like.\nWe have one record from southeast Missouri.</p>\n<p><em>cheese cutter</em> <em>Dialect Notes</em> reported this in 1924 from\nNew Mexico for 'bicycle.' From Wisconsin in 1950\ncame the same word, but this time meaning 'Protestant.'\nThese must be independent developments, but\nthe second metaphor escapes us.</p>\n<p><em>chill</em> a very peculiar word: 'a new cane or shoot of\nthe salmonberry bush.' Reported from Washington\nstate. Where else is it known?</p>\n<p><em>Chinese school</em> a children's outdoor game reported\nfrom Massachusetts, Mississippi, and West Virginia.\nIs it played elsewhere? What are the rules in your\nneighborhood?</p>\n<p><em>chinker</em> from Connecticut we have one record of this\nfor 'rough, wild, or dangerous horse.' Other evidence\nof use, and explanation of source are needed.</p>\n<p><em>chipper</em> We have one report each for three different\nsenses: 'kiss' (Wisconsin), 'small child' (Ohio), and\n'doughnut' (Michigan). Do you know any of these?</p>\n<p><em>cho-cho</em> A small child, a boy. Two informants from\nOregon say it is a Basque word. Can others testify\nto its use, where and when. (Presumably it's from\nSpanish <em>muchacho</em>.)</p>\n<p><em>cold-bird</em> a 'brown bird (otherwise unidentified) whose\nsinging is thought to predict cold weather.' One\nreport from South Carolina, 1938. Is the term otherwise\nknown, and what bird is it?</p>\n<p><em>cold duck</em> not the drink, but a dance. Reported by\nBlacks from Virginia and West Virginia. How is it\ndone? Why the name?</p>\n<p><em>the same old six and seven</em> a reply to the question,\n“How are things?” Reported from Illinois and Oklahoma\nfrom past use. Where else was or is it used?\nWhat is its origin? (<em>At sixes and sevens</em> is standard;\nthis is different.)</p>",
