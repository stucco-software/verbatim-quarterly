Schur, Macmillan, 1974</p>\n<p>Norman Schur, Esquire, is an American attorney who\ndivides his time between England and America; I am an\nAmerican lexicographer who divides his time between\nEngland and America.  Norman Schur loves England and\nBriticisms; I love England and Briticisms.  Norman Schur\nhas compiled a dictionary of Briticisms; I have not compiled\nsuch a dictionary but have the advantage over Mr.\nSchur, for I am reviewing it.  On my passport, under\nOccupation, it says “Lexicographer.”</p>\n<p>First, let me say that this is a smashing book, strictly\nfirst rate; top-hole!  Though written in entertaining style,\nits amusement stems from the frequent incongruities inherent\nin the subject-matter and not from any supercilious\nflippancy on the part of the compiler.  This book should\nprove the definitive successor to all the silly articles that\noccasionally crop up in the Sunday supplements and in the\nairline magazines.  Schur is a serious compiler and his\ndefinitions are always to the point; where he deemed it\nappropriate, he added information that is sometimes cultural,\nsometimes etymological, sometimes laconically editorial,\nalways interesting.</p>\n<p>Thirty-odd pages of Introductory Notes provide essential\nguidelines not only to the use of the dictionary but\nto the differences between British and American English at\nthe semantic, phonetic, morphological, and cultural levels.\nI must admit that trying to do one's homework in a subject\nfor which adequate documentation is so sorely lacking is a\ndifficult task, and we must be grateful to Mr. Schur for\nhaving acted as researcher, compiler, and editor all in one.\nThere is a great deal of fascinating material here that anyone\ninterested in the (American/British) England language\nshould have at his fingertips.  Here are a few\nexamples:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ENGLISH</th>\n<th>AMERICAN</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>cooker</td>\n<td>stove</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Cooker is the normal English word for stove.  An Englishman\nwould hardly ever say electric stove, but gas stove\nis heard.  The generic term for this kitchen appliance in\nEngland is, however,<em>cooker</em>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ENGLISH</th>\n<th>AMERICAN</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>one-eyed village</td>\n<td>one-horse town</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Also known in American as a <em>whistle stop</em>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ENGLISH</th>\n<th>AMERICAN</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>turnabout</td>\n<td>reversible</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Applied to overcoats.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ENGLISH</th>\n<th>AMERICAN</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>waving base</td>\n<td>observation deck</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At an airport.  The English expression implies much livelier\nactivity than just looking.  At Scottish airports they call it by\nthe rather stuffy term spectator's terrace.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ENGLISH</th>\n<th>AMERICAN</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Wren, n. (col.)</td>\n<td>Wave</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A member of the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS).\nin praise of these patriotic ladies: “Up with the lark and to\nbed with the wren.”</p>\n<p>My questions are based on a close examination of A\nto D and some spot checking elsewhere, from E to (as\nthey say) Zed.  I think that Schur has included some entries\nthat are not exclusively Briticisms: <em>Balaclava</em> (helmet),\n<em>bandy-legged, bill</em> ('small machete'), <em>brimstone</em> ('sulfur'),\n<em>budgerigar, canterbury</em> ('magazine rack'), <em>clue</em> (in “I\nhaven't a clue”), <em>compositor</em> ('typesetter'), <em>coomb</em> or <em>cwm,\ncos</em> (kind of lettuce), <em>distemper</em> (painting with a size\nbase), <em>doyen, loofah, ring the changes, tantalus</em>.  On the\nother hand, I found entries, which I would consider common\nBriticisms, missing: <em>aerial</em> (Brits never say 'antenna'\nexcept for insects), <em>arse</em> (for 'ass' or 'bottom'), <em>back bacon</em>\n(something like Canadian bacon), <em>bottle</em> or <em>rigging screw</em>\n(for turn-buckle: I didn't want to get into nautical terminology,\nbut, since Schur has <em>bag</em> ...), <em>icing sugar</em> (for\nconfectioner's sugar), <em>coffee sugar, come a cropper, Demerara\nsugar, down printing, drone</em> (<em>spiv</em> is in), <em>duvet, film</em>\n('movie'),?  <em>five honours</em> (<em>four honours</em> is in), <em>moving stairway,\nmulti-storey, rooms</em> ('a surgeon's offices'), <em>singlet,\nstarter</em> ('appetizer'), <em>streaky</em> (the kind of bacon sold in the\nU.S.), <em>twit</em> ('a silly person; dumbbell'), <em>Uncle Tom Cobbleigh\nand all, zebra crossing</em> ('pedestrian crossing'), <em>pelican\ncrossing</em> (Pe (destrian) Li(ght) Con (trolled) Crossing),\nand <em>Belisha beacon</em>.</p>\n<p>Other matters: I think <em>accumulator</em> is reserved for\n'storage battery'; 'battery' is used for dry cells.  Why not\ngloss <em>as soon as say knife</em> as 'before you could say “Jack\nRobinson” '?  At <em>bags I!</em>, I am more familiar with 'Dibs\non...!' than with 'I dibsy!'  It would have been useful\nto comment that <em>balls</em>, although used colloquially, is not\nconsidered vulgar.</p>\n<p><em>Bangers</em> are called that everywhere they are eaten, not\njust at agricultural shows.</p>\n<p>The comment about <em>BBC English</em> is no longer true since\nthe BBC started employing people who don't necessarily\nspeak RP.</p>\n<p>Under <em>beat up</em>, it would be less far-fetched to recall the\nbeaters who flush grouse, pheasant, partridge, quail, and\nother game birds than the Africans who rouse beasts for\nwhite hunters.  My informants know <em>beat up</em> only in the\nsense of 'give a thrashing to,' and are more likely to use\n<em>knock up</em> in this sense.</p>\n<p><em>Beggar</em>, I think, is a euphemism for 'bugger.'</p>\n<p>The description at <em>biscuit</em> is a noble effort, but the matter\nmay never be straightened out!  Jacobs, an English company,\nmarkets “Cream Crackers” that are neither firecrackers\nnor explosive bonbons.  Sorry, no suggestions from\nthis quarter.</p>\n<p>A <em>broadsheet</em> is also called a 'broadside' in America--\npicturesque, eh?</p>\n<p><em>Browned off</em> needs a usage label.</p>\n<p><em>B.S.T.</em> stands for <em>British Summer</em> (not Standard) Time;\n<em>G.M.T.</em> is not in.  It's very confusing since the U.S. went on\nDaylight Saving for two years starting last November.</p>\n<p>At <em>bugger off</em> (and elsewhere, e.g., <em>take your finger out</em>,\nfor which I have a citation for its public use by Prince\nPhilip), I cannot agree with Schur's “delicacy”--or should\nI be blaming his editor at Macmillan?</p>\n<p>The definition of <em>bump-start</em> is fine, but I use <em>jump-start</em>,\ngiven as the American equivalent, to mean a start using\njumper cables from another car's battery to start a car\nwhose battery is dead.  As a Briticism, <em>jump-start</em> means to\nget an engine started by engaging the clutch while the car\nis rolling after a push.</p>\n<p>'Give a hoot' might have been a more felicitous equivalent\nfor <em>care a ninepin</em> than 'give a damn,' which is\nstronger.</p>\n<p><em>Carry on</em> is well handled as it is, but its use in the context\nof 'You, first,' when offering to hold a door for someone,\nis missing, and 'keep going,' fine for other contexts,\ndoesn't quite cover it.</p>\n<p>A <em>chesterfield</em> isn't just any kind of sofa.</p>\n<p>A <em>cinema</em> is a 'movie house,' not 'movies.'  A movie is\nusually called a film (not in).</p>\n<p>At <em>cock</em>, something might have been said about Americans'\nmincing, wincing use of the word.  Englishmen\nmocking this squeamishness have been heard to refer to\n'roostertails' for preprandial spirits, 'pet roosters' for petcocks.</p>\n<p>A <em>conker</em> is a horse chestnut, whence <em>conkers</em>, the children's\ngame.</p>\n<p><em>Get your knickers in a twist</em> means to 'make a muddle of\nbecause of utter confusion,' not to 'make a great fuss.'</p>\n<p>And <em>nick</em>, in addition to the sense given, means to 'steal'\nand to 'arrest.'</p>\n<p>All that would seem either to detract from the praise\ngiven Mr. Schur's book earlier in this review or, if mitigated,\nto leave you with the notion that, despite our criticism,\nwe like it because it's the only game in town.  But I\nhave two replies to that: first, I confess to having indulged\nin the usual game of carping at dictionaries; second, because\nthe matters I have found to comment on here occupy\na few lines, while Mr. Schur's book occupies almost 500\npages.  In short, it contains a huge amount of extremely\nvaluable information on a subject that is too often treated\nfrivolously and facetiously by writers who know far less\nabout language than does Mr. Schur.</p>\n<p>I, for one, welcome him to the depleted ranks of lexicographers.\nI welcome his book as an important work of\nscholarship and integrity.</p>",
