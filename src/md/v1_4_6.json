What apparently\noperates in this phenomenon of language is that speakers\nhear a form that vaguely reminds them of something\nsimilar, to which they refer it.

The <em>crayfish</em> isn't a <em>fish</em>, a <em>mushroom</em> has neither <em>mush</em>\nnor <em>room</em>, there is hope, rather than <em>despair</em> in <em>Cape\nd'espoir</em>, and a <em>ballbuster</em> just gets things done, like any\ngood manager.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
