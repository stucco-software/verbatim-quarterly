Fowkes</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">New York University</span></em></p>\n<p>Many linguists have, with or without a surgeon's license,\noperated in the past with the term <em>juncture</em>; at present such\nlinguists appear to have a dim future.  Nevertheless, whether\nthe name of the phenomenon makes any great sense or not, its\nexistence can hardly be denied.  In English it helps make possible\nthe distinction between</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>my keys</em> and <em>Mikey's</em><br>\n<em>John and Pete's mother</em> and <em>John and Pete smother</em><br>\n<em>the candlesticks</em> and <em>the candle sticks</em><br>\n<em>trumpet</em> and <em>trump it</em><br>\n<em>Riley</em> and <em>wrily</em><br>\n<em>giant size</em> and <em>giant's eyes</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and (the favorite stock-in-trade) <em>nitrate</em> and <em>night rate</em>.</p>\n<p>The actual phonetic nature of juncture can consist of several\nminor features.  In <em>night rate</em> the first <em>t</em> is clearly different\nfrom the first <em>t</em> in nitrate, for example.  In <em>Riley</em> and <em>wrily</em> the\nvowel sounds (actually diphthongs) of the first syllables are\ndifferent from each other.  There are also concomitant variations\nin pitch, in stress, in intonation, and perhaps in tension.\nVery old-fashioned linguists spoke of “open juncture” (<em>my</em> +\n<em>keys</em>) versus “close juncture” (<em>Mikey's</em>).  Professor C. F. Hockett\nused “sharp transition” and “muddy transition” for open and\nclose juncture respectively.</p>\n<p>The following examples come to mind, most of them actually\nhaving been heard, although one or two are the product\nof a wild imagination:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Michael row the boat ashore</em> (he will?)<br>\n<em>I'll leave 'n' say goodbye</em> (I'll even...)<br>\n<em>She's now in the low weighties</em>(low 80's)<br>\n<em>He's a relic of the dock cages</em> (Dark Ages)<br>\n<em>The arrival of a rival in the Middle Least</em><br>\n<em>The cost of futilities is too high these days</em><br>\n<em>Miss Steak of 1976</em> (the hypothetical local<br>\nqueen of the Butcher's Union answered to that title)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A neighbor of mine went to a performance of <em>The Omen\nof the God</em>.  Other disjunctured titles that come to mind are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Hawk'll Bury Finn</em><br>\n<em>Allover Twist</em><br>\n<em>Venue Come to the Andover Perfect Day</em><br>\n<em>Back an alien revelry</em> (Bacchanalian...)<br>\n<em>Bar dye</em> (barred <em>i</em>)<br>\n<em>Bone ash/Beau Nash/bow gnash</em><br>\nA lot of ice/a lotta vice<br>\nHe enjoyed a sport snooze during the sports news.<br>\n<em>Day is Dying in the West</em>.  (Dey is?)<br>\n<em>These speeches/peaches kill me</em>.<br>\nMy life's tory<br>\nMy life's pan<br>\nMy life's candle<br>\nAvoid Tudor wise<br>\n<em>How are you?  Dantesque!</em>  (Don't ask!)<br>\n<em>Don Q!  (You're welcome—a rum reply</em>.)<br>\n<em>The proposition that tall men are created equal</em>.<br>\n<em>The malicious militias on both sides</em>.<br>\n<em>Boilers re-cored</em>.  (and Beatles record?)<br>\n<em>On Brotherhood Day we welcome a brother hood</em>.<br>\n<em>A broad in America</em><br>\n<em>Monica Vauley Sir Veighs</em> (Monarch of all...)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Herb Oscar Anderson (on radio station WOR, New York\nCity) is called by his colleagues several times a day, “Her Bosker\nAnderson.”  Finally, one cannot resist imparting an unabashed\ntransglottal monstrosity overheard in Washington\nSquare Park: <em>Ombra your own foo!</em>—apparently as a reply to\nHandel's <em>Largo: Ombra mai fu</em>.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
