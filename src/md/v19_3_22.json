Among English-language monolingual dictionaries, the practice is widespread in America and reviving in Britain. A very recent development, of British origin, is the addition of names to monolingual dictionaries of English as a Second Language [ESL], such as the new “encyclopedic edition” of the <em>Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</em> (1992).</p>\n<p>Pronunciation dictionaries and bilingual dictionaries typically enter names, too. But the purpose of such entries is linguistic rather than encyclopedic: they are there to show how they are pronounced or how their form differs in different languages:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cicero... Cicerón. Mary... <em>˜Queen of Scots, ˜ Stuart</em> María Estuardo.</p>\n<p>—<em>Collins Spanish Dictionary</em> (1988)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now and then, however, even bilingual dictionaries enter names for their content rather than for their form. <em>Mondadori's Pocket Italian-English English-Italian Dictionary</em> (1959) attempts to introduce its Anglophone users to the glories of Italian civilization by entering the names of some of its avatars and describing their achievements in English:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cimabue,</em> Giovanni, early Florentine painter (1240?-1302?).</p>\n<p><em>Goldoni,</em> Carlo, the greatest Italian dramatist and writer of comedies (in Venetian dialect) (1707-1793).</p>\n<p><em>Mondadori,</em> Arnoldo, leading Italian publisher (1889- ).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This last array prompts the question: how are names chosen for inclusion?</p>\n<p>Other items (<em>cat, the, kick the bucket</em>) are sometimes selected from a corpus of language in use. Items that appear frequently in sources of different types are included; items less frequent or more restricted in their distribution are kept out. Not all dictionaries use such objective evidence. Many— perhaps most—still rely on the subjective judgment of the lexicographers who compile them, aided often by a judicious perusal of what other dictionaries include. Where names are concerned, I know of no dictionary in any language whose selection was made from a corpus: all rely on the assessment of lexicographers.</p>\n<p>Which names are deemed worthy of inclusion? Let me examine five dictionaries with names in them: <em>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</em> (1983) [W9] 1983; <em>Random House Webster's College Dictionary</em> (1991) [<em>RHWCD</em>]; <em>The American Heritage Dictionary,</em> 3rd edition (1992) [<em>AHD</em>3]; <em>Collins English Dictionary,</em> 3rd edition (1991) [<em>CED</em>3]; and, for good measure, an ancient <em>Nouveau Petit Larousse Illustré</em> (1958) [<em>PL</em>]. The first three are American; the fourth, British; the fifth, French. All five enter <em>Cicero/Cicéron, Cimabue, Goldoni,</em> and <em>Mary/Marie Stuart (Mary Queen of Scots)</em>, but not <em>Mondadori</em>. For a finer-grained investigation my starting-point will be the surname <em>Robinson,</em> where I find the following names:</p>\n<p>Robinson:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>Name</em></th>\n<th><em>W9</em></th>\n<th><em>RHWCD</em></th>\n<th><em>AHD3</em></th>\n<th><em>CED3</em></th>\n<th><em>PL</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Edward G. (US actor)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edward Arlington (US poet)</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Esmé Stuart Lennox (Fr Playwright)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>George Frederick Samuel (UK statesman)</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>William Heath (UK cartoonist)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jack Roosevelt (US baseball player)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>James Harvey (US historian)</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>John Arthur Thomas (UK theologian)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mary (Fr President)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Robert (UK chemist)</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smokey (US singer-songwriter)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sugar Ray (US Boxer)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Startlingly, of these 12 Robinsons no single one is enshrined in all five dictionaries! Of the 12, six are American; four, English; two, Irish. But as can be seen from the table above, only <em>W9</em> has, and only <em>CED3</em> approaches, parity between American and non-American Robinsons.</p>\n<p>So to check these dictionaries for national bias, I looked at a few minimal pairs: pairs of people who seemed to play similar roles on their respective sides of the Atlantic: suffragettes, birth-controllers, popular advocates of self-reliance, and engineers:</p>\n<p>Minimal Pairs:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>Name</em></th>\n<th><em>W9</em></th>\n<th><em>RHWCD</em></th>\n<th><em>AHD3</em></th>\n<th><em>CED3</em></th>\n<th><em>PL</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Anthony, Susan B.</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pankhurst, Emmiline (or Christabel or Sylvia) (E,C,S)</td>\n<td>Yes (E)</td>\n<td>Yes (E)</td>\n<td>Yes (E)</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sanger, Margaret</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stopes, Marie</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alger, Horatio</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smiles, Samuel</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fulton, Robert</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brunel, Mare Isambard (or Isambard Kingdom) (both) (both)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It is pretty clear that the British <em>CED3</em> takes more account of American names than do the American dictionaries of British ones. This is hardly surprising, as British dictionaries do a better job with American English generally than American dictionaries do with British English.</p>\n<p>But encyclopedic dictionaries (though not, perhaps, ESL ones) are supposed to include important names from all over the world. So to examine cultural bias in a wider sense, I checked the surname <em>Lambert,</em> happily borne by Anglophones as well as Francophones. Here is what I found:</p>\n<p>Lambert:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>Name</em></th>\n<th><em>W9</em></th>\n<th><em>RHWCD</em></th>\n<th><em>AHD3</em></th>\n<th><em>CED3</em></th>\n<th><em>PL</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Michel (ca. 1610-1696: French composer)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>John (1619-1683: English general)</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anne-Thérèse (1647-1733: French writer)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Johann Heinrich (1728-1777: German scientist)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Constant (1905-1951: English composer)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the French dictionary was weak on Robinsons, the British and American dictionaries are at least as weak on Lamberts. The pedagogical pretensions of encyclopedic dictionaries must be taken with a grain of salt, though their skewing may be a fair reflection of the limited knowledge that speech communities have of the worthies of whom other speech communities boast. And the German Lambert, though unworthy of a biographical entry of his own in the four Anglophone dictionaries, is remembered nevertheless in their etymologies of the scientific unit, the <em>lambert,</em> that bears his name.</p>\n<p>Having somehow selected the names to be included, lexicographers must set about explaining them. But how? The mere indication of the dates and places of birth and death will usually suffice to identify the bearer of a name uniquely; if one goes further, where does one stop? Dictionaries seem to divide into two camps. Some say the minimum, limiting themselves typically to “birth and death dates, nationality, and occupation or status” [<em>W9</em>]. Others attempt more, need more space, and run risks. Two examples will show the problems:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cornwallis, Charles</em></p>\n<p>...1738-1805... Brit. general and statesman. [<em>W9</em>]</p>\n<p>...1738-1805. British general and statesman. [<em>RHWCD</em>]</p>\n<p>...1738-1805. British military and political leader who commanded forces in North Carolina during the American Revolution. His surrender at Yorktown in 1781 marked the final British defeat. [<em>AHD3</em>]</p>\n<p>...1738-1805, British general in the War of American Independence: commanded forces defeated at Yorktown (1781): defeated Tipu Sahib (1791): governor general of India (1786-93, 1805): negotiated the Treaty of Amiens (1801). [<em>CED3</em>]</p>\n<p>..., général anglais, né à Londres (1738-1805). Il capitula à Yorktown pendant la guerre d'Amérique (1781), soumit Tippo-Sahib (1792); vice-roi d'Irlande, il réprima la rébellion de 1798. [<em>PL</em>]</p>\n<p>..., English general, born London (1738-1805). He surrendered at Yorktown during the American War of Independence (1781), subdued Tipu Sultan (1792); as viceroy of Ireland, he suppressed the rebellion of 1798.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To Americans, Cornwallis was History (i.e., irrelevant) after Yorktown. Not so to the British, Indians, Irish, and French; though it is no less interesting to not the different emphases of the British <em>CED</em> (Treaty of Amiens—a truce in the Napoleonic wars—but no Ireland) and the French <em>PL</em> (Ireland and the bloodily suppressed 'rébellion de 1798' but no Amiens).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Britten, Benjamin</em></p>\n<p>...1913-1976... Eng. composer. [<em>W9</em>]</p>\n<p>...1913-76, English composer and pianist. [<em>RHWCD</em>]</p>\n<p>... 1913-1976. British composer known for his song cycles, such as <em>Les Illuminations</em> (1939), and operas, including <em>Peter Grimes</em> (1945) and <em>Death in Venice</em> (1973). [<em>AHD3</em>]</p>\n<p>...1913-76, English composer, pianist, and conductor. His works include the operas <em>Peter Grimes</em> (1945) and <em>Billy Budd</em> (1951), the choral works <em>Hymn to St Cecilia</em> (1942) and <em>A War Requiem</em> (1962), and numerous orchestral pieces. [<em>CED3</em>]</p>\n<p>[no entry in <em>PL</em>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What was Britten's “occupation or status”? Composer only? Composer and pianist? Composer, pianist, and conductor? What, indeed, was his “nationality”: “English” or “British”? (Cornwallis is unequivocally “British” to everyone but the French.) And which of Britten's many works deserve mention—besides <em>Peter Grimes</em>? I suspect that what Britten is “known for” most of all is <em>A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra;</em> but perhaps music for children does not count for much in dictionaries for grown-ups.</p>\n<p>With ordinary words and phrases in dictionaries, the criteria for including them and the criteria for explaining them are independent in principle. <em>Cat</em> gets in because of the frequency and range of its occurrences (determined objectively or subjectively). What the dictionary says about <em>cat</em> has then to be decided.</p>\n<p>With names in dictionaries, the criteria for inclusion and the criteria for explanation are inextricably interdependent. <em>Britten, Cornwallis,</em> and all the rest get in not because of their abundant presence in texts, but because lexicographers feel that the bearers of these names are important folk. And the explanations the lexicographers proceed to provide for the names are explicit attempts to justify their inclusion. What is thus characteristic of such encyclopedic entries is true of all the entries in encyclopedias. In other words, an encyclopedia is an enormous exercise in self-justification.</p>",
