It has been in consistent\npopular use in speech since the early 1950s, and it is now\nknown to nearly every student we have spoken with from all\nover the United States, all of whom use it in the same way, as\nan adjective meaning larger than life, awesome, overwhelming,\nenormous.  It is more vivid and forceful than the conventional\nsynonyms like <em>tremendous or huge</em>.  Students asked to\noffer “etymologies” for it say it probably is composed of <em>huge</em>\nand <em>monstrous</em>—in other words, it is like <em>chortle or galumph</em>,\nLewis Carroll “portmanteaus.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting question about the word is\nhow it has spread so far and so fast without appearing, so far\nas we know, very often in print.  It seems to be known all over\nthe country, judging from students in classes at Washington\nUniversity, St. Louis, who come from such exotic places as\nPhiladelphia, California, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Chicago,\nand St. Louis.  And the oldest known persons who claim to\nhave used it in their high school days are in their middle 30s,\nsuggesting that it originated, perhaps, in the early 1950s.\n(These persons, Elbert and Marion Hill, now living in Southeast\nOklahoma, were met by one of the present authors—\nRevard—during a trip to Las Vegas.  Discovering that they\nknew the word in their youth was some compensation for his\nhaving lost the humongous sum of forty cents in the slot\nmachines.)</p>\n<p>As it happens, however, we have now found <em>humongous</em>\nin print.  Olive, being a pilot, occasionally reads <em>Flying</em>\nmagazine; he turned up the following sentence in its June\n1975 issue, in an article by Richard L. Collins entitled “Pilot\nReport: 112A” (p. 48, col. 2, line 10):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The metal doors were incorporated on existing\nairplanes, at no cost to the customer but at <em>humongous</em>\ncost to Rockwell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The italics, of course, are added.  It is clear that Collins meant\nhis <em>humongous</em> to convey just what the students' use of it does;\nwe may be certain that Rockwell shelled out tremendous\nsums to get that door incorporated!</p>\n<p>Another sighting of <em>humongous</em>, albeit slightly misspelled,\nin <em>People Magazine</em>, December 5, 1977, on page 118, center\ncolumn, next to the last line: “...smirking, humunguous\ngiant clams.”  We should at least be able to settle on a spelling.</p>\n<p>Can any readers of VERBATIM offer earlier examples of\nthis word in print or in speech?  Does anyone know whether\nthe word began in the slang or argot of a particular group, or\nin a particular region?  Does anyone have a good idea of how\nit has spread and flourished so remarkably?  (We suspect disc\njockeys; perhaps it is on TV now, but no one among those we\nhave talked to seems to have noticed it there.  Is it abroad yet\nin England?</p>\n<p>ADDENDUM: In most U.S. cities, there now are policemen\nor announcers providing traffic reports on certain radio stations\nfrom helicopters patrolling over the main streets and\nthroughways.  In St. Louis, one such policeman has invented\n(apparently) a term for the traffic-jam caused by drivers\nslowing down to gawk at an accident or incident: <em>gaper-block</em>.\nIs this term in use anywhere else?  If the policeman\n(Don Miller) did not get it elsewhere, it will be interesting to\nsee whether it spreads.  It may well be that the term <em>trafficjam</em>\nbegan in a particular city, invented by a particular person.\nBut most words or idioms, though presumably beginning\nwith individuals, seem never to be traceable; no one has ever\nbeen able to catch a turn of speech at its source, though\neveryone seems to pick up such turns quickly and it is always\nappreciated as a humorous way of filling a newly felt need in\nthe language.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
