It is not only an in-depth study of\nthe eccentric idiom (linguistic freak?) known as Cockney\nrhyming slang, but, much more than that, an illuminating\ntreatment of the social background of those who speak that\nidiom, the working-class society which inhabits the East End of\nLondon.  Cockney is not only a patois, but, say the authors, “an\nattitude of mind.”  Rhyming slang is only an incidental.  A\nglance at the index of any respectable library will reveal the\nmultiplicity of books about Cockney rhyming slang.  In most\ncases, the subject is given light-hearted treatment, as though\nthis jargon were little more than food for variety turns (i.e.,\nvaudeville acts).  This is the only book I have seen that goes\nbeyond the usually over-romanticized and too often parodied\nidiom, to explore its social background.</p>\n<p>To define some terms: <em>muvver</em> is Cockney for <em>mother</em> (just\nas <em>bovver</em>, for instance, is Cockney for <em>bother</em>, and so on).  The\n<em>v</em> sound for <em>th</em> as in <em>mother</em> and the <em>f</em> sound for <em>th</em> as in <em>thing</em>\nare among the Cockney variations.  (After all, the Germans\npronounce their <em>v</em> as our <em>f</em> and their <em>w</em> as our <em>v</em>, and the French\ndon't bother to pronounce a great many of their letters of the\nalphabet at all, so what's so funny about <em>v</em> or <em>f</em> for <em>th</em>?)</p>\n<p>Next: rhyming slang.  This consists of a large number of\ntwo- or three-word concoctions, the last word of which rhymes\nwith the word intended to be conveyed.  Thus: <em>boat race 'face';\ndaisy roots 'boots'; German bands 'hands'; loaf of bread 'head';\nmince pies 'eyes'; plates of meat 'feet'; tit for tat 'hat'; trouble\nand strife 'wife.'</em> But—and this is a very big but—to confuse the\nissue, the rhyming word is almost invariably <em>omitted</em>, so that\nwe wind up with <em>daisies</em> for <em>boots, Germans for hands, loaf</em>\n'head,' <em>minces</em> 'eyes', <em>plates</em> 'feet', <em>titfer (tit for)</em> 'hat'; the list\ngoes on and on and on.  For an exhaustive compilation, see <em>A\nLoad of Cockney Cobblers</em>, by Bob Alwin (Johnston &amp; Bacon\nPublishers, London, 1971).  As a passing note, did you know\nthat the origin of <em>raspberry</em> for a derisive sound was Cockney\n<em>raspberry tart?  Brewer</em> says: “ 'Raspberry' is <em>heart</em>, contracted\nfrom 'raspberry-tart,' ” so <em>raspberry tart</em> apparently served\nmore than one purpose.</p>\n<p><em>The Muvver Tongue</em>, in scholarly depth and with affection,\nexplores many aspects of Cockney life: the family, manners\nand moods, the proprieties, money matters, hospitality, vulgarity.\nAs only one example of the social approach, the authors\npoint out toilet humor and imagery as a recognizable aspect of\nCockney talk, not because Cockneys are innately coarse, but\nbecause their living conditions have put the subject “under\ntheir noses,” literally as well as figuratively.</p>\n<p>The authors are products of the Cockney homeland of\nEast London, and the book is full of fun, vulgarity, and pride\nof that part of the world.  In writing about its language, which\nis their own, they destroy myths and misconceptions about\nCockney rhyming slang and demonstrate that it is not “bad\nEnglish,” but the idiom of a special working-class culture with\nroots that go back more than 150 years.  It is a credit to the\nauthors, now in their sixties, that working-class bias is never\nallowed to get in the way of scholarly, objective treatment,\nwhich provides much of interest to the layman and invaluable\ninformation for the specialist.</p>\n<p>Norman W.
