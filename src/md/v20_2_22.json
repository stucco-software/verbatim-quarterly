Mr. Wagner writes, “There is no authentic <em>dialect</em> in the ex-British Caribbean, not even in the pejorative corruption of a parent tongue (as in Pennsylvania Dutch, for instance).” Oh, Mr. Wagner, you have hurt me to the quick! Pennsylvania Dutchman that I am, I must hasten to point out that <em>Pennsyfawnisch Deitsch</em> is not a corruption, let alone a pejorative one, of its parent tongue. Even though some elements are borrowed from other languages, it is, nevertheless, an authentic dialect of German derived from the dialects spoken by the original Pennsylvania Dutch settlers from the RhinePalatinate and Baden-Württemberg in the 18th century. During WWII, German prisoners of war who were assigned to work on farms in south central Pennsylvania were able to communicate well with anyone who spoke Pennsylvania Dutch. Those in Germany today who speak the Swabian dialect can recognize kindred spirits in their Pennsylvania-Dutch-speaking brethren. Even people in Thuringia and Saxony to whom I have spoken my very limited “Dutch” were able to identify it as a German dialect and to understand it. Please, Mr. Wagner, we Pennsylvania Dutch are also part of that rearguard action against, as you so felicitously put it, those who are “busy ironing out indigenous language rhythms in the interests of the 'global village.”'</p>\n<p>[Roy B.
