In fact, it is our great desire for\na long time to send him overseas for a good mission and\nachievement, which will benefit the world and this great\ncountry of Nigeria.  Indeed time failed to facilitate us with\nthe opportunity to accomplish this intention.

I also stress that\nGod has made it possible through your hand, and we trust\nyou will receive a blessing.  Today, considering the great\ndegree of modesty you and your wife have taken E— as a\nson, may he be able to win a name in the vast world, and\nalso help his people in due course of time.</p>\n<p>Without minding all the trouble you are helping the\npoor.  Once again I immensely thank you and your wife.  Actually\nwords fail me to greet you all.  I know God will reward\nyou His best.  I shall always remember you in my\nprayers.  Then, your kindness is quite appreciated and welcomed\nhere by my people and all lovers of the progress of\nyouth.  In view of your help to E—, it is understood that\npeople in California are nice people.  Of course there is no\ndoubt of this, hence seeing is believing.  High above all, it is\nleft to you now, as E's father there, to develop, train and\nbring him up to be very useful to the world and Nigeria in\nparticular.  Whatever you feel best about him, please render\nit to him.</p>\n<p>J—is a township in the Northern Region of Nigeria.  It\nis in the Plateau Province.  It is one of the best townships in\nthis country.  It is a cold place.  You may be interested to\nknow that for the past three months, J— has been as miserable\nas it seems the summer in England has been.  Local\nopinion is that not for many years has it been so cold and\nwet as this year.  However, October so far promises some\nsunshine.</p>\n<p>Accept my sincere compliments for the season.
