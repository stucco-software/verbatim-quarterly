It is seldom indeed that I come across\nany English-language writer who cites linguistic examples\ntaken from Turkish, which seems to be largely an unknown\nlanguage except in certain academic circles.  I think that a few\ncomments on his Turkish examples are not inappropriate and\nmight be of some interest to VERBATIM readers.</p>\n<p>His first example is <em>kizilbas</em>, which he defines as 'red\nwoman.'  That could conceivably be a valid definition, albeit\na rather forced one.  <em>Kizilbas</em> (lit: 'red head') is a term\noriginally used for a member of a certain Shiite dervish sect or\na member of a specific military class in the army of Shah\nIsmail (d. 1524) of Persia.  In both cases, the term was purely\ndescriptive and derived from the red turbans worn by the\npeople concerned.  Because of the dissolute habits of the\n<em>Kizilbaslar</em>, the term eventually became applicable to any\nperson of loose moral habits, male or female.  Thus, by no\nstretch of the imagination can the use of <em>kizil</em> in <em>kizilbas</em> be\nconstrued to mean that <em>kizil</em> has any inherent meaning of\namorousness in Turkish, as Eisiminger asserts.  This is not to\nsay that <em>kizil</em> does not have non-color connotations.  To cite\nonly two examples: <em>kizil deli</em> (lit: <em>red madman</em>), meaning\n'raving maniac,' and <em>kizil kiyamet</em> (lit: 'red uproar'), meaning\n'fearful uproar' or 'terrible tumult.'</p>\n<p>Eisiminger's second example is <em>saricizmeli</em>, which he\ndefines as 'yellow.'  Actually it means 'yellow-booted' or\n'someone wearing yellow boots.'  The word is encountered,\nalmost without excepton, in the phrase <em>saricizmeli Mehmed\nAĝa</em> (lit: 'yellow-booted Mehmed Agha').  [<em>Mehmed Agha</em>\nused to be the Turkish equivalent of the British <em>Tommy\nAtkins</em> and the American <em>G.I. Joe</em>.]  In Turkish it is used as a\nterm of derision applied to an utterly unknown character or,\nas Eisiminger puts it, a 'nobody.'</p>\n<p>Eisiminger's third example is <em>yeşillenmek</em>, which he\ndefines as 'to be green.'  Actually it means 'to become green';\n'to be green' is <em>yeşil olmak</em>.  He correctly gives its extended\nmeaning as 'to be sexually aroused.'</p>\n<p>Eisiminger comments in his article that in most languages\n<em>white</em> generally has positive connotations and <em>black</em>\nnegative ones.  This is true also in Turkish.  For example, <em>yüz\naki</em> (lit: 'white of face') and <em>yüz karasi</em> (lit: 'black of face')\nmean, respectively, 'honor' and 'dishonor.'  The terms can\nalso be used adjectively: <em>akyüzlü 'honorable'</em> and <em>karayüzlü</em>\n'dishonorable,' 'disgraceful.'  The use of <em>kara</em> 'black' in Turkish\nidioms to convey a negative connotation is especially common,\nfor example: <em>kara haber</em> 'black news' meaning news of\ndisaster or death; <em>kara kiş</em> (lit: 'black winter'), meaning severe\nwinter or depth of winter; <em>kara yazi</em> (lit: 'black writing'),\nmeaning evil fate or ill luck.  Some Turkish verbs also reflect\nthis usage, for example, <em>aklatmak</em> (lit: 'to make white') and\n<em>aklanmak</em> 'to be whitened' are used to mean, respectively, 'to\nacquit' or 'rehabilitate' and 'to be acquitted.'  As another example:\n<em>akla karayi seçmek</em> (lit: 'to separate the white from\nthe black') is used to mean 'to distinguish between good and\nevil' or 'to distinguish between the easy and the difficult.'</p>\n<p>To return to Eisiminger's article, I would like to make\none final comment.  He writes: “To be <em>essere al verde</em> 'in the\ngreen' in Italian is 'to be in the (English) red,' that is, in\ndebt.”  I must dispute that definition and, on the basis of eight\nyears' residence in Italy, assert that the phrase actually means\n“to be broke, to be penniless or to be at the end of one's\nresources.”  <em>The Cambridge Italian Dictionary</em> (Cambridge,\n1962), p. 856, supports me in that contention.</p>\n<p><em>[Robert Devereux, Falls Church, Virginia]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
