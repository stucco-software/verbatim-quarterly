The Norwegians also consciously\nstrive to keep their language “pure,” and though\nthey haven't capitulated to the degree the Germans seem to\nhave done, they have been fighting an uphill battle,\nespecially since the discovery of oil in the North Sea, with\nits accompanying flood of semi-technical terms.  The following\nstory may help to illustrate some of their difficulties.</p>\n<p>A number of years ago, hydrofoil boats were put into\nuse as part of the coastal transportation system.  Since\n<em>hydrofoil</em> is a construction distinctly alien to Norwegian, the\nSpråkråd (the language advisory committee) sat down to\nproduce a new Norwegian word for this new type of boat.\nAfter seven years of deliberation and debate, they finally\nagreed upon <em>vingebåt/vengjebåt</em> ('wing-boat,' in two forms,\nas there are two written forms of Norwegian).  However, by\nthat time everybody had got used to the term <em>hydrofoil</em>, and\nnobody seemed to realize what a “wing-boat” was, so in the\nend the Språkråd voted to adopt <em>hydrofoil</em> as the officially\nrecognized term.  I am quite in agreement with Mr. Eisiminger's\nobservations on the desirability of languages' remaining\nopen to foreign influences, particularly as regards\n“world languages” like English or French, and other\n“strong,” widely-based languages, like German.  The cases\nof Icelandic, with only 225,000 speakers, and Norwegian,\nwith its four million speakers, a wide variety of dialects,\nand two written forms, are somewhat different.  Such narrowly\nbased languages are in danger of being overwhelmed\nby the influence of English, in particular, and, without the\ncritical attitude of the purists, may be in danger of being\ndestroyed, or at least changed into unrecognizability.  That\nis not to say that all foreign influences are bad, even for\nlanguages spoken by few people, but just that foreign words\nshould not be accepted into a “weak” language unless they\nserve some very good purpose that native words cannot.  To\nput it quite simply, the defense mechanism mentioned by\nMr. Eisiminger is much more important and must operate\nmore consistently in small countries than in big ones.</p>\n<p><em>[J.D.
