Spears, (Jonathan David Publishers, Middle Village, 1981), xxviii + 448pp.</p>\n<p>Rawson's <em>Euphemisms</em> and Spears's <em>Slang</em> basically deal\nwith the same subject matter but are diametrically opposed in\napproach.  Rawson, a professional journalist, presents some\n1,500 entries of positive and negative euphemisms, mostly well\nexplained, precisely dated, and amply illustrated by anecdotes\nor citations from literature and the media.  Spears, a professional\nlinguist, lists some 17,500 entries, tersely defined,\nvaguely dated, and poorly cross-referenced.  Both books are\nuseful for anyone dealing with language.  Rawson's main value\nis the extensive treatment of most entries, thereby greatly\nincreasing one's repertoire of word stories and histories, and he\nprovides an excellent introduction to euphemisms, or “linguistic\nfig leaves,” used in daily life and particularly by the notorious\neuphemizers: business, education, and government.  His 11-page\nintroduction to euphemisms is among the best I have seen.  In\nshort, this book is an amusing, intelligent, well documented,\ninformative, and readable reference work.</p>\n<p>Spears's <em>Slang</em> is useful, too, but for other reasons: the far\ngreater number of entries, the valuable lists of synonyms, and\nthe broader historical and geographic coverage.  While Rawson\nbroadly discusses some 70 synonyms for “prostitute,” Spears\nlists some 560 euphemisms and dysphemisms.  Spears's book is,\nhowever, a most frustrating, vexing product of a professional\nlinguist who created a skeletal data base with his computer\n(limiting most entries to 254 bytes) and then inexplicably hid\nthe best parts of his corpus—the synonym lists—under silly key\nwords.  Subtitled <em>A Dictionary of Oaths, Curses, Insults, Sexual\nSlang and Metaphor, Racial Slurs, Drug Talk, Homosexual\nLingo, and Related Matter</em>, it has three major flaws: the\ndefinitions and explanations are too brief, the cross references\nare poor, and one can't find the extensive synonym lists.\nFarmer and Henley, in their monumental <em>Slang and Its\nAnalogues</em> (1890—1904), had reasons to hide their sexual\nmaterial under inconspicuous entries.  In 1981, Professor Spears\nhas no censureship-caused reasons to ape Farmer and Henley\nby camouflaging his dirty-word lists.</p>\n<p>For example, if I want to find all the synonyms for <em>fuck</em>\n(which he coyly defines as 'to coit'), I look under <em>fuck</em>.  No luck.\nLet's try <em>to copulate</em>, his sense 1 definition.  Nothing.  Try <em>to\ncoit</em>.  Nix, but references to <em>screw</em> and <em>phallicize</em>, neither of\nwhich helps.  <em>To lay?</em>  Again no help.  Frustrated, I turn to\nFarmer and Henley, Spears's major source of material, to see\nwhere they hid the synonyms: under <em>greens</em> and <em>to ride</em>.  Back\nto Spears, but no luck.  Now vexed, I leaf through the book,\ninspecting every long list of small-caps synonyms.  Finally, on\npage 278, I find all the synonyms for <em>fuck</em>, listed under the key\nword <em>occupy</em>.  <em>Occupy</em>!?  Well, <em>occupy</em> such silly games!</p>\n<p>The extensive lists of synonyms are very useful: one does\nnot have to cull them from the dozens of reference works\nconsulted by Spears (American, British, some Canadian, Australian\nand Caribbean terms, from the 1800s to the 1970s)—but\ntry to find them.  One has to make one's own list of references;\ndon't look at the obvious places, and don't bother with the\ncross references.</p>\n<p>The following is a Guide to Spears's Synonym Lists, which\nthe publishers should incorporate in their next printing, as a\nminimal courtesy to the readers.  A few synonym lists are\nactually where they are supposed to be listed: <em>anus, cunnilingus,\ndeflower, erection, genitals</em> (a few), <em>god, gonorrhea, group\nsex, lecher, lewd, pederast, pimp</em>, and <em>stupid</em>.  Most of the\nsecond group are harder to find: alcohol &gt; [= listed under]\n<em>booze</em>; black woman &gt; <em>raven beauty</em>; breasts &gt; bosom;\nchamber pot &gt; <em>pot</em>; cocaine &gt; <em>nose-candy</em>; coward &gt; <em>yellow-dog</em>;\ndevil &gt; <em>fiend</em>; diarrhea &gt; <em>quickstep</em>; die &gt; <em>depart</em>;\ndrunkard &gt; <em>alchy</em>; fellation &gt; <em>penilingus</em>; fool &gt; <em>oaf</em>; horny &gt; <em>humpy</em> and <em>lust</em>; intoxicated with marijuana &gt; <em>tall</em>; marijuana &gt; <em>mari</em>; masturbate &gt; <em>waste time</em>; mulatto &gt; <em>mahogany</em>;\nNegro &gt; <em>ebony</em> and <em>nigger</em>; oaths &gt; '<em>Zounds</em>; pederast &gt;\n<em>sodomite</em>; policeman &gt; <em>flatfoot</em>; posteriors &gt; <em>duff</em>; prostitute &gt; <em>harlot</em>; sanitary napkin &gt; <em>manhole cover</em>; toilet paper &gt;\n<em>T.P.</em>; urinate &gt; <em>retire</em> and <em>whiz</em>; venereal disease &gt; <em>social\ndisease</em>; whorehouse &gt; <em>brothel</em> and <em>house</em>; woman, girl &gt; <em>bird</em>\nand <em>quail</em>; woman as a sexual object &gt; <em>lay</em> and <em>tail</em>.</p>\n<p>The final group of synonym lists is what I call the\n“crazies” —who in his or her right mind would list, look up, or\nexpect these words listed as synonyms under the words\nfollowing the arrow?  Condom &gt; <em>eel-skin</em>; copulation &gt; <em>smockage</em>;\ndefecate &gt; <em>ease oneself</em>; delirium tremens &gt; <em>ork-orks</em>;\ndrunk &gt; <em>woofled</em>; fart &gt; <em>gurk</em>; ejaculate &gt; <em>melt</em>; female\ngenitals &gt; <em>monosyllable</em> (F&amp;H); female public hair &gt; <em>Downshire</em>;\nghost &gt; <em>revenant</em>; gin &gt; <em>ruin</em>; homosexual male,\nhermaphrodite &gt; <em>epicene, fribble,</em> and <em>queen</em>; Jew &gt; <em>five</em> and\n<em>two</em>; kill &gt; <em>scrag</em>; lesbian &gt; <em>lesbyterian</em>; male genitals &gt;\n<em>virilia</em>; menstruation &gt; <em>floods</em>; mistress &gt; <em>spare rib</em>; naked &gt;\n<em>starkers</em>; nonsense &gt; <em>animal</em> and <em>bullshit</em>; penis &gt; <em>gadget</em> and\n<em>yard</em>; preacher &gt; <em>sky-pilot</em>; pregnant &gt; <em>fragrant</em>; rascal, sneak\n&gt; <em>snoke-horn</em>; semen &gt; <em>mettle</em>; sexual play &gt; <em>firkytoodle</em>;\nslovenly woman &gt; <em>trollymog</em>; syphilis &gt; <em>specific stomach</em>;\ntestes &gt; <em>whirlygigs</em>; toilet &gt; <em>ajax</em> and <em>W.C.</em>; trousers &gt;\n<em>galligaskins</em>; vagina &gt; <em>passage</em>; vomit &gt; <em>york</em>.</p>\n<p>Sort of makes you york, really.  Just what got into this\nIndiana-University-educated doctor, now teaching at Northwestern\nUniversity?  And what about his dozen helpers and the\npublishers' editors?  Are they all bananas (sense 2)?  Incidentally,\nthere are dozens of synonyms for <em>crazy</em>, but I could not find\nsuch a list.</p>\n<p>If you are able to find the synonym lists you want without\nthe preceding Guide, you speak no doubt a strange, Spearsian\nEnglish, to wit: <em>My spare rib, a five and two, is no trollymog.\nWhen she's woofled, she presses her monosyllable against my\nvirilia.  Then, after some good smockage, I ejaculate verbally,\n“I'm melting!  I'm melting!”</em>  'Zounds!  Sounds just like the\nwicked witch.</p>\n<p>Spears's introductory short essays, pp. vii-xix, on Slang,\nEuphemism, Taboo, Distancing, Verbal Aggression, etc., are\nperfunctory; one gets the impression that computer operator\nSpears was not interested in (or knowledgeable of) these topics\nbut had to whip out a few pages.  The extensive bibliography is\nuseful but also flawed; e.g., Legman's volume II of <em>Rationale</em>\nwas not consulted; Read's <em>Graffiti</em> are <em>Classic</em>, not <em>Classical</em>;\nthe 1979 reprint of Roback's <em>Dictionary</em> by Maledicta Press is\nnot listed; and the source for “bad words” since 1977,\n<em>Maledicta</em>, was (apparently intentionally) ignored.  Still, with\nthe preceding Guide of where to find what, every user can\nbenefit from this tome, compiled during five years of selfless\nlabor.  We have to be grateful to Jonathan David Publishers for\nmaking this reference work available, but their editors deserve\na kick in their whirlygigs.  The $12.95 paperback is a steal.</p>\n<p>Reviewing <em>Slang</em> for the <em>Library Journal</em>, a linguistics\nprofessor at the University of Chicago snidely condemned\nSpears's work as “not recommended.”  That young professor is\nfull of <em>clart</em>: Spears's <em>Slang</em> is indeed very much recommended,\ndespite its flaws, for in most cases it provides one with\nrudimentary information that one would have to hunt up by\nconsulting dozens of dictionaries.  As an editor, philologist, and\nlexicographer specializing in slang and “bad” words, I am\nappalled by the book's avoidable flaws.  Yet, for all its faults and\nbizarre organization, one can live with Spears's <em>Slang</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[Reinhold Aman, Waukesha, Wisconsin]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
