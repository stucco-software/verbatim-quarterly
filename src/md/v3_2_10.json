Covering the moisture spectrum pretty well are such items as <em>Wash and Care, Spray 'n Wash, Wash 'n Dri, Tote 'n Dry</em>, and <em>Soft &amp; Dri</em>, mostly in the “beautifying” business.</p>\n<p>There are <em>Bathe 'n Glow</em> (baby lotion), <em>Mop &amp; Glo</em> (floor cleaner), <em>Sweet 'n Low</em> (artificial sweetener) and <em>Punch 'n Gro</em> (garden product).  There are <em>Gloss 'n Toss, Toss 'n Serve, Brown N Serve, Stir N Serv, Mix 'n Drink, Heat 'n Eat, Whip &amp; Chill, Wipe 'n Dipe, Cut 'n Clean, Kleen 'n Shine; Stretch 'n Seal</em> and <em>Scratch &amp; Sniff</em> (the last a notebook).  Then, too, we must remember: <em>Lean &amp; Lively, Long &amp; Silky, Silk 'n Hold</em> and <em>Silk 'n Silver</em>. Finally, let us not forget <em>Tuf 'n Ready</em> and <em>Crisp 'n Tender; Spray 'n Wash</em> and <em>Spray N Vac; Thick &amp; Frosty</em> and <em>Fit &amp; Frosty; Rich 'n Easy, Nice &amp; Easy, Nice 'n Soft</em> and <em>Soft 'n Pretty</em>... and <em>So-on 'n So-forth</em>.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the list is <em>Long 'n Endless</em>.  However, the outlook isn't as bleak as it appears.  Fashions in advertising, like fashions in clothes, change quickly and we shall soon be on a <em>New 'n Different</em> kick.  <em>—Harry Cimring, Hollywood, California</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
