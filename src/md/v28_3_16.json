After I read it with what I can only\ndescribe as finger-licking pleasure (“unputdownable,” as reviewers of thrillers are fond of neologizing), I asked for a subscription for my birthday and,\nwhat's perhaps more surprising, actually got it,\ntogether with a lovely handwritten note from the\nUK publisher.\nBut to the point of this “Epistola,” for there is\none. I wanted to note a small mistake (most likely a\ntypo, given the erudition of the article) in Nick\nHumez's otherwise tremendously entertaining article (“Pants on Fire,” XXVIII/2). The end of footnote 1 states that “[in French], a liar is a <em>menteux</em> .”</p>\n<p>Close, but no cigar: the correct word is actually\nmenteur. I swear this is true!\nFinally, I read with interest Ms. McKean's EX\nCATHEDRA column in the same issue, and found\nmyself hoping that one day I would muster enough\ncourage to actually submit an article to this magazine that manages to be at the same time so learned\nand so much fun. Perhaps an article on the French\nVerlan, since one is sought. In which case I will try\nto “illuminate without condescending” and tell your\nreaders that Verlan is not really like “the Pig Latin\nof French,” with all due respect to VERBATIM's\neditor. The latter does exist, and is called Javanais\n(which is also French for the much more official\nJavanese language, so I'm afraid it's not a politically\ncorrect name, but c'est la vie ...). As in Pig Latin,\nJavanais is (or was, as it went out of fashion years\nago) spoken by adding a nonsense syllable (always\nav or va, hence its name) after each consonant.\nThus, a simple bonjour becomes bavonjavour, and\nthe more complex chaussure 'shoe' is reshaped into\nthe hardly intellegible chavaussavurave. Unlike in\nPig Latin however, the first consonant of the word\nis not moved to the end. Verlan, on the other hand,\nconsists of phonetically switching the first and second syllables of some (not all) two-syllable words,\nso that for instance bonjour becomes jourbon, or\nbizarre turns into the odd zarbi. Verlan itself\nderives its name from l'envers 'reversed' in Verlan.\nSince these rather simple beginnings, Verlan has\nevolved somewhat, so that some Verlan words are\nmore difficult to decipher than others, but that is\nanother story.\nI apologize for being so finnicky (or finicky, or\nfiniking, or finical, take your pick ...), but I assume\nthat is a common trait of a number of your readers.\nIn fact, it is likely that these small matters have\nalready been pointed out to you. But perhaps not\nby French readers, you know, the kind that actually live in Paris and laugh themselves silly when they\nlearn that some grown-ups in the U.S. earnestly\nbelieve that the epitome of a patriotic act is to\nrename French fries into “Freedom fries”...</p>\n<p><em>[Olivier Kaiser]</em></p>",
