Take that universally popular caged bird, the <em>budgerigar</em>, first encountered in the inland of New South Wales and known to the colonists from the 1840s. Its name was first written down as <em>betcherrygah</em>, that being a transliteration of the Yuwaalaraay word <em>gijirrigaa</em> (Yuwaalaraay being a language similar to the better-known Kamilaroi), but the temptation to “explain” the word had triumphed over the etymologizing process as early as 1848, when the spelling <em>budgery garr</em> was preferred, and the first element explained as meaning 'in the black's language—good or handsome.' It is true enough that <em>budgerry</em> (or <em>bujari</em> as it is more correctly transcribed) in the Sydney language Dharuk meant 'good.' But in the Sydney language only, its familiarity to English ears being the result of its taking on in Australian pidgin as a term of approbation from as early as 1790. What more natural than that the White perception of a bird destined to become a plaything of the western world—as evidenced by another of its names, the <em>lovebird</em>—should become paramount. In Australia now the shortened form <em>budgie</em> is in more common use—but that is another story.</p>\n<p>Another world that exercised the etymological imagination is <em>billabong</em>, which owes its currency outside Australia to the familiarity of the “national song,” <em>Waltzing Matilda</em>, of which it is a crucial part. Here again a word was broken down into two elements, <em>billa</em> 'creek' and <em>bang</em> or <em>bung</em> 'dead,' and little thought given to the fact of their independent origin. <em>Billabong</em> is first recorded in the 1830s in southeastern New South Wales as a name in the Wiradhuri language for a watercourse which flows after rain, and hence any backwater, blind creek, or anabranch left in the arm of a river, a pool which is left when the connecting stream dries up. It is not the source of <em>billy</em>, a Scottish dialect word for a milk pail, nor does it have anything to do with the Queensland Aboriginal word <em>bung</em> 'dead,' which passed into Australian pidgin in the 1840s and which developed by the 1880s the application 'bankrupt,' as in <em>the bank's gone bung</em>. Tempting as this suggestion may be, it is geographically and chronologically impossible.</p>\n<p>Yet another Aboriginal word, <em>borak</em>, was held by some to be the etymon of <em>barrack</em>, although the probability has to be that this is a British regional dialect word given a new lease of life in fresh circumstances. <em>Borak</em> was a negative in the Victorian language Wathawurung and was one of a comparatively small number of words which the Aboriginal languages collectively contributed to an on-the-whole short-lived Australian pidgin. <em>Borak</em> was borrowed in the late 1830s and, perhaps because the Dharuk negative <em>baal</em> was already in use, did not last long in its primary sense. But it almost simultaneously developed a secondary sense as a noun meaning 'nonsense, rubbish,' a synonym for the more frequently used <em>gammon</em>, a British cant word for 'guile' or 'deceit' that the convicts brought with them and which also moved in the direction of 'nonsense' or 'humbug.' Oddly, <em>borak</em> was coupled with the verb <em>poke</em> in the phrase <em>to poke borak at</em>, meaning 'to deride,' and this was close enough to the transitive use of the verb <em>barrack</em> 'ridicule, jeer at, verbally abuse' to suggest that the two might be connected. And, in the absence of a memory of its British use, the Aboriginal, being to hand, seemed to some a possible source.</p>\n<p>Again, what needs to be taken into account is the balance of probabilities. It is unlikely that a borrowed word would undergo a significant change in form so quickly and, with hindsight, it is more likely that an impreciseness of meaning caused by unfamiliarity should attend the bringing into vogue of a word amongst those who did not have a dialect memory of it. So <em>barrack</em>, attested as a Northern Irish term for 'bragging,' shifts slightly but not contextually in meaning to the vociferous denigration of a sporting team or a participant in a fight, and admits the converse of this in the intransitive verb <em>barrack for</em> 'support.' And the less said the better about another conjectural etymology which would have it that this partisan practice began in Melbourne and characterized the behavior of the crowd at the police barracks end of the ground.</p>\n<p>Such behavior was often associated with <em>larrikins</em>. And the etymology of this word has also been hotly disputed, even if mostly by the lunatic fringe. The golden rule has to be that, if there is a historically valid source, it is to be preferred unless the circumstantial evidence makes a mockery of it. In this case the presence of a high proportion of British regional dialect speakers amongst the convicts and settlers who emigrated or were transported to Australia argues incontrovertibly in favor of a dialect origin if a potential etymon can be shown to exist. One can, even if there is a perceptible difference between the benign <em>OED</em> definition “a mischievous or frolicsome youth” and the Australian “a young urban rough.” The circumstantial evidence provided by the historical dictionary's quotations documents the shift, and there is no case for resorting to the fable that the word derives from the description of such youths “larking” about.</p>",
