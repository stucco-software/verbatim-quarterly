Our plan for her thesis was to count the Gallicisms in the annual reports of the Protestant Schoolboard of Greater Montreal for 1970 and 1980 and to compare them. We carefully considered spelling, punctuation, and vocabulary, reasoning that such texts must have been prepared by several people and vetted many times, so the texts must have seemed unexceptional to their writers and editors. We found twice as many Gallicisms in the 1980 text as in that for 1970.</p>\n<p>Textual rules of French seem normal to native speakers of Quebec English. For example, the spelling of the name of the Benedictine monastery St-Benoît du Lac contains a hyphen instead of a period, as well as a circumflex accent.</p>\n<p>French names for foods are common: <em>poulet frit</em> 'fried chicken' <em>Kentucky; moules</em> 'mussels'; <em>frites</em> 'French fries'; <em>poutine</em> 'French fries with curd cheese and gravy' (named after a Colonel Poutine who was in charge of provisions at the Siege of Quebec in 1749; at the end, the only stores remaining were potatoes, cheese, and chicken stock; local folk etymology has it from <em>putain, putanesca</em>); <em>aubergine</em> 'eggplant' (the usual word in Britain); <em>jarret de boeuf</em> 'shin of beef'; <em>caribou</em> a fortified sweet wine, etc.</p>\n<p>Some examples of peculiar usage: we pay at the <em>cash</em> 'cashier's station' in the <em>wicket</em> 'grated window'; we <em>lose</em> 'waste' <em>time</em>; we <em>open</em> 'turn on' and <em>close 'turn off' the light</em>; and we say <em>il y a rien là</em> 'there's nothing to it,' literally, 'there's nothing there.' We watch out for the <em>S.Q.</em> 'Sureté du Québec' (police) on the <em>autoroute</em> 'interstate'; if you are going to the <em>dépanneur</em> 'handy store' (a “mom-and-pop store”), stop at the <em>S.A.Q.</em> 'Société des Alcools du Québec' (liquor store).</p>\n<p>We receive <em>subventions</em> 'subsidies'; we give <em>conferences</em> 'lectures' and <em>lectures</em> 'readings'; we have several years of <em>scholarity</em> 'schooling'; belong to <em>syndicates</em> 'unions'; have fond <em>souvenirs</em> 'memories'; attend <em>colloques</em> 'colloquia'; serve as <em>animators</em> 'leaders'; ride on the <em>metro</em> 'subway'; and we eat <em>hot dogs steamé all dress</em> 'steamed hot dogs with the works.'</p>\n<p>Typical Canadian pronunciation is found in Quebec English, such as raising—actually incomplete shifting—of the /au/ phoneme, and the Briticisms <em>been</em> /bin/, <em>tourniquet</em>/ 't\\?\\rnike/, and <em>again</em> /\\?\\gen. There is increasingly a syntactic change in the use of the present perfect for the simple past, as in <em>I have noticed that last year</em>. The present perfect in English has the same structure as the French <em>passé composé</em>, but traditionally it has had a different meaning; this usage may not be peculiar to Quebec: perhaps it is spreading in North America.</p>\n<p>Recently, a Francophone taking calls on CBC (English) Radio in Montreal said, “May I make a precision ['clarify something'] for your auditors ['listeners']?” Those who speak neither the dialect nor French would be unable to understand that question.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
