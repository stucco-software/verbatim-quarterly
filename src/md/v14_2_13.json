The style is\nthat of a dictionary, with entries set on a very open\npage, in comfortably large type, accompanied by\npronunciations, and occasional “filler” illustrations.  The\npronunciations are given in the style of the “Moo Goo\nGai Pan” school, e.g., <em>bona fide</em> is “BAW-nah FIH-deh”\nand <em>intra vires</em> is “IN-trah WEE-rays.”  The approach is to\ngive the so-called restored pronunciation, that is, the\nsounds that classics scholars think is closest to the way\nCaesar, Horace, and their contemporaries would have\nsaid things.  This betrays Ehrlich's education as a classicist\nand, while arguably a scientific method of showing\npronunciation, it runs counter to the way non-classicists\nuse or have heard Latin pronounced.  (Though, in the\nexample for <em>intra vires</em> given above, Ehrlich's pronunciation\nsuggests a final <em>z</em>-sound by the use of “-rays,”\nwhen final <em>s</em> is technically correct, and “-race” would\nhave been a better rendering.  Of course, the more common\nEnglish pronunciation of <em>vires</em> in the expression\nwould be “VIH-rays,” so Ehrlich's version is here really a\nhybrid.)  Lawyers particularly are given to highly anglicized\npronunciations—just ask a lawyer to pronounce\n“writ of certiorari”—and that tradition, along with the\n(now fading) “Church” pronunciation of Roman Catholic\nliturgy, is much stronger among the general public\nthan the classicists'.  Ehrlich's pronunciation for “<em>de iure</em>\n(or <em>de jure</em>)” is “day YOO-reh.”  This sort of style is precious,\non two accounts: <em>de jure</em> is by far the more common,\nnot the secondary spelling in English; and virtually\nno one says anything but “day JUH-ray” in English\ncontexts.  Many would lament the decline of training in\nthe classics in our society, but that sentiment does not\nlend authority to the use of a scholar's mode of pronunciation\nin a dictionary for popular consumption.  (To\nbaldly state, as is done in the “Pronunciation Notes,”\nthat “the Latin <em>c</em> is pronounced as though it were a <em>k</em>.\nThus, <em>Cicero</em> is pronounced KIH-keh-roh” is overly simplistic\nand very misleading.)</p>\n<p>The real stuff of the dictionary is, as it should be,\nthe definitions, and they are both very good and very\nreadable.  Accuracy and completeness of defining—with\nboth literal and metaphoric, or extended senses set\nforth—is everywhere in evidence.  The definitions often\nprovide a window into a bit of Roman cultural heritage—all\nwithout dry or preaching pedantry.  The almost\nstudied unattractiveness and stodginess that characterize\nso many classical references and texts (a subtle\nbut contributing factor to the decline of interest?)  are\nrefreshingly absent from this book, as these examples\nmay illustrate:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>horribile dictu</em> horrible to relate</p>\n<p>In describing a particularly bloody automobile\naccident, for example, one might interject\n<em>horribile dictu</em> just before launching into the\nmost shocking details of the narrative.  (See\nMIRABILE DICTU.)</p>\n<p><em>mirabile dictu</em> wonderful to relate</p>\n<p>The phrase to use when one wishes to express\nastonishment while recounting an event of\noverwhelming significance or accomplishment or\nirony.  “Then, as the child watched, the figure,\n<em>mirabile dictu</em>, rose high in the air and vanished.”\n“As he left the penitentiary, where he\nhad just completed a two-year sentence for stealing\npublic funds, he announced, <em>mirabile dictu</em>,\nthat he would be a candidate for a second term\nin the United States Senate.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lightness of tone that is indication of the author's\njoy for the subject pervades this dictionary and is\none of its most gratifying features.</p>\n<p>In addition to the higher frequency terms that\none is likely to encounter—<em>alma mater, cum grano\nsalis, ne plus ultra</em>, and <em>sine qua non</em> are all here,\nand nicely defined—certain more common and insightful\nproverbial expresssions were selected, too, for\ninclusion among the roughly 1400 entries.  These add\nan element of human interest to the dictionary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>bis vivit qui bene vivit</em> he lives twice who lives\nwell</p>\n<p>Milton, in <em>Paradise Lost</em>, couched the same\nwisdom in these words:</p>\n<p>Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou\nliv'st</p>\n<p>Live well; how long or short permit to\nHeaven.</p>\n<p>So we are being told that quality of life is much\nmore important than longevity.  But <em>bis vivit qui\nbene vivit</em>, besides counseling us to lead productive\nlives, offers a consoling thought to recall\nwhen a friend dies young.</p>\n<p><em>disputandi pruritus ecclesiarum scabies</em> the theologian's\nurge to debate is an incurable disease</p>\n<p>Sir Henry Wotton, 1568-1639, an English\npoet and diplomat, wrote this sentence, literally\n“an itch for disputation is the mange of the\nchurches,” in <em>Panegyric to King Charles</em>, and it\nwas later used as part of Wotton's own tombstone\ninscription.  (Wotton is also recalled for his\ndefinition of an ambassador: “an honest man\nsent to lie abroad for the good of his country.”)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no denying that <em>Amo, Amas, Amat</em> and\n<em>More</em> is a source of real enjoyment and enlightenment,\na rare enough combination.  It is likely to remain serviceable\nfor as long as the pages hold up.  (One annoying\ntechnical flaw: the copy reviewed had several\npages where the printing was blurred, not, one hopes,\nevidence of generally low-quality production standards.)\nAnd it is well worth adding that Ehrlich fashioned\nhis dictionary around a sound and clearly stated\nconcept, then executed it with diligence and grace.  It\nis hard to imagine that anyone could be justifiably\ndisappointed with this book.  It is a dictionary of real\nand enduring value—and fun, too.</p>\n<p><em>Frank R. Abate</em></p>",
