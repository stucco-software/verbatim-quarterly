Other prime moroxes are <em>unbelivably real</em>\n(popular among the video generation), <em>awfully good</em>\n(British usage), and <em>kind of cruel</em> (a morox version of\nthe <em>Hamlet</em> oxymoron cited at the beginning).</p>\n<p>What one learns in the hunt for the morox—\nwhich sounds like a line from either Dr. Seuss or Lewis\nCarroll—is that bad examples abound, and the moot\nvalidity of borderline instances may keep one awake at\nnight.  Does <em>terribly nice</em> qualify?  How about <em>acutely\nunaware or exactly wrong</em>?  Or does the faint smell of\ncontrivance hang around them?  <em>He is completely\npartial</em>—now, there's a morox, depending on an unintentional\nmeaning of <em>partial</em>—but how about the old\ngas-tank observations, <em>half full</em> and <em>half empty</em>?</p>\n<p>One starts to collect likely-looking adverbs and\nadjectives for moroxes, such as <em>simply</em>— —, <em>strongly</em>—\n—, and <em>strangely</em>— —.  Except that <em>simply complex</em>\ndoesn't cut it, and neither does <em>strongly weak</em> or\n<em>strangely normal</em>.  Contrived, all of them, though the\nlast may qualify as a legitimate oxymoron.</p>\n<p>The latest ones I am working on include <em>absolutely\nrelative, just unfair</em>, and maybe—just maybe—\n<em>acutely dull</em>.  I am also experimenting with smaller\nunits in sentences, such as, <em>Usually, I go out in the\nstreet, but on off days, I stay at home</em>.  The <em>out in</em> and\n<em>on off</em> combinations are perhaps second cousins to\nmoroxes, but they have that same solecistic slippage,\nto coin an alliteration.  I continue the search for\nmoroxes, but it is hardly easy.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
