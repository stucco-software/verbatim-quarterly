It was at the end of the last war.  A friend, an\nAmerican serviceman, said “Why don't you come over tonight\nand have a drink with us?”  I thought, “Isn't it odd that\nI should be asked to give my reasons for <em>not</em> doing something\nwhich I would enjoy doing?”  I hesitated to answer, and eventually\nmuttered “Yes, I'd very much like to come.”</p>\n<p>The monstrous habit of saying “Why don't you?”  when\nyou mean “Would you care to?”  began, I believe, in the\nUnited States.

Only the guerilla tactics of\nunexpected attack offer any chance against it.  The proper\nweapon is the anti-<em>whynot</em> bomb, a verbal Molotov cocktail,\nwhich you mix yourself and hurl with pretended innocence at\nthe offender.</p>\n<p>If, for argument's sake, you are assailed with “Why don't\nyou come with me on Sunday to see Charles?”  you answer: “Because\nI promised to take Maggie to her aunt in Eastbourne.”</p>\n<p>You can load your charge with different explosives: “Why\nnot come and have dinner with us on Tuesday night?”  can, in\nhostile fashion, be countered by “Because I've had poor\nreports of your cooking,” but it is more tactful to say: “Because\nI promised to take Betty to the theatre.”  The society\ndoctor who likes to tempt his patients with “Why not go for a\ncruise to cure your cough?”  is best given the antidote “Because\nI simply cannot afford it, Doctor.”</p>\n<p>With the right mixture and correct aim every <em>whynot</em>\ncan be blown to pieces.  Let everyone with the will to fight\ntake heart: our position, though difficult, is not hopeless.  Every\nhit demoralises the opponent.</p>",
