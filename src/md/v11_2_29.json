It is impossible to be funny\nor even amusing for 324 pages, so lannelli tries, <em>pari passu</em>, to\nbe sardonic, sarcastic, bitter, paronomastic, poetic, and various\nother things.

It\nranges from</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Plymouth Rock</em>  A kind of popular music originating\nin south of England.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which I could have done without, to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>masochist</em>  A person who is fit to be tied.</p>\n<p><em>beard</em>  The hair on the face of a man who is\nextremely careful, and who therefore does not\nexperience many close shaves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and from</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>acrophobia</em>  Morbid fear resulting from the ancient\nsuperstition that falling to the ground from a great\nheight brings bad luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>actor</em>  Someone whose job frequently alternates\nbetween memorizing lines at the theatre and standing\nin lines at the unemployment office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As can be seen, some are corny, some are cute, some are\nneither.  Occasionally there is a poignant entry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>deer</em>  An animal which is too beautiful for words,\nand so it is shot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem with such books, as I have pointed out on\nmany occasions, is that alphabetic order, which is a useful\nretrieval system if you know what you are looking for, is not\nparticularly well suited for browsing or reading.  Perhaps this\nbook would work better were the entries arranged thematically.\nAs it is, one has to read through it to find the good stuff, which\nis not a thrilling prospect, notwithstanding the fact that much\nworthwhile material is here, though one should take it in small\nquantities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>mithridatism</em>  The act of taking poison in increasing\ndoses as a means of building an immunity to it, as in\nthe case of people who start out with talk shows and\ngradually work their way up to situation comedies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
