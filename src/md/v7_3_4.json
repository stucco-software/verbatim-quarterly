Shapiro</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Wesleyan University</span></em></p>\n<p>For any who might have thought that “Turkish agglutination”\nwas a confectioner's process for the manufacture\nof <em>loukoum</em>, Robert Devereux's article [VII, 2] was most\ninstructive, with its awe-inspiring and jaw-inspiring <em>muvaffakiyetsizliklerimizdendirki</em>.\n(Turkologist friend Clive Foss\nassures me that a more “legitimately Turkish” expression of\nequal length would be <em>turkleştiremediklerimizdenmisiniz</em>,\nmeaning “Are you one of the people we couldn't turn into a\nTurk?” But who's going to quibble?) It immediately set me\nto looking for other worthy examples. What language could\nrival such a protracted yet utterly logical construct? Perhaps\nseveral Amerindian and Eskimoan tongues, but they are on\nthe fringes of the Occidental ken and are spoken by relatively\nfew. Perhaps German? I recalled once seeing, years ago,\nin a Ripley's <em>Believe It Or Not</em>, a gargantuan German word\nallegedly meaning 'handkerchief.' But it was really only a\nfactitious invention meaning something like 'manually-held\nnasal-passage-mucosa-evacuation square-fabric-receptacle,'\nall agglutinated in characteristically Teutonic wordchaintogethergathering.</p>\n<p>Then it hit me. There is perhaps no other widely\nknown language as potentially rich in agglutination as\nEsperanto. Turkish had flung down its 33-letter gauntlet,\nand, staunch defender of the Internacia Lingvo, I could not\nlet it lie there. Fifteen minutes and a cup of strong coffee\nproduced the resounding <em>fimalsamseksemulinarejestrinegaĉideco</em>,\nproudly surpassing its upstart Turkish antagonist\nby a full four letters. (For non-Esperantist readers, it is, of\ncourse, pronounced exactly as written, as long as one\nremembers that j = y, ĉ = ch, c = ts, and that the accent,\nas always, is on the penult.) Another cup of coffee would\nhave surely let me agglutinate still further.</p>\n<p>An exegesis of the term will help illustrate Esperanto's\nlimit-stretching agglutinative genius. It all begins, appropriately,\nwith sex:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>seks(o)</em> 'sex.' Note that the ending of all Esperanto nouns\nis -<em>o</em>. (Other endings being used for other grammatical\nfunctions, I parenthesize the endings to indicate\nthe root.)</p>\n<p><em>seksem(a)</em> 'sexually inclined.' The suffix -em(a), with the\nadjectival ending -<em>a</em>, denotes inclination.</p>\n<p><em>samseksem(a)</em> 'homosexual.' The prefix <em>sam</em>- (the root of\nthe adjective <em>sam(a)</em>, 'same') produces the usual Esperanto\nword for 'homosexual,' literally 'same sex\ninclined.'</p>\n<p><em>malsamseksem(a)</em> 'heterosexual.' The prefix <em>mal</em>- regularly\ndenotes the opposite of the word to which it is\nappended. Hence <em>malsam(a)</em>, 'different.' (Purists\nmight object that, in everyday Esperanto, the word\nfor 'heterosexual' is <em>aliseksem(a)</em>, literally 'other sex\ninclined'; but <em>malsamseksem(a)</em> would be easily\nunderstood.)1</p>\n<p><em>malsamseksemul(o)</em> 'heterosexual person.' The suffix\n<em>ul(o)</em> indicates an individual characterized by the\nword to which it is added.</p>\n<p><em>malsamseksemulin(o)</em> 'female heterosexual.' Esperanto\nregularly forms the feminine by adding the suffix\n-<em>in(o)</em> to the masculine.</p>\n<p><em>malsamseksemulinar(o)</em> 'female heterosexual group.' The\nsuffix -<em>ar(o)</em> indicates an association or grouping of\nindividual persons or things.</p>\n<p><em>malsamseksemulinarej(o)</em> 'female heterosexual group\nquarters.' The suffix -<em>ej(o)</em> indicates the characteristic\nplace of action.</p>\n<p><em>fimalsamseksemulinarej(o)</em> 'brothel.' The prefix <em>fi</em>- adds\nthe idea of shamefulness to what follows, thus producing\nthis easily understandable result, synonymous\nwith the more usual Esperanto term <em>bordel(o)</em>. (By\none of those ambiguities rarely encountered in Esperanto\n—<em>ipso facto</em>— the <em>fi</em>- could logically refer to\nthe <em>ulin(oj)</em>, 'female persons,' or to their <em>ar(o)</em>,\n'group,' as readily as to their <em>ej(o),</em> 'place of operation.'\nBut given the context, it's as broad as it is\nlong.)</p>\n<p><em>fimalsamseksemulinarejestr(o)</em> 'brothel keeper.' Esperanto\nadds the suffix -<em>estr(o)</em> to denote leadership of an\noperation.</p>\n<p><em>fimalsamseksemulinarejestrin(o)</em> 'madam.' As before, the\nsuffix -<em>in(o)</em> feminizes the noun.</p>\n<p><em>fimalsamseksemulinarejestrineg(o)</em> 'large madam.' The\nsuffix -<em>eg(o)</em> is an augmentative.</p>\n<p><em>fimalsamseksemulinarejestrinegaĉ(o)</em> 'slovenly large\nmadam.' The suffix -<em>aĉ(o)</em> is used to imply disparagement\nand general disgust.</p>\n<p><em>flmalsamseksemulinarejestrinegaĉid(o)</em> 'slovenly large\nmadam's offspring.' The suffix -<em>id(o)</em> denotes progeny.</p>\n<p><em>fimalsamseksemulinarejestrinegaĉidec(o)</em> 'quality of a\nslovenly large madam's offspring.' The suffix -<em>ec(o)</em>\n(like English -<em>ness,</em> -<em>ship,</em> etc.) indicates the abstract\ncharacteristics of its referent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Who will deny that being told one possesses “the\ncharacteristics of a gross bordello madam's offspring”—\n<em>fimalsamseksemulinarejestrinegaĉidecon</em>, with an extra -n at\nthe end for the objective case, adding yet another letter—is\nmore picturesque than being called a pedestrian “no-good\nsonofabitch”? (Or even “no-good daughterofabitch” if\nanother feminine -<em>in</em> is inserted after the -<em>id</em>, thus raising the\ngrand total to forty letters: <em>fimakamseksemulinarejestrinegaĉidinecon</em>.)\nSurely such withering invective is more satisfying\nboth to give and to receive.</p>\n<p>I hasten to add that, Esperanto existing to facilitate\ncommunication, few adepts would have occasion to use this\nword in casual conversation. It would not spring trippingly\nto the lips of even the most fluent. Still, it is comforting to\nknow that it, and countless potential others like it, can be\nsummoned up into existence whenever the need for a supersesquipedalianistically\nimposing term arises.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
