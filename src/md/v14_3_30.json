Morgan about a previous EPISTOLA of David\nMiles [XII,4].</p>\n<p>I disagree with A. J. Morgan on the following\npoints:</p>\n<p>(1)  As an adjective, in Italian, <em>bravo</em> is not a low-key\ndescriptive (Where on earth did he get this notion?)\nbut a wide-ranging adjective that could be\ntranslated into English as 'good,' 'clever,' 'competent,'\n'efficient,' 'skilled,' 'excellent,' etc., depending on the\ncontext.</p>\n<p>(2)  I find it hard to believe that “Sii bravi mentre\nla mamma é fuori” has been taken from an Italian\ndictionary (Which one?) because it contains a grammatical\nmistake so unnatural to Italian ears that it is\nvery unlikely to occur, even amongst illiterate persons.\n“Sii” is the form of the imperative, second person singular,\nof the verb <em>essere</em> 'to be,' while <em>bravi</em> is plural;\nthe correct version is therefore “Sii bravo” (a boy), “Sii\nbrava” (a girl), “Siate bravi” (boys, or children), or\n“Siate brave” (girls).</p>\n<p>(3)  As an “esclamazione” (not the same as “interiezione”),\n“Bravo!” is a compliment directly addressed to\nthe performer(s): a tenor is acclaimed with a “Bravo!,”\na soprano with a “Brava!,” and a trio by shouts of\n“Bravi!”  If, in an Italian theater or concert hall, you\nhear a female performer or a group of performers being\naddressed as “Bravo!” you can safely take bets:\nthere are foreigners in the audience.</p>\n<p>The expression <em>Accogliere dei “Bravo” che non\nfinivano più</em> is certainly correct in Italian, provided\nthat quotes are used around <em>bravo,</em> which is then perceived\nas a literal quotation (in the spoken version, the\nquotes would be rendered by an audible pause before\nthe word <em>bravo</em>).  It is likely, however, that an Italian\nspeaker would replace <em>bravo</em> with the appropriate\nform <em>brava</em> or <em>bravi</em> if he knew that the phrase was\nabout a woman or a group.  (He would then be quoting\nliterally what he would automatically assume that the\naudience had been shouting.)</p>\n<p>A final question: what makes A.J. Morgan put\nanimals, children, and workingmen in a separate class\nfrom, I suppose, ordinary people, so that a “wet-rag”\nadjective (which <em>bravo</em> is not, anyhow) can be applied\nto them?</p>\n<p><em>[G.
