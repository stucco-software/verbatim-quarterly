In each of the forty chapters of this book he has strung together many of the modern words that linguists have identified as correspondences traceable to the same or similar forms in ancient languages, mainly Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit. It is <em>Word for Word</em> (Edward C. Pinkerton, VERBATIM Books, 1982) written for popular consumption, though no acknowledgment is made to that work in the bibliography, while full credit is given to the Root Section at the back of <em>The American Heritage Dictionary</em> (1969) and to Erik Pokorny's <em>Indogermanisches Worterbuch</em> (A. Francke, 1959). There are just so many ways in which one can say that a given word goes back to some antediluvian form or that some prehistoric reconstruction yielded a word spelled differently in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, German, and English and (usually) meaning something quite different, and Thomas, an adroit writer, has not only plumbed them all but has come up with new and imaginative ways to describe the semantic changes that have occurred. Although linguists agree that Indo-European roots are hypothetical reconstructions which are accordingly, conventionally marked with a precedent asterisk, Thomas treats them as if they were real words, that is, attested forms, dropping the “inconvenience” of the asterisk. Why clutter up a perfectly good book with a constant reminder that one is dealing entirely with theory?</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems faced by specialists in comparative linguistics is not finding attested forms in the ancient languages that, according to the rules of the various sound changes, are identifiable as cognates, but making some sense out of their semantic connection. To gloze over such irreconcilable problems, the author comes up with obfuscating prose like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are some words we simply won't have around the house, not because of their nastiness— although some of them qualify for that word (questionably derived from an even nastier-sounding root <em>nizdo</em>, a bird's NEST, by way of Old French <em>nastre</em>, something strange and bad, Middle English <em>nasti</em>, NASTY, not a good word for the birds' nests in our tree), but because they don't mean at all what they are trying to say, and contain mendacious roots. [p.60]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If that is at all revealing of the semantic connection between <em>nasty</em> and a bird's nest, it has gone past this reader. The passage quoted is not typical of the overwritten style of this book. How are we to understand this?:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OLEAGINOUS is an ONEROUS, OOZING word.</p>\n<p>And I don't much like the turn of language that inserted OGLE into speech. I can't stand the sight of the word, much less its oily sound. I don't need reminding that it came from the root <em>okw,</em> EYE, and I'd as soon forget the Germanic derivative <em>oog</em>. [p. 63]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have little patience for writing that sacrifices accuracy for effect, creates confusion in its wake, and resorts to arch sarcasm when confronted by ignorance (in the sources). Fans of Thomas might disagree, but a little of this goes a long way for me. There is an Index and an unredeeming bibliography.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
