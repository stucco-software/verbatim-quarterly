Novelty catalogues are a novelty in themselves: pens with the company name on them, memo pads with risqué drawings, key rings equipped with a (needed) nose-hair clipper—we have seen them all. Decades ago the Times Square Hotel in New York City gave away mementos in the form of a plastic comb with a shoe-horn at one end, and one could easily recognize surplus goods when a nail file with a button hook at one end was part of a gift kit.</p>\n<p>It takes a lot of imagination to dream up these strange devices, and one is given to wonder what the Taiwanese geniuses who created some of the following could have been thinking of the taste and sanity of their prospective customers (or of their customers' customers):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Phallomèetre</em></p>\n<p><em>Soft electronic crazy axe and hammer (with glass breaking sound)</em></p>\n<p><em>Fragrant pens</em></p>\n<p><em>Coffee-making-type Pen: When the part for making coffee gets hot just by holding it with your hand, it will move up and down, just like real coffee.</em></p>\n<p><em>Vacuum cleaner in shape of fountain pen</em></p>\n<p><em>Letter opener with quartz clock</em></p>\n<p><em>Barbecue ash tray “Fun to smoke”</em></p>\n<p><em>Telephone shaver</em></p>\n<p><em>Ball shaver</em></p>\n<p><em>VW tissue dispenser</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These ingenious gadgets are not the products of one company, for the catalogue (from 1991) is evidently a cooperative venture, and the various manufacturers are identified, in most cases, with the wares offered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Arty Enterprise Co., Ltd.</em></p>\n<p><em>Best Sibling Corporation</em></p>\n<p><em>Family Tree Int'l Corp.</em> (gumball machines)</p>\n<p><em>Fugiboo Industrial Corp.</em> (hand-wrapped flowers)</p>\n<p><em>Mean An Company Ltd.</em></p>\n<p><em>PoGo Industrial Co., Ltd.</em> (golden and silver hair brushes)</p>\n<p><em>Shiny Fixture Ltd.</em> (halogen lamps)</p>\n<p><em>Ta-choo</em> (quartz clocks)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I was a lad, I was completely beguiled by Japanese water flowers, tiny clamshells that one dropped into a glass of water and watched while they slowly opened and a beautiful paper flower unfolded before one's (very) eyes. As a matter of fact, I am still beguiled by them, but have no idea if they are still made and, if so, where to find them.</p>",
