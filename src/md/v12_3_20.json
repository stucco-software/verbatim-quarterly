In her analysis of song forms,\nshe notes that lyrics are attached to melodies which, with\nindividual variations, fall into permutations of two or occasionally\nthree sections, of which some formulas have been\nwith us since the 1800s.  She discusses AAA (“By The Time I\nGet To Phoenix”), AB (“Oh!

Elegant craftsmanship\nthere may be, but the success of a pop song depends on the\nessential “hook”—a phrase, concept, or rhyme which, like\nthe proverbial plank on the mule's head, grabs the listener's\nattention.  Moreover, words must complement the melody\nemotionally, although occasional irony is possible when an\nostensibly cheerful lyric is belied by a sad melody.  Furthermore,\nlyrics must be singable, with the needs of voice production\nand ease of pronunciation ever borne in mind.\nWhen the pressure of writing to a deadline is considered\nalong with all of these professional requirements, one must\nfeel deep respect for the masters of such an exacting discipline.</p>\n<p>It is to the author's credit that she gives the songwriters\nof the present era their due and does not confine her discussion\nto the gems of Lorenz Hart, Cole Porter, and Ira Gershwin.\nIn truth, contemporary writers such as Paul Simon and\nBob Dylan present emotions and concepts unthinkable in\nterms of older norms.  The writers of today come in various\nstripes, of course.  There are those who continue in the tradition\nof the earlier show and film score craftsmen—Stephen\nSondheim and Marilyn &amp; Alan Bergman come to mind\nimmediately—and those whose orientation is to the age of\nrock music.  The latter, who have so greatly expanded the\nsubject matter and emotional range of pop songs, are also,\nunfortunately, responsible for a perceptible decline in the\ncraft in terms of exact rhyming.  It is true that great poetry\nof the past is filled with substitutes for exact rhyme, but one\nsuspects that the rock-oriented writers are not prepared to\noffer Milton's use of consonance (<em>food-stood</em>) and assonance\n(<em>meet-seen</em>) in <em>Paradise Lost</em> as justification for their sins.\nDavis sadly admits that simple ineptitude is more likely to\nbe at the root of the prevalence of false rhymes.  She catalogues\nthese, in addition to consonance and assonance, as\npararhyme (<em>nine-noon</em>), unstressed (<em>given-heaven</em>), augmented\n(<em>harbor-starboard</em>), and, particularly popular with\npresent-day writers, diminished (<em>ground-town</em>).  After\nenough hearings, lyrics such as “You've been running\naround, All over town” seem less offensive to our ears; our\nstandards have become lowered.</p>\n<p>For readers of VERBATIM, at any rate, examples of classic\nfull rhyme from the golden age of musical comedy are, as\nalways, inspiring.  The inspiration of Porter, Hart, Ira\nGershwin, P.G. Wodehouse, Oscar Hammerstein, Yip\nHarburg, and the rest was indubitably W.S. Gilbert.</p>\n<p>From “The Sorcerer” (1877), a paean to a dealer in\nmagic and spells:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For he can prophesy<br>\nWith a wink of his eye<br>\nPeep with security<br>\nInto futurity<br>\nSum up your history<br>\nClear up a mystery<br>\nHumour proclivity<br>\nFor a nativity,<br>\nWith mirrors so magical<br>\nTetrapods tragical<br>\nBogies spectacular<br>\nAnswers oracular<br>\nFacts astronomical<br>\nSolemn or comical.<br>\nAnd if you want it, he<br>\nMakes a reduction<br>\nin taking a quantity...<br>\nThen if you plan it, he<br>\nChanges organity,<br>\nWith an urbanity<br>\nFull of Satanity<br>\nVexes humanity<br>\nWith an inanity<br>\nTotal to vanity<br>\nDriving your foes<br>\nto the verge of insanity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Consider Hart's “Mountain Greenery” (1926), and\nnote, by the way, that the lyric came after the melody had\nbeen written, as was the usual form of Hart's collaboration\nwith Richard Rodgers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Verse:</em> On the first of May<br>\nIt is moving day.<br>\nSpring is here, so blow your job,<br>\nThrow your job away.<br>\nNow's the time to trust<br>\nTo your wanderlust.<br>\nIn the city's dust you wait.<br>\nMust you wait?<br>\nJust you wait.</p>\n<p><em>Chorus:</em> In a mountain greenery<br>\nWhere God paints the scenery,<br>\nJust two crazy people together.<br>\nWhile you love your lover, let<br>\nBlue skies be your coverlet;<br>\nWhen it rains, we'll laugh at the weather.<br>\nAnd if you're good<br>\nI'll search for wood,<br>\nSo you can cook<br>\nWhile I stand looking.<br>\nBeans could get no keener reCeption in a beanery.<br>\nBless our mountain greenery home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gershwins also commonly collaborated on a music-first\nbasis, but in all such procedures there must have\nbeen considerable give-and-take on both sides.  A melody can\nbe altered up to a point in order to accommodate a syllable\nor two, and a lyric for a specific stage purpose may well be\nthe stimulus for the composer.  In any case, as Sammy Cahn\nresponded to the eternal query as to which comes first,\n“First comes the phone call.”</p>\n<p>All of these matters are set forth in clear prose by the\nauthor, whose course at The Songwriters Guild in New York\nCity is the basis for this book.  Her presentation is complete\nand highly recommended.</p>\n<p><em>[Dick Hyman, New York City]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
