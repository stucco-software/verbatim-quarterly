Pollock</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Northbrook, Illinois</span></em></p>\n<p>Self-referring sentences, notably the paradoxical “This\nsentence is false,” are sufficiently familiar.  But the notion of\nself-referring <em>words</em> was new, at least for me, when it occurred\nto me the other day while I was waiting for an elevator.\nSelf-referring words denote or describe themselves—for\nexample, the word “word” is itself a word, and the word\n“useful” is itself useful.</p>\n<p>I was already intrigued by these words by the time we\nwere riding up on the elevator.  Other readers of VERBATIM\nmay wish to participate in answering three questions which\nself-referring words raise:</p>\n<p>1.  How many of them are there?</p>\n<p>2.  Can we formulate general principles about them?</p>\n<p>3.  How widely are the categories “self-referring” and\n“nonself-referring” applicable?</p>\n<p>Having posed the questions, any logophile of spirit must\nattempt answers.</p>\n<p>It is obvious that the vast majority of words are not self-referring.\nMy current list follows:</p>\n<p>1.  Nouns</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>THE WORD:</th>\n<th>IS ITSELF A:</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>a.  <em>word</em></td>\n<td>word</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>b.  <em>term</em></td>\n<td>term</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>c.  <em>noun</em></td>\n<td>noun</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>d.  <em>substantive</em></td>\n<td>substantive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>e.  <em>symbol</em></td>\n<td>symbol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>f.  <em>sign</em></td>\n<td>sign</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>2.  Adjectives</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>THE WORD:</th>\n<th>IS ITSELF:</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>a.  <em>useful</em></td>\n<td>useful</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>b.  <em>English</em></td>\n<td>English</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>c.  <em>français</em> (etc.)</td>\n<td><em>français</em> (etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>d.  <em>acceptable</em></td>\n<td>acceptable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>e.  <em>unobjectionable</em></td>\n<td>unobjectionable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>f.  <em>intelligible</em></td>\n<td>intelligible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>g.  <em>meaningful</em></td>\n<td>meaningful</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>h.  <em>understandable</em></td>\n<td>understandable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>i.  <em>thinkable</em></td>\n<td>thinkable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>j.  <em>sesquipedalian</em></td>\n<td>sesquipedalian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>k.  <em>ordinary</em></td>\n<td>ordinary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>l.  <em>analyzable</em></td>\n<td>analyzable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>m.  <em>inflected</em></td>\n<td>inflected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>n.  <em>polysyllabic</em></td>\n<td>polysyllabic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>o.  <em>definable</em></td>\n<td>definable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>p.  <em>expressible</em></td>\n<td>expressible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>q.  <em>printable</em></td>\n<td>printable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>r.  <em>writable</em></td>\n<td>writable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>s.  <em>pronounceable</em></td>\n<td>pronounceable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>t.  <em>speakable</em></td>\n<td>speakable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>u.  <em>utterable</em></td>\n<td>utterable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v.  <em>learnable</em></td>\n<td>learnable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>w.  <em>teachable</em></td>\n<td>teachable</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I have so far three principles:</p>\n<p>1.  Only nouns and adjectives can be self-referring.\nThis is because words themselves are objects in the cultural\nworld; thus they can only be referred to by names or descriptions\nof objects, i.e., by nouns or adjectives.</p>\n<p>2.  Self-referring nouns are always grammatical or\nlinguistic terms applicable to nouns.  This appears to be the\nonly way for a noun to name itself.</p>\n<p>3.  Self-referring adjectives have a wider range of meaning\nthan self-referring nouns, because they can express many\naspects of words (than which nothing has more aspects).\nThe self-referring adjectives listed above bring out, respectively,\nthat words are:</p>\n<p>a.  practical</p>\n<p>b-c.  in some language or other (This class of self-referring\nadjectives is represented in each language I am\nfamiliar with by one word—namely the adjective which describes\nwords, including itself, as being in that language.  As\nan aside, I wonder if, of the few thousand languages there\nare, any is so unselfconscious as not to have a word for itself,\nas one language among many?)</p>\n<p>d-e.   socio-cultural\nf-i.   cognitive\nj-k.   stylistic\nl-n.   structured\no.   semantic\np-u.   variously expressible\nv-w.   pedagogical</p>\n<p>My question here is whether, in principle, every noun\nand adjective can be unambiguously classed as either self-referring\nor nonself-referring.</p>\n<p>It is clear that there might be disagreements about the\nclassification of given words, for reasons such as:</p>\n<p>1.  Different senses of the same word—for example,\n<em>sign</em> in the sense of 'an indication of meaning' is self-referring;\nin the sense of 'an inscribed board used for advertising' it is\nnot.</p>\n<p>2.  Differences in taste or opinion—some people might\nthink <em>interesting</em> interesting and <em>euphonious</em> euphonious;\nother people might not.</p>\n<p>3.  Differences in theory—some people might speculate\nthat words in some sense exist or are things, thus making\n<em>existing</em> and <em>thing</em> self-referring; others' speculations might\nreach opposite conclusions.</p>\n<p>Such disagreements are not objections <em>in principle</em>,\nhowever.  In principle, we can sort out the senses of words,\nand settle or at least understand and handle differences of\nopinion, taste and theory.  But is there a word which cannot\nin principle be assigned to one of our two categories?</p>\n<p>It seems to me there is one: the word <em>nonself-referring</em>.\nIf <em>nonself-referring</em> is nonself-referring, it obviously describes\nitself and thus must be self-referring.  If, on the other hand,\n<em>nonself-referring</em> is self-referring, then it must describe itself\nand be nonself-referring.  So the self-referring word can lead\nus to paradox equally as well as the self-referring sentence.</p>\n<p>Doubtless, as journal articles say, further research of\nthis intriguing subject is needed.  And the inviting field of\nthe self-referring <em>phrase</em> lies all untrodden before us.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
