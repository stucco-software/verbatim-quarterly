Its tone is that of a professor addressing\nhis academic colleagues in a series of informal,\ncommon-room lectures.  It assumes, in other words, that\nhighly literate, thinking readers will give the book the attention\nit deserves.  Such readers will undoubtedly enjoy it\nvery much, for it avoids both the scholarly intensity of P.H.\nReaney's <em>The Origin of English Place Names</em> and the\nstylistic barrenness of Kenneth Cameron's <em>English Place\nNames</em>.  But one wonders just how many such ideal readers\nstill exist.  Even bookish people have become accustomed to\nthe highly imaginative and varied presentation of information\nin good television documentaries.  Had any chapter of\nthis book become the commentary for such a film, it would\nhave been brought to life visually in countless ways.  There\nis little doubt in my mind that generous and imaginative illustration\nwould have made the book of interest to a great\nmany more readers.  As it is, it makes a pleasant bedtime\ncompanion, to be read—and thought about—in small doses.</p>\n<p>C. M. Matthews has previously written several discursive\nworks about both place names and surnames, though\nSir William chooses to ignore them in his Bibliography.\nMrs. Matthews' latest work appears under the Beaver Book\nimprint, a series of paperbacks meant for children, as <em>How\nPlace-names Began</em> (176pp., Hamlyn Publishing Group, 65\npence).</p>\n<p>A bright cover and some rather abstract line drawings\nhave been provided in an effort to turn a solid text into\nsomething more tempting and readable.  These may be\nmoves in the right direction, but children need far more.  I\ntried the book on my own offspring, Stephen (15) and Catherine\n(13).  They simply couldn't get into it.  Looking at it in\ndetail, I think I know why.  It deals with its difficult subject\nmatter in traditional, stolid prose.  There is no <em>dialogue</em> with\nthe youthful reader, no questions to challenge him, no jokes\nto share with him, no real sense of discovery or excitement,\nnot even any real enthusiasm displayed for the subject.\nCommunicating with young people in their own terms is a\nhighly specialized skill, and on the evidence of this book,\nMrs. Matthews does not possess it.</p>\n<p><em>[Leslie Dunking.
