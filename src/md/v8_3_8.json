Turner</span> <span data-rel=\"location\"></span></em></p>\n<p>Some Australians might take the term “colorful language”\nto promise a discussion of the <em>Great Australian Adjective</em>,\nthe word <em>bloody</em>, which Australians are popularly\nsupposed to work into every sentence and even, though it\nmight seem imbloodypossible, into the middle of words.  But\nwhat I have in mind is a further exploration, with relation\nto Australian English, of the kind of semantic associations of\ncolor terms that were discussed by Sterling Eisiminger in\nVERBATIM [VI, 1].</p>\n<p>The positive connotations of <em>white</em> recur with exaggerated\nforce in Australia and New Zealand where, at least\nin older usage, <em>a (real) white man</em> was the highest commendation.\nThe New Zealand poet R.A.K. Mason catches\nthe idiom in his satirical poem <em>Judas Iscariot</em>, where Judas is\ndescribed as “the veriest prince of good fellows and the\nwhitest and merriest.”  Cheap labour from the Pacific\nIslands and Asia was a threat to the living standards of\nAustralian workers in the nineteenth century, and so a\npolicy, called the <em>White Australia</em> policy, of excluding\nimmigrants not of European race was widely adopted,\nthough it is now generally disowned.  A more sinister\nassociation of <em>white</em> comes from the destructive termites,\n<em>white ants</em>.  These insects can quickly eat out timber, leaving\na paper-thin outer shell.  Politicians have sometimes seized\non a metaphor (powerful especially to property owners) <em>to\nwhite-ant</em> institutions or a way of life 'to subvert them\nsecretly from within.'  (Such 'black villains' are usually\n'reds.')  Color names not infrequently turn up in the names\nof drinks: <em>white lady</em> is methylated spirits, pure or mixed\nwith something else.  In sport <em>to whitewash</em> 'to defeat utterly'\nis shared with the U.S., and <em>the man in white</em> is the\nreferee.  For flora and fauna, the pretty little <em>white-eye</em> (also\ncalled <em>silver-eye, blight-bird</em>, etc.) may stand for many\nmore items.</p>\n<p><em>Black</em> retains in Australia the negative associations it\nhad in Europe.  Days of devastating bushfire are remembered\nas <em>Black Saturday</em> (in New South Wales), <em>Black\nThursday</em> (in Victoria), etc.  The simile <em>as black as a burnt\nlog</em> and perhaps <em>black stump</em> 'mythical marker of extreme\ndistance' in the phrase <em>beyond the black stump</em> recall fire-scarred\nlandscape.  Racial associations of <em>black</em> with the\nAboriginal population are respectful enough in <em>black\ntracker</em> but shameful in <em>black velvet</em> (Aboriginal women\nconsidered as sex objects).  Associations are neutral or pleasant\nin <em>blackjack</em> 'treacle,' <em>blackball</em> 'a black and white\nstriped peppermint sweet,' though perhaps faintly pejorative\nin <em>black taxi</em> 'a Commonwealth Government car providing\nfree transport for politicians and public servants' and <em>black\nhat</em>, now obsolete, 'a newly arrived immigrant inexperienced\nin the ways of the colony' (and still wearing city\nclothes).  Flora and fauna again provide a large number of\nexamples of new formations; for <em>black</em>, the index to the\n<em>Australian Encyclopaedia</em> (1966) has two and a half columns\nlisting phrases alone, and there are many compounds\nas well.  Among the more interesting of these are <em>blackboy</em>,\nalso called <em>grass-tree</em>, a black-boled liliaceous tree with a\nspearlike flowerstalk and reedlike leaves resembling fuzzy\nhair or a grass skirt (but in New Zealand the same word\nrefers to a type of peach), and <em>black swan</em>, a descriptive\nterm.  The presence of black swans in Australia indirectly\nexplains the name <em>White Swan Reservoir</em> in Ballarat.  A type\nof ant is the <em>blackhead</em> (other types being <em>greenheads,\nblueheads, redheads</em>, and <em>green-tree ants</em>), and a type of\ncicada, the <em>black prince</em> (other types being the <em>greengrocer,\nyellow Monday</em> and <em>yellow Tuesday</em>; there is also a <em>green\nMonday</em>, the origin of these names being, apparently, by\nfolk etymology, a name of an Aboriginal, mentioned by\nCaptain Watkin Tench in 1791 as <em>Yel-lo-mun-dee</em>, later applied,\nas <em>Yellow Monday</em>, to a creek near Parramatta).</p>\n<p>In Australia as elsewhere, <em>blue</em> has proved rich in associations.\nA <em>blue</em> or <em>bluey</em> may be a 'summons, especially for\na traffic offence' (from the color of the paper) or a <em>blue</em> may\nbe a 'quarrel or mistake' <em>(made a bit of a blue)</em> or just a\n'nickname for a red-headed person.'  The <em>Blues</em> are a N.S.W.\nRugby League team, the <em>Bluebags</em> another.  A <em>bluey</em> is a\n'blanket,' <em>to hump bluey</em> 'to carry a swag, take to the track.'\nThe connotation of <em>blue</em> sometimes seems to be derogatory;\na <em>blue duck</em> is 'something that fails to meet expectations, a\ndud,' and a <em>blue bird</em>, the 'police paddy-wagon.'  The <em>blue\ndevil</em>, however, is merely a 'thistlelike plant' and the tone is\nneutral in <em>bluetongue</em>, a 'lizard with a bright blue tongue,'\nalso, perhaps from confusion with the <em>sleepy lizard</em>, 'a shed-hand\non a sheep-station,' and in <em>blue flyer</em> 'the female of the\nred kangaroo' and <em>blue heeler</em> 'a cattle dog,' if not <em>blue\npointer</em>, 'a large shark'.  There is the <em>bluebottle</em>, a local\nname for the 'Portuguese man-of-war,' <em>blue-eye</em> (a fish) and\n<em>bluefish, bluebush</em>, and, of course, the <em>bluegum.  Bluestone</em>\nis a 'building-stone,' not necessarily blue, in fact more often\nbrown in South Australia, and in early New Zealand the\n<em>blueshirts</em> were a politically radical group, more like the\n'reds' than the 'blues' of today.</p>\n<p>Apart from flora and fauna (<em>redbill, red bream, red\ncedar, red cod, red gum</em>, etc.), <em>red</em> has not formed many\nnew associations in Australia.  Perhaps most notable is the\n<em>Red Centre</em>, describing the red-clay interior of Australia.\nThere is a note of danger in the name of the <em>redback</em> spider,\nthough it is also descriptive: it is the <em>katipo</em> of New Zealand,\nrelated to the American black widow.  Danger again motivates\nthe names <em>red steer</em> or <em>red bull</em> for a bushfire.  There is\npolitical connotation in the <em>red-feds</em> 'members of the Red\nFederation in New Zealand early this century,' but not in\nthe <em>red page</em> the 'literary page of the <em>Bulletin</em>,' actually\ncolored red or pink, in the period of nationalist consciousness\nlate last century.  A fish called <em>nannygai</em> was renamed\n<em>redfish</em>, and this name has proved popular enough to\nimprove its sales, but a <em>green tiger prawn</em> was renamed\n<em>grooved tiger prawn</em> because <em>green</em> suggested an uncooked\nprawn.</p>\n<p><em>Yellow</em> has racial associations in <em>yeller feller</em>, a probably\nobsolete name for a male half-caste, but is otherwise\nconfined to flora and fauna (<em>yellow-tail, yellow-belly</em>, both\nfishes, and <em>yellow-jacket</em>, naming various eucalypts.)</p>\n<p><em>Green</em> gives rise to <em>green bans</em>, which are <em>black bans</em>\nimposed by unions for environmentalist reasons.  Those who\nsupport such actions are <em>greenies</em> (a name also applied to\nvarious Australian birds).  The <em>green cart</em> is the 'van supposed\nto take people to the mental asylum.'  <em>Greenfeed</em> is\nforage fed fresh to livestock.  The <em>green-leek</em> is a parrot and\nthe <em>Galloping Greens</em> a football team.</p>\n<p><em>Purple</em> undergoes no changes here, except that <em>purple\npatch</em> is sometimes used to refer to a run of success or good\nform.  Neither are there new associations for <em>orange</em> except\nin names for flora and fauna, such as <em>orange chat</em> or\n<em>orange-bark</em> (from the color of its inner bark).</p>\n<p><em>Grey</em> enters into <em>greybark</em>, a 'large beetle attacking\nsugar-cane,' <em>grey box</em> (various trees), and <em>grey nurse</em> a 'nasty\nshark.'  The <em>Hexham greys</em> are mosquitoes of exceptional\nsize, associated with a place in New South Wales.  A <em>grey\nmeanie</em> (in Victoria) or a <em>grey ghost</em> (in New South Wales) is\na 'parking policeman': the name is from the color of the\nuniform; earlier, the Sydney traffic warden was dressed in\nbrown and known as a <em>brown bomber</em>.</p>\n<p>Brown and grey are among the more “developed” colors\nappearing at a later stage of technical advance.  In New\nGuinea Pidgin, <em>brown</em> is likely to be referred to as <em>arakain\nret</em> 'another kind of red' and <em>grey hair</em> is <em>waitpela gras</em>,\netymologically 'white grass.'  In Australian English, <em>brown</em>\nappears in the dangerous <em>brown snake, brownie</em> a 'bush\ncake with currants and brown sugar,' the obsolete <em>brown</em> a\n'penny,' and <em>browntop</em> a 'pasture grass.'</p>\n<p><em>Pink</em>, apart from some nineteen flora and fauna words\nlisted in the <em>Australian Encyclopaedia</em>, gives <em>pinkie</em> 'cheap\nwine' or 'drink containing methylated spirits.'</p>\n<p>Fancier words such as <em>crimson, scarlet, rose, tawny,\ngolden, pale yellow, bronze</em> (even <em>nankeen</em> 'buff-colored,'\nappearing in the name of the <em>nankeen night heron</em>) enter into\nnew words for flora and fauna, but even in these special\nvocabularies there are color words (e.g., <em>chartreuse, indigo</em>)\nwhich have no new life in Australia.</p>\n<p>No very surprising result emerges from a study of color\nwords in Australian English.  More perhaps than we think,\nwe are imprisoned in a set of associations formed in Europe\nand especially Britain, though possibly there has been some\nshifting of connotations of approval towards the red end of\nthe spectrum as the language has been brought from “England's\ngreen and pleasant land” to the “wide brown land” of\nAustralia.</p>",
