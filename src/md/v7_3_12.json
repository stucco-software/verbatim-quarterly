The sentence represented\nabove could be read in a rather straightforward\nway*: /2ìl a 3v\\?\\ + 3ky lót1 ↓ / = <em>Il a vingt culottes</em> 'He has\ntwenty pairs of pants.'

A slight variation on this would be:\n/2ìl1 a v\\?\\3ky + 1lót1 → / = <em>Il a vaincu, Lotte</em> = 'He (Lot) has\nconquered.' There is, alas, still a fourth possibility: /2ìl a 3v\\?\\\n+ 3ky + 1lót1' → = <em>Il a vingt culs, Lotte</em>, which I won't\ntranslate, for it is obscene, but will gloss by saying that it\nperhaps accounts for why, in the various versions, a man\nhas twenty pairs of pants or Lot loses or wins!</p>\n<p>Mr. Gumfudgin says: “Maybe what I'm doing is taking\njunctures and making a sentence with them and that's what\nan ormonym really is. Anyway, it's fun and maybe serves to\ncrack a smile here and there; if so, it's worth it.” I am\nreminded of James Joyce's response to the charge that in\n<em>Finnegans Wake</em> he was trivial. “Yes,” he responded. “And\nsometimes I am quadrivial.” So, to go beyond Joyce, I'll\nadd a fifth example: <em>Il l'a vaincu, Lotte</em> = /2ìl + la v\\?\\3ky\n+ 1lót1 →/ 'He (Lot) has conquered it.'</p>\n<p>I have no idea if what I've put forward are ormonyms\nor junctures. But, whatever they are, I hope that, with\nthese five examples, I have conquered them. By the way,\n<em>jointure in</em> French is feminine. I still wonder what Ormly\nis!</p>\n<p>[I am indebted to my friend and colleague Dr. G.K.\ndeHeer, Head of WAIT'S Department of Asian Studies,\nfor the phonemic transcriptions and the fifth example I\ngive. He says, “Since accent, at least primary accent,\ncoincides with juncture, it is really redundant to mark\nboth and + .” I do so for emphasis. Assume the existence\nof a primary accent '., a secondary accent ', and a\nweak or nonaccent.]</p>\n<h1></h1>",
