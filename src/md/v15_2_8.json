It is also a\ngradual process, as evidenced by the sequence of <em>to\nday, to-day, today</em>.</p>\n<p>Of much more interest, however, are the common\nwords used in English that were once compounds but\nare not easily recognized as such today.  Let us reveal\ntheir dual disposition:</p>\n<p><em>Alone</em>, in Middle English, is <em>al</em> 'all' + <em>one</em> 'one'.  If\none is by himself, he, she, or it is alone.  The word is\ngenerally associated with being lonely.</p>\n<p><em>Atom</em> is from the Greek a- 'not' + <em>temnein</em> 'cut.'\nThe atom was named before it was split.  Around 400\nB.C., Democritus theorized that a thing could be divided\nand divided until it became so small it could no\nlonger be divided.  The theory was largely shelved for\ntwo thousand years until several physicists produced\ntheories which led to the fact that the atom could be\nsplit.  Because of this, <em>atom</em> is a misnomer today.</p>\n<p><em>Atone</em> comes from the Middle English <em>at</em> 'at' + <em>on</em>\n'one.'  The term is used largely in the Christian sense of\nJesus dying to atone for the sins of man; his death\nreconciled, “made one,” God and man.</p>\n<p><em>Barn</em> is compounded from the Old English words\n<em>beren</em> 'barley' + <em>ern</em> 'house.'  The barn was the building\nfor storing barley.  Since Anglo-Saxon times, the word\nhas gone through a process of generalization, whereby\nit has taken on a wider range of meaning.</p>\n<p><em>Chair</em> is a Greek compound of <em>kata</em> 'down' +\n<em>hedra</em> 'sit, seat.'  An appropriate name it is for the\nobject in which we sit ourselves down to rest.</p>\n<p><em>Copy</em> is a blend of the prefix, <em>co</em> 'with' + Latin\n<em>opia</em> 'abundance.'  Before the invention of the printing\npress, manuscripts had to be copied by hand.  Since a\nsecond copy exceeded the first by one hundred percent,\nit was considered an abundance.</p>\n<p><em>Daisy</em> is a combination of the Old English words,\n<em>dæges</em> 'day's' + <em>ēage</em> 'eye.'  Perhaps it was so called\nbecause it opens in morning and closes at night, or\nbecause of its eyelike shape.</p>\n<p><em>Denim</em> is a French compound.  In the older days of\nFrance, several towns produced serge, a material for\nmaking clothing.  Of all the towns, the <em>serge de Nîmes</em>\nwas the finest.  <em>Denim</em> is from <em>de</em> 'from' + <em>Nîmes</em>, the\ntown.</p>\n<p><em>Dozen</em> is a mathematically compounded word\nfrom the Latin <em>duo</em> 'two' + <em>decem</em> 'ten.'  Two plus ten\nequals twelve in any language.</p>\n<p><em>Enemy</em> is a combination of the Latin <em>in</em> 'not' +\n<em>amicus</em> 'friend,' and is thus a doublet with <em>inimical</em>.\nThat <em>enemy</em> could be related to <em>amiable</em>, is more than\na little ironic.</p>\n<p><em>Garlic</em> is compounded from the Old English <em>gar</em>\n'spear,' and <em>lêac</em> 'leek.'  Garlic is a member of the family\nof leeks which is related to the onion.  Its blades are its\n“spears.”</p>\n<p>The Old English <em>hlāf</em>, 'loaf' + <em>dige</em> or <em>diīge</em>, variants\nof <em>dæge</em> 'kneader,' combine to make <em>lady</em>.  Apparently,\nthe first kneaders of bread were ladies.</p>\n<p><em>Lariat</em> is compounded from the Spanish <em>la</em> 'the' +\n<em>reata</em> 'lasso.'  Even though <em>lariat</em> contains its own Spanish\narticle, when we imported it into English, we\nadded another, the English <em>the</em>, to create a literal <em>the\nla reata</em>, 'the the lasso,' and we never think of it as\nredundancy.</p>\n<p><em>None</em> is the combined Old English <em>ne</em> 'not' + <em>ān</em>\n'one.'</p>\n<p><em>Obese</em> is a compound of two Latin words, the\nprefix, <em>ob</em>- 'over' + <em>ēdere</em> 'eat.'  Overating is a prerequisite\nfor becoming obese.</p>\n<p>Two Greek elements, ō 'the letter “o” '+ <em>mêga</em>\n'large, great,' combine to make <em>omega</em>.  It contrasts\nwith ō + <em>micron</em> 'small' which form <em>omicron</em>, the\n“smaller” <em>o</em> of the Greek alphabet.</p>\n<p><em>Stirrup</em> has been compounded from the Old English\n<em>stige</em> 'ascent' + <em>rāp</em>.'  Anglo-Saxon stirrups\nwere made of rope and were probably used for ascending\nobjects other than horses.</p>\n<p><em>Windows</em> is compounded from the Icelandic words\n<em>vindr</em> 'wind' + <em>auga</em> 'eye,' a window being the eye of a\nhouse.</p>\n<p>Because they are short—some reduced to only one\nsyllable—such words are not immediately apparent as\ncompounds, and their true nature is exposed only by\nword archaeology.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
