That is not borne out by the entry for <em>dependant</em> in <em>The Random House Unabridged (Third Edition)</em>, which lists it as a mere spelling variant. The <em>OED2e</em> treats it in the same way. One is left to wonder whether the distinction is genuine or not.</p>\n<p>Under the heading American (US) Spelling, reference is made to the <em>Random House Dictionary of the American Language</em>, not a viable title as far as I am aware. That listing offers information that I would find quite confusing; for instance, although the comment is made that “Americans may use the 'British' spelling of some of these words,” it is anybody's guess which are the variable ones: Americans almost never write <em>gramme, programme</em> for <em>gram, program, tyre</em> for <em>tire, sceptical</em> for <em>skeptical</em>, or <em>anaemia</em> for <em>anemia</em>, but they often—more often than not—write <em>archaeology</em> and <em>aesthetic</em> for <em>archeology</em> and <em>esthetic, theatre</em> for <em>theater, gray</em> for <em>grey</em>; while there are “true”—that is, 50/50—free variants in American English: <em>catalog/catalogue, toward/to-wards, undefinable/indefinable, againg/ageing, eying/ eyeing</em>, etc., the only place one encounters <em>honour</em> for <em>honor</em> in American English is in wedding invitations that are trying to be chi-chi. To put <em>shipped/ shipping</em> together with <em>worshiped/worshiping</em> is confusing because of the stressed/unstressed syllable rule in American English, but one must contend with the fact that many Americans are poor spellers, which accounts for the persistence of the local television cable company in spelling <em>pursuant</em> as “persuant” and their incredible reply to a note that they must do so at the behest of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>\n<p>I have a few pet copy-editing peeves, among which is the failure of many writers to omit commas from restrictive clauses and include them in nonrestrictive clauses. Also, I deplore the use of <em>that</em> in non-nonrestrictive clauses, though condone the occasional use of <em>which</em> in restrictive clauses where the sense is clear. Butcher agrees with me on these points. She is less stringent than I—suggesting that the application should be consistent—in the use of the comma before the final <em>and</em> or <em>or</em> in lists of three or more items: training as a lexicographer taught me to use commas in such places in order to obviate ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Generally, I think this book provides clear, useful information, but one must be cautious to keep a dictionary handy to check for preferred spellings and usages. It must be emphasized that dictionaries differ (even within a country) as to the preferred form, for it must be understood that “preferred” is not what the editor of the dictionary thinks is pretty or fun or less offensive but what his research has indicated as preferred by the greater number of influential writings of the time. There are a number of books like <em>Copy-editing</em>, usually called “style manuals” in the trade. The <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> is probably the best known in the US, and it is very good; but there are others, like <em>Words into Type</em>, that are also very good. <em>Copy-editing</em>, which could do with a more detailed index, earns high marks for the simplicity of its approach and the clarity and practicality of its suggestions.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
