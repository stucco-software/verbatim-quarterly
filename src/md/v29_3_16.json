ISO 9001—those who have been exposed to it will know; the rest of you can thank whatever you pray to that you have been spared.” To which Jane Cates, added,  “Oh fine then: Let's throw in the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model—dumbest thing ever to win the Nobel Prize for someone ….

It is only fair to say that the contempt with which Alice here dismisses an absurdity is balanced by a genuine appetite on the part of her real-life prototype, the “Secunda” who, as Carroll tells us in the dedicatory poem to <em>Alice's Adventures Underground</em> “In gentler tones … hopes/ 'There will be nonsense in it'” (ibid., p. 21). In fact, the second daughter of Henry George Liddell, dean of Christ Church College at Oxford—himself best known nowadays (at least to classics wonks) as half the authors of Liddell and Scott's <em>Greek Lexicon</em>—<em>was by no means atypical in her fondness for the preposterous. Deems Taylor, in his introduction to <em>The Complete Poems and Plays of W. S. Gilbert</em> (New York: Random House, 1931, p. xxv), writes that nonsense, especially in rhyme, has “always been the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon. Offer … entertainment whose chief excuse for being is its complete silliness, and he seizes it with a whole-souled delight that is likely to attract the perplexed stares of his Latin or Teutonic brothers. Particularly does he enjoy logical nonsense. Give him a completely ridiculous major premise, and develop it for him with perfect gravity and strict logic, and you make him very happy.” At no time was the thesis more sustainable then at the height of Victoria's reign, during which flourished Carroll, Gilbert, Edward Lear, and many others of lesser caliber. Two world wars may have somewhat curbed this robust appetite among the English, but such BBC series as <em>Benny Hill</em>,</em> <em>Blackadder</em>, and <em>Monty Python's Flying Circus</em> plainly show that it is by no means extinguished. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a2\">\n<p>The name of a county in North Carolina, whose representative in Congress (according to both <em>Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em> and the <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em>) excused an egregiously florid and impassioned speech he had just given with the rejoinder, “I was not speaking for the House, but for Buncombe.” (<em>Bunk</em> is unrelated to <em>bunco</em>, 'a swindle,' which is thought to come via Spanish <em>banca</em>, the name of a card game, from Italian <em>banca</em>, 'bank.') <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a2\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 2\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a3\">\n<p>A patent euphemism for <em>horseshit</em> (or its slightly politer variant, <em>horsepuckey</em>), <em>horsefeathers</em> agreeably replaces the profane with the preposterous: Horses are by definition featherless quadrupeds, with the exception of the mythical Pegasus, once familiar as the icon of Mobil gasoline stations. Pegasus and the autochthonous warrior Chrysaor were the offspring of Mother Earth when the blood of Medusa fell on the sand of the beach where she and her sisters had been sleeping. The winged steed thus forms an actual plot link between the suspiciously similar stories of gorgon-slaying Perseus and chimera-slaying Bellerophon. (See Graves, <em>The Greek Myths</em> (Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin, 1960), §§73 and 75.) A southeastern Pennsylvania informant, Estelle Elliott, uses the alliterative form <em>happy horseshit</em> when describing bureaucratic nonsense in particular, <em>happy</em> here meaning something closer to 'silly' than 'joyful.' <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a3\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 3\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a4\">\n<p>Most of the expressions in this article were responses to a request for synonyms posted early this fall to the Cafe Blue, an Internet newsgroup established a decade ago to discuss electronic publishing, and a spinoff of the still-flourishing e-zine <em>Blue Moon Review</em> (<a href=\"http://www.thebluemoon.com\">http://www.thebluemoon.com</a>). Admittedly this may be a more erudite set of speakers than a random sample of the population, but it seems not unlikely that even asking the first twenty people one met on the street would produce a list no less eclectic. Particular thanks are owed to respondents Bruce Harris Bentzman, Jane Cates, Ana Doina, David Graham, Harriet Green, Dwain and Jordanne Kitchell, Sherry Linn Kline, Chris Lott, Sally Russell, and Paul Sampson. Another indispensable source for this column has been the centenary edition of <em>Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em> (Ivor H. Evans, ed., New York: Harper and Row, 1981). <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a4\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 4\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a5\">\n<p>Philip Wheelwright writes that “the word <em>sophistês <em>is composed by adding to the word for wisdom [<em>sophia</em>] a suffix connoting a man who practices a profession, adding that for most Greeks it was “as meaningless to speak of an expert in wisdom as to speak of an expert in goodness. Nevertheless, Protagoras and his followers did in fact make this claim” (Wheelwright, <em>The Pre-Socratics</em>,</em> New York: Bobbs-Merrill/Odyssey, 1966, p. 236). Protagoras, who is nowadays best remembered for his aphorism “Man is the measure of all things,” maintained that our ability to acquire metaphysical knowledge was constrained in the end “by the obscurity of the matter and the brevity of human life” (ibid., p. 240), and hence that we ought to concentrate our inquiries instead on human affairs, particularly language. His followers became notorious teachers of rhetoric, and many became very wealthy, including both Protagoras himself and his equally famous colleague Gorgias: Wheelwright tells us that “the principal skill which the Sophists taught, and of which an ambitious Greek youth would be eager to acquire mastery, was the ability to win debates and to influence public opinion through the art of persuasive speech” (ibid., p. 238). Socrates was highly critical of this, and Plato frequently takes up the cudgel against the Sophists and their ethical pluralism on his old teacher's behalf (see especially his <em>Protagoras</em> and <em>Theaetatus.</em>) And indeed, it is the Sophists, not the Socratics, whom Aristophanes is actually lampooning in <em>The Clouds</em>:</em> His Socrates is a professional teacher of forensic oratory to whom a rather dim young man has come to learn how to win his pending lawsuit. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a5\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 5\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a6\">\n<p>Given currency by Shakespeare in <em>Julius Caesar</em> (Act 1, scene 2), in which Casca reports that a speech he had just heard Cicero give in the Forum at Rome was incomprehensible to him, having been entirely in Greek. This is the origin of the term <em>greeking</em> in page design, referring to blocks of meaningless body copy pasted up for position where the real copy is eventually to go. A favorite text, readily available on commercial Letraset, began “Lorem ipsum” which is of course fake Latin instead, a garbling of an actual Cicero passage beginning with the accusative case of the word for pain and suffering: “<em>Dolorem</em>.” Among sexual nonconformists, at least in the 1960s, the verb <em>to greek</em> had already come to mean 'to sodomize' (Michelle Grieves, personal communication, 1964). <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a6\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 6\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a7\">\n<p>The <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em> (hereinafter <em>AHD</em>) suggests that <em>gobbledigook</em> is imitative of the meaningless vocalizations of a turkey; interestingly, <em>to talk turkey</em> means 'to speak with candor' (see Urdang and LaRoche, <em>Picturesque Expressions: A Thematic Dictionary,</em> Chicago: Gale Research, 1980, p. 34, for a fanciful etymology). <em>AHD</em> lists the origin of the slur <em>gook</em> as unknown; might this have been a back-formation from [<em>speaker of</em>] <em>gobbledegook</em>? (The precedent of Latin <em>barbarus</em>, 'babbler,' whence English <em>barbarian</em> and <em>Berber</em>, springs to mind here.) However, there are two flaws in this argument, one phonetic—<em>gook</em> rhymes with <em>spook</em>, not <em>shook</em>—and the other historical: A poem from the last months o WW II's European theater (in a print source encountered some forty years ago whose author and title eludes recall) admonished GIs “Don't bunch up/You silly gookus:/They still have 88s/and Stukas,” the <em>88</em> (short for <em>Ju</em>[<em>nkers</em>]-<em>88</em>, and not to be confused in this context with the Allies' 88-mm antiaircraft gun) and the Ju-87 <em>Stuka</em> being two notorious types of German dive-bomber. (For a hair-raising WW II battle story with a bewildering inventory of aircraft on allsides, including both of the above, see Jim “Twitch” Tittle's “Gauntlet of Blood” (<a href=\"http://www.b-17combatcrewmen.org/GauntletofBlood.htm\">http://www.b-17combatcrewmen.org/GauntletofBlood.htm</a>). <em>Gookus</em> (plural and singular?) evidently meant 'idiot, dummy' (cf. <em>doofus</em>); a net search failed to retrieve either the poem or the term in this sense, but did turn the latter up as a synonym for 'gunk, glop' in several appliance-repair sites, e.g., “A sure indication was the brown junk/gookus leaking out of the rear bearing area and the belt has spewed it around in the drum” (<a href=\"http://www.applianceaid.com/frigidaire_frontload_washer.html\">http://www.applianceaid.com/frigidaire_frontload_washer.html</a>). <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a7\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 7\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a8\">\n<p>Surely an inspiration for George Orwell's Newspeak portmanteau word <em>doublethink</em> in the dystopia of <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> (1947), though he uses the term specifically to mean cognitive duplicity without dissonance. (Might this tidy dactylic neologism also have been suggested rhythmically by a chewing gum known on both sides of the Atlantic, Wrigley's <em>Doublemint</em>? By contrast, most compound phrases beginning with “double” have <em>two</em> stresses: <em>double dactyl</em>, <em>double Dutch</em>, <em>double indemnity</em>, <em>double or nothing</em>, <em>double-quick</em>, <em>double-tongued</em>, <em>double trouble</em>, and so on.) <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a8\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 8\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a9\">\n<p>Supposedly from <em>Hoc est corpus</em>, said by the priest consecrating the wafer during the Eucharist, <em>hocus pocus</em> was the start of a string of fake Latin reeled off by comics since at least the early 1600s (see <em>Brewer's</em>, p. 557; for more on reduplicative minimal pair expressions, see my “Baddabing, Baddabang,” VERBATIM XXVI/4 [Autumn 2001], pp. 19–22. Cf. also <em>mumbo-jumbo</em>, originally, according to <em>Brewer's</em> (p. 764), the name of an African bogy used by the men to intimidate women and children, and made famous in Vachel Lindsay's poem “The Congo.”) <em>All my eye and Betty Martin</em> has been ascribed to an English speaker's mishearing of an Italian beggar's exclamation <em>Alme ah beate Martine</em>! (Oh nurturant Saint Martin!)—Martin of Tours being a patron saint of mendicants—though <em>Picturesque Expressions</em> (p. 118) quotes and rejects a similar and even more implausible derivation, noting its attribution to the Joe Miller of the long-selling eponymous jest book. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a9\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 9\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a10\">\n<p><em>Blarney</em> refers to the gift of eloquence supposedly to be acquired without fail by kissing a famous stone in Blarney Castle, Ireland, so probably has one foot in our “empty rhetoric” category as well; <em>AHD</em> gives its first meaning as 'smooth, flattering talk,' and its second as 'deceptive nonsense.' As an undergraduate, Brian O'Nolan had published a newsletter entitled <em>Blather</em> before graduating to his column <em>Cruiskeen Lawn</em>, a regular feature in the <em>Irish Times</em> over the byline Myles na gCopaleen (Myles of the little horses), and writing several novels, including <em>At-Swim-Two Birds</em> and <em>The Third Policeman</em> under the pseudonym of Flann O'Brien. Variants of this word include <em>blether <em>and the participial <em>blithering</em>,</em> as in <em>a blithering idiot</em>. <em>AHD</em> derives it from Old Norse <em>bladhra</em>, 'to prattle' (for what it's worth, the Vikings frequently raided, and in some places settled, the Irish coast), related to English <em>bladder</em> and deriving from the Proto-Indo-European root <em>bhle-</em>,</em> meaning 'blow.' <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a10\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 10\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a11\">\n<p>Thus Sir John Harington, in his prologue to his <em>New Discourse of a Stale Subject, Called</em> t<em>he Metamorphosis of Ajax</em> (ed. Elizabeth Story Donno, New York: Columbia University Press, 1962), cites the phrase “bad skite upon Ajax” (p. 69), a <em>jax</em> (=<em>jakes</em>) being an archaic word for a privy. The Proto-Indo-European root of <em>shit</em> is <em>skeid</em>-, an extended form of <em>skei-</em>, 'cut, split,' also yielding English <em>skate</em> (in its sense of 'decrepit horse') and <em>shyster</em>. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a11\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 11\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a12\">\n<p>As can <em>shit</em> itself: <em>You're shitting me</em>! This is not to be confused with the “quasi-verb” <em>shit</em> [<em>on</em>], discussed at some length in James D. McCawley's mischievously seminal paper “English Sentences without Overt Grammatical Subject,” originally published in the journal <em>Languages</em> in 1968 under the pseudonym Quang Phoc Dong and reprinted as the leading article in the mock-festschrift <em>Studies out in Left Field</em> (Arnold M.

(Still in use today, it was certainly current by 1965, when an Indiana informant, Heather Hollingshead Oesting, reported that she had heard it often enough from her own father.) The -<em>ola</em> of <em>crapola</em> began as a diminutive suffix, derived from Latin -<em>ulus</em>/-<em>ula</em>/-<em>ulum</em> (as in <em>crustulum</em>, 'cookie, little cake,' or <em>gladiola</em>, 'flower that looks like a little sword [<em>gladius</em>]') but somehow became an amplifier instead: An affectionate nickname for large-nosed Jimmy Durante was <em>Schnozzola</em>. Again, <em>crapola</em> may also be related to the alliterative expression <em>doesn't know shit from Shinola</em>, Shinola having once been a widely marketed shoe polish. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a14\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 14\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a15\">\n<p>The bean as a unit of worthlessness appears in English at least as early as Chaucer (in a pretty poem beginning “Since I from Love escapéd am so fat/I never thought to be in his prison lean”), and <em>not worth a hill of beans</em> is still proverbial. One suspects, however, that there is more to it: It was the Roman custom for the paterfamilias to walk through the house throwing beans over his shoulder to propitiate the ancestral ghosts abroad during the two nights a year celebrated as the <em>Lemuria</em>; and Pythagoras enjoined his followers at Crotona to abstain from the eating of beans, later ironically making his escape by running through a bean field when the locals burned his cult's compound. It is quite possible that both practices arose from the sulfurous smell of flatulence being associated with corruption and decomposition. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a15\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 15\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a16\">\n<p>See note 13 above. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a16\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 16\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a17\">\n<p>In one of his early novels the Canadian writer Robertson Davies quotes a quatrain with this offending word as its truncated but obvious rhyme.
