From my British-American dictionary (No.\n21 on the VERBATIM Book Club list) I have culled some\nexamples, to which I must append some interpretation and\nexplanation, since very few Americans have the remotest\nnotion about cricket and its mystique, and analogies to baseball\nare treacherously misleading.  But let's try.</p>\n<p>1.  To <em>carry or carry out or bring out one's bat</em> is to 'stay\nwith it,' 'outlast the rest'—the exact nuance depending upon\nthe context.  This expression applies to the batsman (batter)\nwho is not put out during the match while his teammates\nfall by the wayside, and therefore leaves the pitch ('field')\nonly at the end of his side's innings (yes, it has an -<em>s</em> in the\nsingular: an innings is 'the period of play during which a\nside is <em>in</em> [or <em>up</em>]') carrying his bat with him, instead of leaving\nit for the next batsman, as used to be done in former\ntimes before everybody could afford his own bat.  His ten\nteammates are all out; thus he has 'stayed with it' and 'outlasted'\nthem.</p>\n<p>2.  To do something <em>off one's own bat</em> is to do it 'on one's\nown.'</p>\n<p>3.  To <em>get a duck</em> or <em>be out for a duck</em> is to 'fall flat on\none's face,' to 'fizzle.'  <em>Duck</em>, in this idiom is short for <em>duck's\negg</em>, a British variant of <em>goose egg</em>, meaning 'zero' (or <em>nil</em>, as\nthe British prefer to express it in scoring).  Thus, a batsman\nwho is out without scoring a single run is said to <em>get</em> or <em>be\nout for a duck</em>.</p>\n<p>4.  If one gets a duck in both innings (in first class, or\nmajor league, cricket, each side has two innings) one <em>bags a\nbrace</em>.  The term is used to describe a 'double fizzle,' as it\nwere.  You fall on your face, get up, and do it again.</p>\n<p>5.  A batsman who makes his first run is said to have\n<em>broken his duck</em>.  Hence to <em>break one's duck</em> is to have 'broken\nthe ice,' 'made a start' and to 'be on one's way.'</p>\n<p>6.  To <em>have a good innings</em> is to 'have a good long life.'\n<em>Innings</em> is used metaphorically, like <em>inning</em> in America, to\nmean a 'turn,' an opportunity to accomplish an objective.\n<em>Innings</em> applies especially to a political party's period of dominance,\nor the term of a jobholder generally.  But in context,\na <em>good innings</em> means a 'life that is satisfying in both length\nand accomplishment.'</p>\n<p>7.  To <em>hit</em> (or <em>knock) someone for six</em> is to 'knock him for\na loop,' 'knock the daylights out him.'  In cricket, a ball hit\nbeyond the boundary (roughly equivalent to <em>into the stands</em>)\nscores six runs, and a six is analogous to a 'homer.'</p>\n<p>8.  A <em>maiden over</em> is a bowler's achievement.  He bowls\n(pitches) six balls, and that constitutes an <em>over</em>.  If he can do\nthis without allowing any runs, this is called a <em>maiden over</em>\n(a curious reference to virginity).  Metaphorically, then, a\n<em>maiden over</em> is a 'successful ordeal,' one through which the\nprotagonist has emerged unscathed.</p>\n<p>9.  To <em>queer the pitch</em> is to 'queer the act,' 'spoil some-one's\nchances,' 'gum up the works,' 'throw a monkey wrench\ninto the machinery' (or, as the British say, <em>a spanner into\nthe works</em>).</p>\n<p>10.  To <em>be on a good wicket</em> is, like <em>being on a good pitch</em>,\nto 'be in a good spot.'  To <em>be on a good wicket</em> with someone\nis to 'be in favor' with him.  To <em>be</em> (or <em>bat</em>) <em>on a sticky wicket</em>\nis to be in a bad situation.  <em>Wicket</em> has come to mean 'situation'\ngenerally.  Thus, the newspapers spoke of the “American\nwicket in Vietnam.”</p>\n<p>11.  To <em>up</em> or <em>draw stumps</em> is to 'pull up stakes,' 'clear\nout.'  The stumps are the three upright sticks which form part\nof a wicket (here <em>wicket</em> means something else again) which\nthe bowler tries to break each time he bowls, and any fielder\nwith the ball in his hand can aim at as well while the batsman\nis running, in order to score an out.  When the match is\nover, the stumps are pulled out of the ground and everybody\ngoes home.</p>\n<p>12.  <em>At close of play</em> means (referring to anything) 'at\nthe end of the day.'</p>\n<p>13.  <em>To play a straight bat</em> (considered correct form) is\nto 'play fair'—the very essence of cricket.  Which leads to...</p>\n<p>14.  <em>It isn't cricket</em>, a sentence and a sentiment with which\nI'm sure we are all familiar.</p>\n<p>Much of the above may be confusing, but space does\nnot permit a dissertation on cricket—a game, a way of life,\na religion.  Suffice it to say that in Britain as well as in America,\nthe national sport has been a fecund source of colloquialisms\nfound in the everyday language of those who may never have\nattended a match.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
