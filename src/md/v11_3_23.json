Godinez</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">New York, New York</span></em></p>\n<p>The language of the Vikings has long been underrated as an\ninfluence on the English language.  Hartvig Dahl's <em>Word\nFrequencies of Spoken American English</em> counts five words of\nOld Norse (ON) origin among the hundred most common\nwords uttered by Americans: possibly <em>like; get, want, they</em>, and\n<em>them</em>.  Latin-Old French, understandably touted as a far richer\nsource, counts but six words in the same range: <em>just, because,\nreally</em>, possibly <em>mean; very</em>, and <em>sort</em>.  Latin-Old French ultimately\nhas the numbers, but ON has the depth.  Rarely does a\nlanguage borrow pronouns, since they're part of the bedrock of\na language; yet the ON borrowings <em>they, them</em>, and <em>their</em>\nsuggest the powerful influence of the Scandinavians on Old\nEnglish-speaking (OE) people.  They also help when you want\nto impress your friends by formulating sentences almost totally\nborrowed from Scandinavian sources such as, “They got\nsnagged,” or “Like die, scrub,” or “Their sister reeks\nwhoredom!”</p>\n<p>This essay discusses a few semantic categories of ON\nwords that exist in Modern English (E).  Each category includes\nthe dialect words often unmentioned in similar treatments by\nhistory-of-English type books.  All words have an ON etymon\nunless otherwise indicated as Scandinavian (Scand).  This means\nthe word seems to have an etymon or cognate in one of the five\nScand languages (Icelandic, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, or\nFaroese), but no attested form has yet been found in ON.\nWords are glossed when I feel the precise meaning is especially\ninteresting.</p>\n<p>A for animals is a good place to start.  The Vikings were\nnot prigs, and things porcine must have been important to\nthem: <em>galt, gilt</em> 'young sow,' <em>grice, griskin</em>, and possibly <em>hog</em>.\nSheep terms are <em>gimmer, hirsel</em>, and <em>blissom</em> 'concerning ewe;\nin heat', a blossoming bliss of sorts.  Cattle terms: <em>bull, quey</em>\n'heifer,' akin to E <em>cow</em>, and <em>nowt</em> with variant <em>nolt</em> 'cattle,' akin\nto E <em>neat</em> 'ox'.  Two deer terms are possibly <em>elk</em>; and <em>rein(deer)</em>;\ndogs: <em>cur, Dane</em>, and <em>sleuth</em>, originally 'animal track' and later\n'bloodhound'; horses: <em>filly</em> and perhaps <em>jade</em> 'worn-out horse'\nand <em>yaud</em> 'whore; mare', the latter two words maybe ultimately\nfrom Finnish.  Animals that annoy: insects as <em>clegg</em> 'horsefly,'\nScand <em>lop</em> 'flea'; <em>mawk</em> 'maggot,' and <em>maggot</em> itself; rodents as\n<em>vole(mouse)</em> and Scand <em>lemming</em>.  Some miscellaneous animals:\nScand <em>bat; hagworm</em>, possibly <em>kid</em>, possibly <em>scut</em> 'hare'; <em>walrus</em>,\nand <em>pad(dock)</em> 'toad' from which <em>padlock</em> may have been\nformed due to a supposed similarity to the shape of the toad.\nOdd terms number <em>brisket</em> 'animal breast,' <em>kitling</em> 'young of an\nanimal; kitten', <em>scrag</em> 'lean person or animal,' and <em>tyke</em>, originally\n'dog'—ON <em>tik</em> 'bitch.'</p>\n<p>Birds figure heavily in ON borrowings.  Geese alone\nnumber several terms: <em>brant, ember(goose), gosling, goosander,\ngull</em> (not the sea bird, which is from Welsh), and <em>solan</em>.  Only a\nfew bird terms are commonly known: <em>auk, (corn) crake, dove</em>.\nThe rest are generally known only by specialists: <em>cadder</em> and\nrelated <em>kae; fulmar</em> and related <em>maw</em>, akin to E <em>mew; gare-fowl</em>\nand possibly related <em>gyrfalcon; gowk</em> which superseded OE\n<em>géac</em> 'cuckoo'&gt;obsolete (obs) E <em>yeke</em>; the related <em>loom</em> and\n<em>loon</em>, the related <em>scarf</em> and <em>scart; scua, steg</em>, and <em>tern</em>.  A few\nmiscellaneous terms: <em>down</em> 'feathering,' <em>egg</em> 'ovum' (although\n<em>egg</em> 'to incite' is indeed another Norse borrowing), <em>laughter</em>\n'number of eggs laid by a fowl,' and <em>wing</em>, cherished by Paul\nMcCartney.</p>\n<p>Just as many of the birds above are sea-related, the\nNorsemen, and presumably Norsewomen, were also interested\nin what lived below the surface: <em>bloat(er)</em>, Scand <em>brisling;\nflounder, hake</em>, the whales <em>narwhale</em> (formed on ON <em>nár</em>\n'corpse' with reference to the mammal's skin) and <em>rorqual;\nsaithe</em>, Scand <em>scrabe; scrae, sile, skate</em>, possibly <em>skelly; torsk</em> and\nrelated <em>tusk</em> and <em>cusk; turbot</em>.  Some miscellaneous terms: <em>gill,\nrip</em> 'wicker basket for fish,' <em>roe</em> 'spawn of fish.'</p>\n<p>The popular image of the Vikings is far from that of flower\nchildren, yet borrowed flora terms abound.  Plants include\n<em>bur(r)</em>, later 'obstacle in the throat' and possibly even later\n'uvular pronunciation of /r/'; <em>burdock</em>, formed on <em>bur(r)</em>; <em>carl\nhemp</em>, Scand <em>golland</em> and variant <em>gowan</em>, possibly akin to E\n<em>gold; hulver, ling, seal</em> 'willow,' and <em>seave</em> 'the rush.'  The\n<em>dahlia</em> is eponymous for the Swedish botanist A. Dahl.  Vegetables\ncount <em>cole, collard, kale</em>, all 'cabbage' and preserved in\n<em>kailyard</em> 'cabbage garden,' symbolic of Scotland's literature\nsince 1895 as in “the kailyard school”; <em>rutabaga</em> 'turnip,'\nliterally, 'root-bag'; and <em>skirret</em> 'parsnip,' literally, 'sheer-white.'\nVarious grasses are Scand <em>fog</em> (and later perhaps <em>foggy</em> 'misty'\nand by backformation <em>fog</em> 'mist'), <em>marram</em>, literally, 'mere\n[“sea”] haulm'; Scand <em>s(a) ennegrass, tang</em>, and <em>varech</em>, akin to\nE <em>wreck</em>; star 'grass' (the Norse heavenly body is preserved in\n<em>stern, starn</em>), and <em>tangle</em>.  Shrubs: <em>busk</em> and adjectival <em>bosky;\nrest-harrow, rone</em>, and Scand <em>whin</em>.  Trees: possibly <em>fir</em>; and\nScand <em>rowan</em>.  Grains: <em>big(g)</em> 'type of barley,' akin to OE <em>béow</em>\n'grain'; and <em>skeg</em>, akin to E <em>shaw</em> 'thicket; surname,' E <em>shag</em>\n'rough hair,' and <em>skaw</em>, itself from ON meaning 'promontory.'\nFruit: only the Scand <em>bilberry</em>.  Various items concerning parts\nof a tree, plant, or hedge are <em>awn, bark, blea, bole, root, sway</em>,\npossibly Scand <em>log</em>; and <em>trouse</em>.  Scand <em>trash</em> originally meant\n'broken twigs.'</p>\n<p>Most of the terms inherited from Old Norse referring to\nhuman beings are disparaging.  The etymological fallacy is\nbelied by <em>cheapskate</em>, literally 'cheap shit.'  The second element\nis preserved in <em>blatherskate, blatherskite</em> 'talkative person' and\nunbounded in <em>skate</em> 'contemptible person' and <em>skite</em> 'to\nexcrete.'  (One cannot overlook the important frequentatives\n<em>skitter</em> and probable variant <em>squitter</em> 'to void thin excrement.')\nFor a quick put-down try: <em>duffer</em> 'incompetent person,' akin to\nE <em>deaf; fry</em> 'unimportant person,' which I've never heard\nunchaperoned by E <em>small</em>, maybe redundant to purists since\nthe etymon for <em>fry</em> meant <em>seed; gowk</em> 'fool' (also 'bird': see\nabove); <em>hobo</em>, perhaps as Professor E. Fichtner has suggested,\nfrom ON <em>haugbúi</em> 'ghost, “undead” man,' formed on <em>haugr</em> 'a\nhow, a hill' + <em>bua</em> 'to dwell'; <em>kid</em>, originally 'young of goat';\n<em>nithing</em> 'a wretch' and variants <em>nidder(l)ing</em> 'a coward; cowardly';\n<em>oaf</em>, surprisingly akin to and originally meaning E '<em>elf;\noutlaw; runagate</em> 'apostate, deserter' with second element\nformed on <em>gate</em> 'way; street; manner of going' with variant <em>gait</em>\n'manner of walking'; possibly <em>scout</em> and variant <em>scut</em> 'contemptible\nperson'; possibly <em>scrub</em> 'mean little fellow; low stunted\ntree,' although I've heard this word used only to describe\ninferior athletes; Scand <em>slouk</em> and possible variant <em>slouch</em>\n'ungainly fellow,' the latter also 'stooping posture'; <em>snob</em>,\noriginally 'shoemaker('s apprentice); townsman'; <em>steg</em> 'stupid\nperson' (also 'bird': see above); <em>swain</em>, also preserved in\n<em>boatswain</em> and <em>coxswain</em>; and <em>thrall</em>.  The Norsemen were\napparently as sexist as we are: all of the following, <em>flag, giglet,\ngimmer, skit</em>, and <em>slattern</em> generally mean 'low, contemptible\nwoman'; only <em>may</em> 'maiden' has survived with specific reference\nto women without pejoration.  Other words without\nnecessary pejoration: <em>fellow</em>, literally 'fee-layer'; <em>guest</em>, replacing\nOE <em>g(i)est</em>; and <em>ombudsman</em>.  A surprising number of words\nhave endured indicating familial relationship: <em>bairn</em> 'child,'\n<em>fore-elders, forefather, friend</em> 'kinsman', <em>half-brother/sister, sister</em>\nitself, replacing cognates of OE <em>sweostor</em>; and <em>husband</em> with\nvariant <em>hubby</em>, the latter preferred in huge headlines of\nsensationalistic newspapers.  The <em>in-law</em> hyphemes are partially\nNorse since <em>law</em> is directly from ON superseding OE <em>æ</em> 'law.'  A\nfew historical terms: <em>hold</em> 'high-ranking officer in the Danelaw,'\n<em>housecarl</em> 'bodyguard of a king or noble,' <em>jarl</em> 'chieftain of\nancient Scandinavia.'  Personal names, almost all compounds,\ninclude <em>Eric</em>, literally 'honor-great'; <em>Harold</em> 'army-wielder';\n<em>Ingrid</em> 'Ingvi (“a Germanic god”)-ride'; <em>Leif</em>, akin to E <em>lief</em> and\nE <em>love; Ralph</em> 'counsel-wolf'; <em>Ronald</em> 'decreeing powers-ruler';\npartially <em>Sigmund</em> 'victory-hand'; and presumably <em>Thurston</em>\n'Thor-stone.' A few other proper names: <em>Norman</em>, literally\n'north-man'; <em>Varangian</em> “Scandinavian rover over Russia'; and—\nwhat else?—probably <em>Viking</em>.</p>\n<p>And what did the Vikings like to do?  Well, some scholars\nclaim the Norse got a raw deal and were ultimately scholarly\nfarmers.  But their linguistic legacy in English sometimes seems\notherwise: they apparently liked to <em>bang, bash, baste</em> (and <em>lam</em>\nand <em>lambaste</em>, of course), <em>berry</em> 'to hit,' <em>ding</em> with\n(re)duplicative <em>ding-dong, dint</em> (verb only), <em>hit, nevel</em> 'to\npunch,' <em>scrap, scuff, slam, slat</em> 'to strike; to cast,' sometimes\n<em>slaughter</em>, but sometimes only <em>tip</em>.  Scandinavian words include\n<em>bump, cuff</em> (also in <em>fisticuffs)</em>, <em>rap, slug</em>, and <em>whither</em> 'to strike\nviolently.'</p>\n<p>Can the savage words above be counterbalanced by\nperhaps the most beautiful relic of Old Norse: <em>hug</em>?</p>\n<h2></h2>",
