To some extent, those\nfamiliar with the writings of certain authors may be able\nto say, “That sounds like Milton,” or, “I can't imagine\nthat Swift wrote anything like that!”  The use of computer-generated\nconcordances coupled with grammatical and\nsyntactic analyses developed by linguists concerned with\nstylistics provides a systematized procedure for doing much\nthe same thing.</p>\n<p>Again, the linguist specializing in the history of the\nlanguage can easily trace a given lexical item with the\nhelp of a concordance or a series of concordances, for the\ncompared rank frequency of a word in a variety of concordances\ncan yield considerable information about its\nhistory.</p>\n<p>The work at hand, an impressive, two-volume concordance\nbased on the Twickenham edition of Pope's\npoems, lists 20,892 words that are illustrated by 269,625\nlines of text.  In the Appendix are set forth a clear statistical\nsummary derived from the analysis of the completed\nconcordance, a list of words in (descending) order of frequency,\nand the distribution and type/token ratios in the\nentire work.  [<em>Type</em> means an individual word; <em>token</em> means\nthe total number of occurrences of that word.  The ratios\nbetween them (<em>type/token ratios</em>) reveal important information\nabout the way the language is used by a given\nauthor.]  The first volume contains an alphabetical list\nshowing the frequency of each word in the poems of Pope,\nfollowed by the main concordance, which lists under each\nof the alphabetized headwords the lines (indexed) illustrating\nall of the instances of the use of the headword.  In\nkeeping with common practice, the words of extraordinarily\nhigh frequency (like <em>a, and, but, the</em>, etc.), although\ncounted, are not illustrated.</p>\n<p>All this is more or less standard among modern concordances,\nbut that in no way diminishes the value of the\npresent work.  In fact, the more concordances made available\nto scholars, the more useful comparisons among them\nbecome, adding immeasurably to our continually expanding\nknowledge of something we all use in all our activities\nalmost every day of our lives but of which we still know\nso little--language.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
