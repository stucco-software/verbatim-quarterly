Tius</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Kavala, Greece</span></em></p>\n<p>Until the late 1960s the identity of Soma, the\ninspiration for the Rig Veda, had been one of the\nmost intriguing and intractable problems of Vedic scholarship.\nThe hymns to Soma date back more than 3,000\nyears and were composed in Vedic, the parent-language\nof Sanskrit, by the poets or priests of the Aryan peoples\nwho invaded the Indus Valley region.  These invaders\nwere cattle-breeders and grain-growers with elaborate\nmyths and a tribal religion rich in ritual and served by\nan hereditary priesthood.  Around 1000 B.C. the Vedic\nhymns, composed in widely separated regions over a\nperiod of 500 years or more, were gathered together and\nthe canon was then closed.  The text of that canon has,\nmiraculously, come down to us intact.  In their pantheon\nof gods were, among many others, Indra, god of the\nthunderbolt; Agni, god of fire; Parjanya, god of thunder\nand, according to one tradition, the father of Soma.\nSoma, too, was a god—a god and an inebriant; a plant\nand the juice of that plant.  But what plant?  Our only\nsource of information on the subject is the Rig Veda,\n1,028 hymns, of which 120 are entirely devoted to Soma.\nYet, for 2,500 years, the identity of Soma was unknown.</p>\n<p>Even before 1000 B.C., Soma substitutes were being\nused in the rituals, which indicated a breakdown in the\nlines of communication between the scattered invaders\nand their source of supply in the Himalayan Mountains\n(for Soma grew only in the mountains).  This use of\nsubstitutes complicated the problem of identifying\nSoma.  There were other complications, too.  Inevitably,\nnames for plants familiar to the invaders in their distant\nhomeland would in the new environment be bestowed\nupon other plants which resembled them in some way.\nIn addition, generic terms for flower, herb, tree, etc.\nmay well have been based on a system of classification\ndifferent from our own post-Linnaean one.  Nevertheless,\nthe descriptions of Soma, though couched in poetic\nlanguage full of metaphor and almost deliriously lyrical,\nwere as precise as they were varied.  In the past 200\nyears, since Western countries have discovered the\nlanguages and cultures of their Sanskrit and Vedic\nrelatives, many plants—from hemp and henbane to rhubarb—were\nproposed as likely Soma-candidates, but\nnone finally passed the test of congruence with the\ndescriptions in the Vedic hymns.</p>\n<p>In 1968 that situation changed, with the publication\nof R. Gordon Wasson's <em>Soma, Divine Mushroom of\nImmortality.</em>  This book was the outgrowth of an earlier\nbook, itself the fruit of many years of research conducted\nby its authors, R. Gordon Wasson and his wife,\nValentina Pavlovna Wasson.  The origin of the epic\nsearch, which neither of the Wassons had forseen might\nlead to Soma, is best told in Mr. Wasson's own words.\nThe search began in</p>\n<p>... August 1927 (when) my bride, as she then was,\nand I took our delayed honeymoon ... in the\nCatskills.  She was a Russian born in Moscow ...\n(and) had fled from Russia with her family in the\nsummer of 1918, she being then 17 years old.  She\nqualified as a physician at the University of London\nand had been working hard to establish her\npediatric practice in New York.  I was a newspaper\nman in the financial department of the <em>Herald\nTribune.</em>  On that first beautiful afternoon of our\nholiday in the Catskills, we went sauntering down\nthe path for a walk.  ... Suddenly Tina threw down\nmy hand and darted up into the forest.  She had\nseen mushrooms....  She cried out in delight at\ntheir beauty....  Such a display she had not seen\nsince she left her family's dacha near Moscow,\nalmost a decade before....  She began gathering\nsome of the fungi in her apron....  That evening\nshe seasoned the soup with fungi, she garnished\nthe meat with other fungi....  I ate nothing with\nmushrooms in it.  Frantic and deeply hurt, I was led\nto wild ideas: I told her I would wake up a\nwidower.</p>\n<p>She proved right and I wrong.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... A little thing ... this difference in emotional\nattitude toward wild mushrooms.  But my wife and I\ndid not think so, and we devoted most of our\nlecture hours for decades to dissecting it, defining\nit, and tracing it to its origins.</p>\n<p>—<em>The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries</em>, by R. Gordon</p>\n<p>Wasson, Carl A.P. Ruck and Albert<br>\nHofmann, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich,<br>\nNew York and London, 1978, pp. 13-17.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some thirty years later, in May 1957, only seven\nmonths before Mrs. Wasson's death, the results of their\nyears of patient research were made known in <em>Mushrooms,\nRussia and History</em> (Pantheon Books, New York).\nThe woodland path they took that day in August 1927\nhad led them by winding trails to distant parts of the\nworld and to the beginnings of civilization in prehistoric\ntimes.  In the process of delineating the gap separating\ntheir two peoples, a gap which divides all Indo-European\npeoples into two camps, mycophiles and\nmycophobes (words of the Wassons' coining), they had\nrediscovered the role of the hallucinogenic mushrooms\nof Mexico in religious rites being performed there today\nas they had been for centuries before the Spanish\nConquest.  The Wassons had also glimpsed</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a period long ago before our ancestors knew how to\nwrite, when those ancestors must have regarded a\nmushroom as a divinity or quasi-divinity ...\nevoking awe and admiration, fear, yes, even terror.\nWhen that early cult gave way to new religions and\nto novel ways emerging with a literate culture, the\nemotions aroused by the old cult would survive....\nIn one area the fear and terror would live on,\neither of a particular mushroom (as in the case of\n<em>Amanita muscaria</em>); or else, as the emotional focus\nthrough tabu became vague, of “toadstools” in\ngeneral; and in another area, for a reason that we\ncannot now tell, it was the spirit of love and\nadoration that survived.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That first great pioneering work had opened up a new\nfield of study to which the Wassons gave the name\nethno-mycology (a branch of ethnobotany).  Eventually it\nalso led to Mr. Wasson's inspired unraveling of the\nSoma mystery.</p>\n<p>The winding trail to Soma leads back to the Tree of\nLife and the Herb of Immortality, central images in\nfolklore from China to the Near East.  For Siberian\npeoples, the Tree of Life was the white birch.  Was it\nonly coincidence that the fly agaric, <em>Amanita muscaria,</em>\nthe Sacred Element in the shamanistic rites of Siberian\ntribes (such as the Koryaks, Voguls, et al.), will grow\nonly where the white birch—and the pine and fir—can\ngrow?  European mycologists learned of the mycorrhizal\nassociation of the fly agaric and the birch, pine, and fir\nonly in 1885, but the native peoples of Siberia must\nhave observed the fact thousands of years before.  There\nis linguistic evidence for use of the fly agaric dating\nback to the period when a common Uralic language was\nspoken, before its division into the Samoyed and Finno-Ugrian\nlanguages.  According to some linguists, Uralic\nceased to be spoken around 6000 B.C.; according to\nothers, around 4000 B.C.</p>\n<p>Another fungal growth is associated with the white\nbirch: <em>Fomes fomentarius,</em> the bracket or shelf fungus\nused as punk, tinder, touchwood, wick for thousands of\nyears, perhaps even before 10,000 B.C. (Remains of punk\nstill attached to birchwood have been found in the\nexcavations of Star Carr in Yorkshire.)  White birch, fiery\nred fly agaric with its striking white “warts” or speckles,\nand the fire-catching punk formed a trio: Tree of Life,\nlight for the soul, heat for the body.  At the roots of the\nTree of Life, say the legends, lies a snake—a chthonic\nspirit like the Delphic Python, the toad (which elsewhere,\nas in England, became associated with all mushrooms\nand with the fly agaric in particular), and\nmushrooms themselves.  In the topmost branches of the\nTree is a bird—the “Bird of Paradise.”</p>\n<p>But why “fly”-agaric?  The connection between flies\nand madness must have seemed obvious to a herdsman,\nfor when botflies lay their eggs in an animal's nostrils, it\nbecomes frantic until the larvae mature and desert their\nhost.  Such English expressions as <em>bats (bots) in the\nbelfry, a bee in one's bonnet, bughouse, a flea in one's\near,</em> and others are vestigial remains of the belief that\ninsects, flies especially, cause insanity.  Flies are also\nassociated with A.  <em>muscaria</em> because of the (perhaps\ntabu-induced) belief common among Slavic and most\nGermanic peoples, as well as in certain parts of France\n(Fr. <em>tue-mouche</em> 'kill-fly,' <em>'A. muscaria'</em>), that flies die\nafter eating it.  This is not strictly true, though a fly may\nbe stupefied by the ibotenic acid contained in <em>A. muscaria</em>\nand may then die by “misadventure.”</p>\n<p>Gk. <em>myxa</em> (cognate with Gk. <em>mykés</em> 'mushroom')\nmeans both 'nasal mucus' and 'lampwick.'  There may be\ntwo reasons for this: first, a fresh mushroom when\ncrushed or pressed becomes a soft mucoid mass; the\nsecond could be an ancient connection between <em>Fomes\nfomentarius</em> and the fly agaric, which, if improperly\nprepared and then ingested, might lead to the same sort\nof frenzied, hyperactive behavior observed in botfly-infested\nanimals.  For many primitive peoples there was\nalso a connection between the creation of fire and sexual\nprocreation, and in some languages, e.g., Greek and\nJapanese, the word for mushroom can also mean penis\n(the phallic shape of the emerging mushroom may also\nbe partly responsible for this usage); in the same way in\nEnglish, <em>flame, punk,</em> and <em>spark</em> have erotic\nconnotations.</p>\n<p>So, too, with <em>mouse,</em> which in German as in English\nmay mean 'mistress.'  Mice and insects tend to appear in\nsudden swarms, and mice, like insects that metamorphose\nfrom one “life” to a different one, belong to two\nworlds: living some of the time underground, they\nappeared to be messengers from the netherworld—\nchthonic spirits, like mushrooms.  There seems to be an\netymological connection between Latin and Greek for\nfly and mouse: Lat. musca, N. Gk. <em>myga</em>, Gk. <em>myia</em> 'fly';\nGk. <em>mygalē</em> 'shrewmouse'; Lat. <em>mus</em>, Skt. <em>mus</em>, Gk. <em>mys</em>\n'mouse, muscle.'  And in Turkish, keme 'truffle, fungus,\nrat'; Fr. '<em>rat</em> rat; whimsy, maggot; taper.'</p>\n<p>Whoever reads any of the Wasson studies is likely\nto find himself thinking of the ancient mushroom-cult\nconnotations when he reads certain words, such as\n<em>bang, bogey, bot, botch, bug, dole, fly, fungus, funk,\ngrub, mad, maggot, match, moth, mouse, mucus, pink,\npunk, speckle, sponge, spunk, string, tick, urine, wick</em>.\nBut words and expressions with mushroom-cult links are\nfound not just in Indo-European languages but in many\nUral-Altaic ones, such as Magyar (Hungarian), Mordvin,\nSelkup, and (as I think) Turkish.  They may even be,\nthough Mr. Wasson makes no such claim, worldwide;\nfor when we consider the <em>maggot-match-mucus</em> complex\nand look beyond (Indo-) Europe, we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Malay <em>amok</em> 'furious attack'<br>\nVirginia Algonkin <em>attamusco</em> 'it is red'<br>\n(Sp. fr.) Taino <em>maguey</em> an agave, source of pulque<br>\nNahuatl <em>malacatl</em> 'spindle'<br>\n(nat. name in) Yucatán <em>max</em> 'weevil'<br>\nNahuatl <em>mecatl</em> 'rope'<br>\nNahuatl <em>mexcalli</em> 'mescal'<br>\nGullah <em>moco</em> 'magic'<br>\nTupi <em>moco</em> 'mouse'<br>\nFula <em>moco'o</em> 'medicine man'<br>\nJap. <em>mogusa</em> 'moxa'<br>\nMass.

A\nfew of them are</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>ben</em> 'freckle, spot, bait'<br>\n<em>bendetmek</em> 'to bind, fascinate'<br>\n<em>bengi</em> 'immortal'<br>\n<em>benk</em> 'henbane, bhang'<br>\n<em>baği</em> 'magic'<br>\n<em>böcek</em> 'bug'<br>\n<em>böğ</em> 'poisonous spider'<br>\n<em>büvelik, büye, büyelik</em> 'bot'<br>\n<em>büyü</em> 'sorcery'<br>\n<em>odlubağa</em> 'toad' (O.
