Some animals\nare named from a comparison to another animal.\n<em>Aardvark</em> was borrowed from Afrikaans <em>aard</em> 'earth'\nplus <em>vark</em> 'pig,' the similarity being the snouts.  <em>Alligator</em>\nis from Spanish <em>el lagarto</em> 'the lizard,' since the\ngeneral configuration of both reptiles is horizontal.\n<em>Chameleon</em> originated as Greek <em>chamaí</em>' on the\nground' plus <em>léoacute;n</em>,' 'lion,' from the shape of the animal's\nmanelike head.  <em>Hippopotamus</em>, from Greek, is\na 'horse that swims in a river.'  <em>Porcupine</em>, from\nLatin, is a 'pig with thorns.'</p>\n<p>The metaphor in <em>canary</em> is senseless, though,\nbecause the word is actually a misnomer.  The\nFrench <em>canarie</em> designated the principal isle of the\ngroups of islands.  The word had come through Spanish\n<em>Canaria</em>, originating as Latin <em>Canāria Insula</em> 'Isle\nof the Dogs.'  Early explorers on the islands found\ngreat numbers of large dogs there and named the\narchipelago after them, from the Latin <em>canis</em> 'dog.'\nLater, there came to be a demand for the birds as\npets.  They were called canaries, and the dogs were\nsoon forgotten.</p>\n<p>Original animal metaphors are all but obliterated\nin words that have no reference to animals.  An\n<em>asinine</em>, human action is the one only an ass should\ncommit, since <em>ass</em> 'animal known for its stupidity' is\nbased on Latin <em>asinus</em> 'ass.'  To play a bugle is to\nblow on the horn of a wild ox, through Old French\n<em>bugle</em>, from Latin <em>bōs</em> 'ox.'  <em>Butter</em> hides the Greek\n<em>boûs</em> 'ox' plus <em>t\\?\\rós</em> 'cheese.'  A <em>canard</em> is a false story\nfabricated to deceive.  The lost metaphor in <em>canard</em>\nis a duck, from a French expression <em>vendre un canard\ná moitié</em> 'to half-sell a duck.'  To half-sell anything is\nnot to sell it at all, but to make it seem as if it had\nbeen sold, that is, 'to deceive.'</p>\n<p>From Greek <em>kónōps</em> 'mosquito' the Romans\nformed <em>conopium</em> 'couch with a net' (to keep mosquitoes\naway).  The <em>canopy</em> used as an elegant covering\nover a modern bed, then, is a metaphoric net to\nkeep the lowly mosquito at a distance.  The ultimate\norigin of the word is an Egyptian town <em>Canopus</em>, evidently\nwell known for the notorious insect.  <em>Caper</em> is\nfrom Italian <em>capriolo</em> 'male roe deer.'  One who capers\naround is likened to leaping like a deer.  A <em>cavalier</em>\nis tied to his steed through Latin <em>caballus</em>\n'horse.'  <em>Chenille</em> was so called from its comparison\nto a hairy caterpillar, from the fabric's hairy texture.\nThe ultimate origin of the word is Latin <em>canis</em> 'dog.'\nThe forgotten animal in <em>columbine</em> is a dove, from\nLatin <em>columba</em>.  The flower of the plant resembles a\ncluster of five doves.  The original <em>cynics</em> were Greek\nphilosophers who made fun of wealth.  Their name\ncame from <em>kýōn</em>, a Greek word meaning 'dog.'  Most\ncynics actually lived barely better than dogs.</p>\n<p>The animal completing the metaphor in <em>dandelion</em>\nis a lion.  It was the French who established the\ncomparison in <em>dent de lion</em> 'tooth of a lion,' from the\ntooth-shaped leaves of the plant.  <em>Easel</em> was borrowed\nfrom Dutch <em>ezel</em> 'ass.'  The artist's easel supports\nhis canvas in the manner an ass carries a traveler's\nbelongings on his back.  <em>Gossamer</em> is a collection\nof weblike material seen floating through the\nair in autumn.  <em>Gossamer</em> was formed from early\nEnglish <em>gōs</em> 'goose' plus <em>summer</em> 'summer.'  The reference\nis either to the similiarity of drifting goose\nfeathers or to the time of year when geese begin to\nmigrate.  Latin <em>mūs</em> 'mouse' is the origin of <em>muscle</em>\nThe association is due to some muscles' shapes being\nsimilar to that of a mouse.  Also, the movement of a\nflexed muscle was thought to resemble the creeping\nof a mouse.</p>\n<p>The animal in hiding in <em>pavilion</em> is a butterfly,\nfrom Latin <em>papilionem</em> 'butterfly.'  Early pavilions\nwere tents, which were shaped like the spread wings\nof the butterfly.  Today's doctors' pavilion is far removed\nfrom a tent.  <em>Pedigree</em> completes its metaphor\nwith the Old French <em>pied de grue</em> 'crane's foot,' the\nthree-branched print of the foot of a crane being\nsimilar to the lines showing ancestry on a genealogical\nchart.  <em>Porcelain</em> was borrowed from Italian\n<em>porcelaine</em> 'cowrie shell,' from a similarity of the surfaces\nof each.  The origin of the word, however, is\nLatin <em>porcus</em> 'pig,' since the curve of the shell resembles\nthe curve of a pig's body.</p>\n<p><em>Ukulele</em>, from Hawaiian, is a metaphor from <em>'uku\n'flea'</em> plus <em>lele</em> 'to jump.'  Since ukuleles often provide\nmusic for dancing, the association might be\nfrom the dancers' flea-like movements, or there\ncould be a connection with Edward Purvis, a British\nmilitary officer who popularized the instrument in\nHawaii.</p>\n<p>Metaphor, as can be seen in this menagerie of\nwords, is ironic in that it is a great help in the creation\nof a word, but in a certain sense, it is also an\naccomplice in its death.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
