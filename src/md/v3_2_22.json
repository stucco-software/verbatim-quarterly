Certainly the punctuation mark in <em>Drink with the Urdang's</em> is a catostrophe; and the one in <em>Ham 'n Eggs</em> is a prepostrophe unless balanced by an a[fter] postrophe to mark the omission of the <em>d</em>.  (Perhaps the best way to avoid the smell of “n” you rightly deprecate in the logical <em>Ham 'n' Eggs</em> would be <em>Ham-n-Eggs</em>, in which the two hyphens announce that the compound has been manufactured for the occasion and the absence of apostrophes implies that the process of contraction has been completed so the omitted <em>a</em> and <em>d</em> are no longer missed.)</p>\n<p>My quibble is to deny the need to add an '<em>s</em> in <em>St. Paul United Methodist Church</em> (despite its Florida address), though the addition would undeniably be legitimate. The apostle is not thought of as possessing the church in any literal sense, but the use of <em>St. Paul's</em> here would be just as correct as the use of <em>Shakespeare's picture</em> in reference to a recent print that could never have belonged to the playwright.  The possessive, expressed either by an '<em>s</em> or by an <em>of</em>, has less literal implication of ownership than our grade school teachers may have led us to assume.  Conversely, it is legitimate to speak of the <em>Adams mansion</em> (without an apostrophe) whether the Adamses own it now or not; the house is associated with the Adams family in other ways too.  Such adjectival use of a noun-- either a common or a proper one--is firmly established in English.</p>\n<p>This freedom to either use or omit the '<em>s</em> is quite common, though the degree of freedom varies widely from one situation to another.  At one extreme, St. Paul's municipal auditorium (if there is one in the Minnesota city) could be called the <em>St. Paul Municipal Auditorium</em> but hardly <em>St. Paul's M.A.</em> At the other, one could not speak of <em>Mr. St. Peter's wife</em> without an apostrophe, though a number of <em>St. Peter wives</em> (or, with a slightly different sense, St. Peters' wives) might be met at a family gathering. But an association of teachers can equally well be called a Teachers' Association (because the association belongs to those who belong to it) or a Teacher Association (in which <em>Teacher</em> is used as an adjective telling what the Association consists of or is for the benefit of); probably the choice in this case is based less often on logic than on the degree of aversion to punctuation marks.  None of this, of course, is any defense for the traveler who reports having visited <em>St. Peters</em> while in Rome.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the cowbird letter by W.M. Woods [II, 4, 16] contains a misstatement, though this does not affect his argument.  The cowbird is not “a relative of the European coocoo, or cuckoo, or whatever”--regardless of its egg-laying habits--though “some immigrant, probably of German origin” might well have been misled as indicated. The cowbird is one of the blackbirds and hence is an icterid, along with the meadowlarks and orioles.  My own speculation, offered as a less amusing and less imaginative competitor to that of Woods, is that the association between cowbirds and cows may have been much closer in the days before spraying reduced the tick population on the latter. <em>[Francis E.
