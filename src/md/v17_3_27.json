Although I\nwould defend this entry on the grounds that intelligible\nellipsis lies at the core of the challenge, I could\navoid the fairly strong first objection by restoring\nthe clause-signaling <em>however</em> of my first entry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>However painful, try helping prove supersentences\nyou're disgusted by prevail</em>.  (10 words)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those who find the second objection stronger\nthan the first might accept another 10-word entry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...<em>Painful, try helping prove you're delighted\nby supersentences that prevail</em>.  (10 words)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[H.
