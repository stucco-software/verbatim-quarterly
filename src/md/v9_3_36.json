While some traditionalists\nwill always have clockwork watches and many public clocks\nwill always be of the conventional type and thus preserve the\nvisible meaning of the words, it is nevertheless interesting to\nconsider possible replacements.  In speculating on this I\nwandered along some fascinating linguistic byways.</p>\n<p>Obviously just <em>right</em> and <em>left</em> will not do since they convey\nno sense of circular movement.  Realistically, that alternatives\nwill ever be needed is highly doubtful, but a perusal of a few\ndictionaries showed me that there are far more candidates than\nI ever suspected.  The most appealing is <em>sunwise</em> or <em>sunways</em>\n'moving in the direction of the sun,' which is clockwise at least\nin the northern hemisphere (when facing south), and does\nsuggest circular movement.  It is likely to lead to confusion,\nthough, since neither of these words would mean the same in\nAustralia as in England.  Most of the words I unearthed belong\nto the province of science and do not have the simple\nunpretentiousness of <em>clockwise</em> or, in fact, the same specific\nmeaning.  Some are not true or synonymous candidates because\ntheir strict meaning includes a spiral motion.  <em>Dextrose</em> and\n<em>dextrorsal</em> are botanical words referring to climbing plants\nwhich twine upwards in a spiral from left to right.  Other plants\ntwining spirally around an axis from right to left are called\n<em>sinistrorse</em> or <em>sinistrorsal</em>.  The Latin <em>dexter</em> 'on the right' and\n<em>sinister</em> 'on the left' feature frequently in these terms.  Here\nthey are combined with <em>vorsus</em>, a variant of <em>versus</em> from <em>vertere</em>\n'to turn.'</p>\n<p>From the world of the marine biologist comes <em>dextral</em>,\nreferring to gastropod shells that have the spire or whorl\nascending from left to right as viewed by the observer.  Its\nopposite in the field of conchology is <em>sinistral</em>.  Also applying to\nshellfish are <em>dexiotropic</em> and <em>laeotropic</em>, where the shell's spire\nturns to the right and left, respectively.  These two terms refer,\nI gather, to the right and left side of the creature, not the\nobserver, as is the case with <em>dextral</em> and <em>sinistral</em>, says the\n<em>OED</em>, quoting from the 1883 edition of <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>.\nSounds like an additional complication to me.</p>\n<p>As if that were not enough to ensure the longevity of\nrefreshingly ordinary words like <em>clockwise</em>, further along the\navenues of science we come across the adjectives <em>dextrorotatory</em>\nor <em>dextrorotatary, dextrogyrous, dextrogyrate</em> and <em>dextrogyre</em>.  All\nrefer, somewhat exorbitantly, to a clockwise rotation chiefly in\nconnection with certain substances whose properties cause the\nplane of a ray of polarized light to rotate in a clockwise\ndirection.  (Hence <em>dextrose</em> 'the dextrorotatory isomer of glucose.'\nRotation in the opposite direction is known to the\ninitiated <em>as laevorotatory</em> or <em>laevogyrate</em>, from the Latin <em>laevus</em>\nmeaning 'left.'  From this we get <em>levulose</em> 'the fruit sugar with a\nlaevorotatory effect on polarized light.'</p>\n<p>It is evidently far from likely that any of these words will\never trespass into everyday writing, let alone speech, as they\nare cumbersome and obscure in their classical unfamiliarity and\nlack the homey straightforwardness of <em>clockwise</em> and <em>anticlock-wise</em>.\nEven those unacquainted with old-fashioned clockwork\ntimepieces would be more comfortable with <em>clockwise</em> than any\nof these arcane technical terms.  The everyday words we now\nuse are, moreover, more useful since they may be employed\nboth adjectivally (<em>a clockwise turn</em>) and adverbially (<em>he turned\nclockwise</em>) without any change to the word.  The long Latinate\nadjectives require further lengthening with the adverbial suffix,\nand who would ever use <em>dextrogyrately</em> or <em>sinistrorsally?</em></p>\n<p>In passing it may be of interest to note that other\nlanguages tackle the matter in various ways and somewhat\nuncomfortably too.  For <em>clockwise</em> my French dictionary has\n“dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre,” the inadequate “à\ndroite” and the rare “dextrorsum” (=Latin 'turned towards\nthe right').  Spanish also prefers to define <em>clockwise</em> rather than\nprovide an equivalent word: “en el sentido de las agujas del\nreloj.”  Italian is more concise with <em>destrorso</em>, while the German\nis more akin to English: <em>im Uhrzeigensinn</em> 'in clock-handssense.'</p>\n<p>Like many words, <em>clockwise</em>, to me, has a meaning in itself\nwhich is not inseparable from the progressively more extraneous\nimage of the hands and face of a clock.  This is another\nreason such words will outlive the object which they are\ninitially associated with: their meaning transcends that of their\ncomponents.  When I use <em>clockwise</em> I give no more thought to a\nclock than I do to honey when I use <em>honeymoon</em> (or to <em>moon</em>,\nfor that matter), or to a pig when I write <em>pig-iron</em>.  I think that\n<em>clockwise</em> has reached—or will eventually reach-that stage.\nSome other words where the components are so separated that\nthey are really remote from the word as a whole are <em>window</em>\n“wind-eye,” <em>daisy</em> “day's eye,” <em>scapegoat, gossamer</em> “goosesummer,”\n<em>handicap</em> “hand-in-cap,” <em>bonfire</em> “bone-fire,” <em>halibut</em>\n“holy butt” or <em>flatfish</em>, etc.  Centuries of use have blurred the\nwords' elements as well as awareness of the original elements\nof their composition.</p>\n<p>Technical changes are always likely to take us further from\nfamiliar objects which gave rise to words and expressions, but\nif the words and expressions are useful, essential, picturesque\nor more convenient than other expressions, then they are likely\nto survive.</p>\n<p><em>[Peter A.
