The debates\nthat Deborah Cameron illustrates are fundamental\nto everyone's use of language whether they\nbe female or male—how it is used, how it is perceived\nand received by speakers and readers of both\nsexes, how it can on the one hand bolster and on the\nother break down attitudes and prejudices, and how\nit can create new awarenesses.</p>\n<p><em>The Feminist Critique of Language</em> brings together\na wide range of views and approaches to its\nsubject, ranging from the conservative linguist Otto\nJespersen and the author Virginia Woolf writing in\nthe 1920s to contemporary critics.  One of the main\nstrengths of the collection is that it does not just put\nforward one view, it maps out the debate allowing\ndifferent views to be stated and then criticized or\nrevised.  The eighteen essays and extracts and the\nperceptive introduction reveal the range and depth\nof the debate about feminism and language.</p>\n<p>Cameron divides the book into three main sections.\nThe first, “Speech and Silence,” has Woolf as\nits starting point and includes Cora Kaplan on “Language\nand gender” as well as two French extracts\nfrom Annie Leclerc on “Woman's word” and an interview\nwith the leading French psychologist Luce\nIrigary entitled “Woman's exile.”  These essays explore\nthe notion of women's “silence” and the utopian\nquest for a specifically female voice in culture.\nMuch of the real meat of the book comes in Part\nTwo, “ 'Naming' and Representation.”  Dale\nSpender's quasi-Worfian views on “man made language,”\npublished in 1980, are counterbalanced by\nthe perceptive 1981 review of Spender's book by\nMaria Black and Rosalind Coward.  Muriel R.\nSchulz's 1975 essay on the semantic derogation of\nwomen leads into a discussion of compiling a <em>Feminist\nDictionary</em> against the grain of the authors' view\nin predominantly male lexicography.</p>\n<p>One of the main strengths of this collection is\nthat it makes available to specialists—students of literature\nfor instance—material which would otherwise\nhave been extremely difficult to get hold of.\nThis applies in particular to essays such as Anne Bodine's\non “Androcentrism in prescriptive grammar:\nsingular 'they,' sex-indefinite 'he,' and 'he or she.' ”\nFirst published in 1975, this dryly written paper\nprovides much of the analytical information needed\nto counter the stereotypical “hysterical fuss” reaction.\nBodine analyzes the ways in which (male)\ngrammarians (both descriptive and prescriptive)\nhave since the seventeenth century sought to establish\n<em>he</em> as the sex-indefinite pronoun despite evidence\nthat actual usage consistently contradicts that.\nIt is a pity that the most recent material in the collection\nappeared in the mid 1980s.  In answer to\nAnne Bodine's point, both the <em>Longman Dictionary\nof Contemporary English</em> and the Collins <em>Cobuild\nDictionary</em> use <em>they</em> and <em>their</em> as the non-gender-specific\npronoun/adjective (which the reader probably\nnoted also in the first paragraph of this review).</p>\n<p>The <em>Critique</em> has an amusing slant, too.  One of\nthe most telling and effective exposés of the entrenched\nnature of sexism in language is Douglas\nHofstaedter's pseudonymous parody “A person paper\non purity in language,” written as a supposed\ndebunking of “silly prattle” about racist language.\nHe uses <em>white</em> and <em>black</em> in the place of <em>man</em> and\n<em>woman</em> in examples such as <em>chairwhite, Frenchwhite,\nwhitepower, whitehandle, oneupwhiteship</em>, and so on.\nThrough such strategies and telling adaptations of\nquotations like “All whites are created equal,” “One\nsmall step for a white, one giant step for whitekind”\nHofstaedter's short piece becomes a cutting revelation\nof just how deep-seated are not only sexist but\nracial prejudices in language.</p>\n<p>The final part of the book, “Dominance and Difference\nin Women's Linguistic Behaviour,” examines\nhow women actually use language, tackling\nsuch areas as gossip, “tag” questions, and conversational\ngambits.  I found this the least satisfactory section\nin that the necessarily short extracts could not\nprovide sufficient detail.</p>\n<p>Cameron deliberately excludes some of the\nmore familiar work which is available elsewhere.  So\nthis collection contains texts that are more marginal\nthan would he ideal for students who may read nothing\nelse on the subject.  It also means that some important\nnames, such as Julia Kristeva and Toril Moi,\nare omitted.  Her thematic structure also slightly defuses\nthe impact of the debate.  By beginning with\nVirginia Woolf instead of some of the more linguistically\noriented material (Bodine, Lakoff, and so on),\nshe does not immediately establish the ground to be\nbroken.  A chronological structure would have directly\njuxtaposed Jespersen with Woolf and then enabled\nthe reader to find a way through the developments\nin the debate, giving a more coherent picture\nof the broadening issues.</p>\n<p>A stimulating and entertaining collection, <em>The\nFeminist Critique of Language</em> acknowledges and reflects\nthe range of the debates about women and language,\nnot only today but since the 1920s.  It should\nbe included in student reading lists, but it also deserves\nto be prescribed reading for those who feel\nthemselves to be concerned with language—across\nthe spectrum from the (hopefully diminishing) ranks\nof the “hysterical fuss” brigade to already committed\nfeminists.</p>\n<p><em>Kathy Rooney</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
