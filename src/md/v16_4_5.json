Although that is a better\ntitle than the new one, something more apropos\nwould be <em>Words to Impress Your Friends By</em>.  Its main\ngoal is to increase your vocabulary.  As any reader of\nVERBATIM knows, there are many books on the market\ndesigned to do exactly this; however, one can\nrarely get through more than the first few chapters\nof such tomes.  This volume, I am happy to report, is\ndifferent.  I recommend it for those (as the book's\ncover observes): “—who want to speak more effectively,\nwrite more colorfully or be better prepared\nfor the SAT” (the verbal portion of the Scholastic\nAptitude Test, a widely used instrument for\nuniversity admission).</p>\n<p>The reason that most books of this type (<em>How to\nIncrease Your $5 Words in 7 Days or Double Your\nMoney Back</em> [Satisfaction Guaranteed]) fail is that\nthey are boring, or mundance, or both.  The reader\ngets the book home and proceeds to memorize polysyllabic\nwords by the dozens, with their lenghthy definitions\ncoupled with made-up sentences which often\nmake little sense or, if they do make sense are\ndull at best.  Then the student gets through the mechanical\ntask of taking multiple-choice examinations\nor fill-in-the-blank quizzes, which are usually a\nwaste of time because the words and its meaning are\nusually forgotten within a day or two.</p>\n<p>How does this book then differ from the competition?\nFor one thing, the author has taken as illustrative\nexamples many important words and expressions\nfrom the rather lively and well-composed\npages of <em>The New York Times</em> (1,455) lexemes, to be\nexact, although we can quible about some of the\nentries).  For another, the definitions are, on the\nwhole, well written and to the point.  For example,\nconsider the word <em>electic</em>, which is defined as:\n“composed of material or ideas gathered from a variety\nof sources.”  Its meaning is illustrated quite\nnicely by the following <em>New York Times</em> passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Live artillery shells, a dead sea turtle half the size\nof a Volkswagen Bettle, a drowned giraffe, antique\ncrockery, pocketbooks, chemical sludge,\nraw sewage and about 5,000 cords of driftwood\na year—the waters of New York Harbor yield a\nstrage and eclectic bounty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most of the 1,455 examples are excellent\nchoices, and Greenman's definitions and illustrations\nare well done; there are, however, some significant\nerrors to report.</p>\n<p>Under the term <em>lingua franca</em> (p. 196), for instance,\nwe learn that “the original lingua franca (Italian,\nFrankish language) was a hybrid language...\nspoken...in the 17th century.  It consisted mostly\nof Italian words without their inflections.”  Linguists\nhave demonstrated that the first lingua france (called\nMediterranean Lingua Franca by many linguists) was\nactually spoken before the first Crusade began in A.D. 1096. There is a document written in it from Djerba,\nTunisia, dating from A.D. 1353.  In addition to Italian\nvocabulary, the language also included many items\nfrom another Romance language, Proven\\ccedil\\al.  As mediterrancean\nLingua Franca was used on the Barbary\nCoast of North Africa, there were many words that it\nborrowed from Spanish and Portuguese.  In fact, one\nsuch word is <em>savvy</em> ('shreed; in the know'), which\nGreenman erroneously derivers (p. 284) from Spanish\n<em>sabe usted</em> 'do you know?' The word came into Mediterranean\nLingua Franca from Portuguese.  That is not\nsuch a serious error, however, since Spanish and Portuguese\nare closely related.</p>\n<p>Some of the book's lexical entries are questionable.\nI see no reason to include, for instance, the\nfollowing words: <em>antiseptic, novel, nosh</em> ('snack,'\nfrom Yiddish), <em>novice, theorem, threshold</em>, or <em>tycoon</em>.\nI believe all of these, with the exception of <em>nosh</em>, are\nfairly well known by the average college freshman,\nthough readers may decide for themselves if I am\nwrong on this point.  I do not consider the word <em>nosh</em>\nimportant enough, or for that matter frequent\nenough, to have been included.  Certainly, it is\ndoubtful that one would encounter it on an SAT examination.\nI have exactly the same sentiment for\n<em>chutzpah</em> 'brazen nerve' (from Herbrew via Yiddish),\nwhich is also included (p. 62), as well as <em>bubkes</em>\n'something trivial' (from Russian via Yiddish, p. 46).\nHowever, one must remember that <em>The New York\nTimes</em> is read in New York, which has a sizable jewish\npopulation, and these three examples are probably\nknown and used by most New Yorkers (even\ngentiles, such as the late authour and raconteur Alexander\nKing, one of my all-time favorites and a regular\non the old Jack Paar Show, who used them regularly\nin speech as well as in writing).</p>\n<p>I am delighted to report that the special diacritica\nare shown for the common European loanwords\nlike French <em>nat\\i2dot\\veté</em> 'artlessness; ingenuousness' (p.\n218), or German <em>Gemütlichkeit</em> a 'feeling of warmth\nand congeniality' (p. 145).  These diacritical marks\nare now, unfortunately, left off in many publications,\nso we must praise Greenman's efforts here.  Alas, the\nway things are going in many periodicals, diacritics\nin English will soon be a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>One can also find some definitions here and\nthere that are not entirely wrong yet with which one\nmight disagree.  <em>Kamikaze</em> (p. 187), for example, is\ndefined as: “a suicide attack by a Japanese airplane\npilot in World War II; the airplane or pilot in such an\nattack.”  In my own semantic system (and English is\nmy native language), <em>Kamikaze</em> does not usually\nmean 'a pilot' because I have to say <em>'Kamikaze</em> pilot'\nto refer to someone who is involved in a <em>kamikaze</em>\nmission.</p>\n<p>The pronunciation transcrition system (see the\nKey, pp.3-4) the book uses follows the <em>N.B.C.\nHandbook of Pronunciation</em> (Thomas Y. Crowell,\n1964), Which is imprecise and hard to interpret in\nmany places.  I have never understood why the International\nPhonetic Alphabet is not used in English\ndictionaries of all sorts, but this is beyond the scope\nof our remarks in this review.  I would certainly recommend\nthe I.P.A. here.</p>\n<p>An extra treat ends the book (pp. 343-379).\nShort essays on verbs of action, puns, slang (we are\ntold that <em>wimp</em> was popular during the 1960s and\n'70s, p. 348; how about the ' 80s where it was very\nfrequently used in the 1988 election campaign?),\nnuance words, and how to use the colon, semicolon,\ndash, and parentheses.</p>\n<p>I found the last two essays the most entertaining\nand particularly useful: 1) “E Pluribus Unum: The\nMelting Pot of English” (pp. 362-365) deals with\nthe many languges that have served as sources for\nEnglish vocabulary, and 2) “Usage: The Good, the\nBad, and the Ugly” (pp. 366-379) comments on\nsuch common errors as <em>carat</em> for <em>karat</em>.  In case you\ndo not see the point with these two words, the book\nis probably for you.  (Even many dictionaries have\nthis wrong, as <em>carat</em> is not a free variant of <em>karat</em>,\nalthough both derive from Arabic <em>q\\itilde\\r\\atilde\\t.  “Gemstones\nare weighed by carats</em>...the fineness of gold is\nmeasured in <em>karats</em>” [p. 371].)</p>\n<p>As you have no doubt already surmised, this is\nnot (to use another Greenman word) a <em>schlock</em> (p.1) book.  It is worth buying and reading for fun and, you never know, for profit too.</p>\n<p><em>[Alan S. Kaye, California State University, Fullerton]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
