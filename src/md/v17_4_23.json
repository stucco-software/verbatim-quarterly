But I have\nbeen unable to find any recommendations regarding\nthe quotations of oral material, though such quotations\nare very common in newspapers and other\nperiodicals that deal with current affairs and, especially,\nwith “the world of” entertainment and\n“celebrities.”  (The quotations marks are intended\nto emphasize criticism of the practice of all the media\nto devote an inordinate amount of time and\nspace to the interviewing and promotion of actors,\nsingers, and other entertainers, most of whom have\nnothing to say and who make their living uttering\nwords created by others.

If\nan American writer quotes a British speaker as saying,\n“Honor thy father,” it would be arrant nonsense\nfor some pedant to say, “If he is British, he did not\nsay that.  He said, 'Honour thy father.' ”  And, in a\nrecent article by Peter Stothard in <em>The Times Saturday\nReview</em> [27 October 1990:11] about Dianne\nFeinstein, the California politician, she is quoted as\nsaying, “California does not want to swap one grey\npinstripe suit for another grey pinstripe suit,” in\nwhich it would be silly to point out that, as an American,\nshe would have said “gray,” not “grey.”  On\nthe other hand, the same article quoted George\nBush as having said, “I kicked some arse last night”\nin his debate against Geraldine Ferraro in the 1984\ncampaign for vice president, and we all know that\nBush does not say <em>arse</em>.  In reference to Feinstein's\nadversary in the recent campaign, Pete Wilson, an\nanonymous taunt is quoted as “And what about Wilson's\nnew blue Paul Newman contact lenses?  And\nhis stepped-up shoes?”  As the taunter was an American,\nwhy is he using the Briticism <em>stepped-up shoes</em>?\nAdmittedly, its meaning is transparent, but Americans\ndo not use expressions like <em>stepped-up shoes</em>.</p>\n<p>Some idioms do need translating.  If such an idiom\noccurs in a direct quotation it ought to be left\nthe way it was, then explained, even though the\nrhythm of the writing be disturbed.  In live interviews\nthat is not always easily done, especially when\nthe interviewer is unfamiliar with an expression and\nis too embarrassed to admit it.  In a recent television\ninterview a British actor was recounting an anecdote\nin which he used the idiom <em>the penny dropped</em>,\nwhich means 'I saw the light, came the dawn.'  A\nmomentary flicker of perplexity on the interviewer's\nface showed that he had not the slightest idea of\nwhat the speaker had said, but he blandly continued\nwithout missing a stroke.</p>\n<p>I am reminded of an incident that took place\nsome twenty years ago, when I first began visiting\nBritain regularly and was unfamiliar with nonliterary\nBriticisms.  Several of us were locked in a long and\ntiring discussion of a project's costs, which I considered\nto be realistic and the others thought expensive.\nFinally, a bit exasperated, I blurted out what I\nthought would be the metaphor that would settle\nthe issue, saying, “If you want to make a penny,\nyou've got to spend a penny!”  Although those present\nwere too polite to split their sides and roll about\nin hysterics, they were obviously amused, for, as was\nexplained to me, I had picked the wrong metaphor:\n<em>spend a penny</em> is a Briticism for 'go to the loo,' or, as\nthey say in America, 'the bathroom.'  (It might not\nbe inappropriate here to point out that, in addition\nto this British idiom, the only other major contribution\nmade to culture by pay toilets was the invention,\nin Scotland, I understand, of limbo dancing.)</p>\n<p>Struggling back to the subject, I should suggest\nthat in quoting spoken material, mere spelling of the\norder of <em>honor/honour, traveler/traveller, paneling/\npanelling</em> should follow the style of the medium,\nwherever it is published.  The speaker's words\nshould never be changed; that is, <em>arse</em> ought not be\nsubstituted for <em>ass</em> or vice versa and, if an explanation\nof an unfamiliar word or phrase is required, it\nought to be supplied, even if this must be relegated\nto a footnote.  In this particular case, it is doubtful\nthat anyone reading <em>The Times</em> is unaware of the\nmeaning of American <em>ass</em>.  Another alternative, not\nalways possible, is to avoid entirely the passage containing\nthe problem word or phrase.  Perhaps the\nbest choice is to use indirect discourse: <em>Bush said\nthat he had kicked some arse in his debate against</em>...\nAlmost anything is preferable to putting into people's\nmouths things they did not say.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
