The Mohammedan contribution to astronomy\nwas actually much less remarkable than their contribution to\narithmetic.  They called astrology '<em>ilm ahqām</em> (or <em>sina 'āt</em>) <em>al\nnudjūm, 'science of the decrees of the stars' and astronomy\n'ilm al hai'a</em>, or 'science of the aspects (of the universe).'

During that same era, the European astronomers\nwere lucky to be able to make accurate predictions for the\ndates of religious holidays.

The Greeks apparently saw the stars simply as\npatterns, that is, as <em>constellations</em>.  The Arabs, on the other hand,\nfocused their attention on the individual stars themselves.</p>\n<p>The oldest extant star catalogue is the <em>Almagest</em> of\nPtolemy (137 A.D.).  It was replaced by an Arabian catalogue\nin the 15th century.  Many abortive attempts were made by\nthe Europeans to replace the pagan Greek and—to the Europeans—the\nbarbarous-sounding Semitic star names with more\nmodern ones.  The best-documented of these was that of Juluius\nSchiller (1627).  In his <em>Coelum Stellatum Christianum</em> ('The\nChristian Stars of Heaven') he made a zealous effort to replace\nall the fascinating old names with the tiresome names of\npopes, bishops, saints, and the like.  That he failed utterly is\ntestimony to the innate good sense of the human race, which\nobviously prefers that the stars retain their ancient mystery\nand romance and not be dragged down to the level of commonplace\nChurch dignitaries.</p>\n<p>But aside from a few Latin names: <em>Sirius</em> 'the dog star'\n(<em>Sothis</em> of Ancient Egypt); <em>Regulus</em> 'the little king'; <em>Foramen</em>\n'the opening'; <em>Manubrium</em> 'a handle'—and others from Greek\nmythology, such as <em>Alcyone</em> in the Pleiades, etc.—an amazing\nnumber of the most common stars retain their old Arabic\nnames.  What, then do they all mean?  Good question—and\none not so easy to answer as one might think.  There are few\nreference works that can supply us with everything we want.</p>\n<p>For the benefit of the reader's curiosity, here are a few\norigins that are known by Arab scholars, plus a couple of\nguesses (indicated by question marks).  The reason that\nguesses should sometimes be necessary at all owes itself to the\nfact that transliterating from the Arabic writing often obscures\nthe original words.  For example, the star <em>Algol</em>, which is\nlocated in Taurus, is given in many dictionaries as descending\nfrom <em>al-ghāla</em>, 'the destroyer,' but its more likely origin is the\nmore familiar form from the same root: <em>ghul</em> 'a woodland\ndemon' from which we got our word <em>ghoul</em>, 'a defiler of\ngraves.'  The Egyptians themselves, of course, were the first to\nbreak into the ancient tombs to seek their pharaonic treasures,\nbut the Arabs did their share of such grave-robbing, too,\nwe have been told.  Most of the names given here, however,\nare accepted with little question by historians.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Achernar</em> 'Last fire.'</p>\n<p><em>Aldebaran</em> (<em>Al-dabarān</em> is from <em>dabar</em> 'to follow'\nbecause it follows upon the Pleiades.)  A star in the\nconstellation of Taurus (<em>Thūru</em> in Arabic) means 'the\none who is more easily led' or 'The Follower,' referring\nto one of a team of oxen.  The -<em>an</em> ending here\napparently does not indicate the accusative, but\nrather the dual, as in a pair.</p>\n<p><em>Adhafera</em> 'The one who holds out' or 'The\nVictorious.'</p>\n<p><em>Algenubi</em> 'The Southerner.'</p>\n<p><em>Algorab</em> 'The Crow.'</p>\n<p><em>Alhena</em> 'The Henna' (because it is red).</p>\n<p><em>Alioth</em> (<em>Alyat</em>) 'fat tail of a sheep.'</p>\n<p><em>Al Jabhah</em> 'The Front' or 'Forehead.'</p>\n<p><em>Almach</em> 'The Brain.'</p>\n<p><em>Alphard</em> 'The Solitary One.'</p>\n<p><em>Altair</em> Corrupted Arabic for 'The Bird.'</p>\n<p><em>Antares</em> Not Arabic, but Greek: Like Ares' (cf. <em>Arctic</em>\nand <em>Antarctic</em>).</p>\n<p><em>Alpharg</em> Like the Roman star, <em>Foramen</em>, 'The Opening.'</p>\n<p><em>Baten Kaitos</em> 'Inside the Whale' (see <em>Deneb Kaitos</em>).</p>\n<p><em>Betelgeuse</em> (Properly <em>bat-al-jauza</em>) 'Shoulder of the\nCentral One.'</p>\n<p><em>Caphir</em> 'Atheist.'</p>\n<p><em>Dabih</em> 'Slitter' or 'Slasher.'</p>\n<p><em>Deneb</em> 'Tail,' hence all names like <em>Deneb Adige</em> 'tail of\nNight's Darkness,' <em>Deneb Algedi</em> 'Tail of the Kid';\n<em>Deneb</em> by itself, however, refers to <em>Dhanab AlDajājah</em>\n'Tail of the Hen.'</p>\n<p><em>Deneb Kaitos</em> (<em>Dhanab gaytūs</em>) from Gr. <em>kētos</em> 'whale.'</p>\n<p><em>Denebola</em> (Abbrev. of <em>dhanab al-asad</em>) 'Tail of the\nLion.'</p>\n<p><em>Dhur</em> (<em>Zahr</em>) abbr. of <em>zahr al-asad</em>) 'Back of the Lion.'</p>\n<p><em>Difda or Diphda</em> (Properly, modern: <em>dufda</em>) 'Frog.'</p>\n<p><em>Dirah</em> 'Little house.'</p>\n<p><em>Dubhe</em> (From <em>Al-Dubb al-Akbar</em>) 'The Greater Bear,'\n2nd mag. star Alpha <em>Ursae Maioris</em>.</p>\n<p><em>El Nath</em> 'The Butting' (as of two rams or goats).</p>\n<p><em>Fomalhaut</em> (Properly <em>fam</em> for 'mouth,' cognate of Greek\n<em>phemū</em> and <em>al-hūt</em>) 'Mouth of the Whale.'</p>\n<p><em>Giedi</em> 'Goat's...(tail?)' —considered part of Capricorn,\nthough technically in Aquarius.</p>\n<p><em>Hamal</em> 'Lamb.'</p>\n<p><em>Homam</em> (<em>Sa'd al-hūmam</em>) 'Luck of the Hero.'</p>\n<p><em>Kitalpha</em> (<em>qit'ah al-faras</em>) 'Part of the Mare' in const. of\nEquuleus.</p>\n<p><em>Lesath</em> 'Jawbone'?

Arabic astronomy/\nastrology had a rather naive premise, that the moon\nand planets were all in conjuction at the beginning\nof time and in a million years will be in conjunction\nagain.  This idea was based on a work called <em>Al-Sindhind</em>\n(a very ancient treatise on astronomy,\na corruption of the Sanskrit <em>Siddhāntā</em>).</p>\n<p><em>Sadr</em> Short for <em>sadr al-dajājah</em> 'Breast of the Chicken.'</p>\n<p><em>Schedar</em> (Sadr) 'upper part.'</p>\n<p><em>Saiph</em> 'Sword.'</p>\n<p><em>Sheratan</em> Two stars in the horns of Aries, dual of <em>sharot</em>\n'sign; notch.'</p>\n<p><em>Tejat</em> 'Crown.'</p>\n<p><em>Unukhalhai</em> 'Neck of the Snake.'</p>\n<p><em>Wasat</em> 'Middle' (of the constellation).</p>\n<p><em>Wega</em> (<em>or Vega</em>) (Properly <em>waji</em>') 'Falling.'</p>\n<p><em>Yed</em> (<em>Pior</em> or <em>Posterior</em>) 'Yed' is probably 'hand.'</p>\n<p><em>Zaniah</em> Variation of <em>Zavijava</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Zuben El Genubi</em> 'The Southern Claw' (of the\nScorpion).</p>\n<p><em>Zubeneschamali</em> 'The Northern Claw' (of the Scorpion).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the original meanings of the stars are often difficult\nto obtain, I would be grateful to any reader who is able to\ncome up with any additions to this list.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Works Cited</p>\n<p><em>The Islamic Encyclopedia</em></p>\n<p><em>Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia</em></p>\n<p><em>Webster's New Intl. 2nd Ed. 1956</em></p>\n<p><em>Islamic Society of California</em></p>\n<p><em>Ahlam Abu-Zayyad</em></p>\n<p>Seyyed Hossein Nasr <em>Science &amp; Civilization in Islam</em></p>",
