Carter</span></h1>\n<p>As an addendum to Milton Horowitz's letter\n[XVI,2] about the depiction of Moses with horns, I\nwant to come to the defense of St. Jerome.  That holy\ncurmudgeon is usually chided for translating Exodus\n34:29 incorrectly in the Vulgate Bible.  Alas, I have\nfew scholarly works to which to refer, but I looked\nconfidently into my battered copy of Edward Robinson's\nA Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament\n(25th Edition, 1888).  This is a translation and\namplification of Gesenius' original Latin work.</p>\n<p>Of the entries under qaran (pp. 943f.) only the\nuse in this passage is translated without some reference\nto “horn.”  Robinson notes initially with regard\nto this verb that the primary syllable should be compared\nto the Sanskrit carnis 'horn,' from car 'to\nbore.'  The derivative forms (qeren, etc.) are all translated\nwith some reference to “horn,” except the\ndual form, qarnaim, which is translated “rays of\nlight, splendour.”  But Robinson goes on to note\neven with this form: “So Arabian poets compare the\nfirst rays of the rising sun to horns; and hence call\nthe sun itself the gazelle....”</p>\n<p>Even more illuminating is an entry (p. 944):\n“Hence in prophetic vision, horns are” symbolic of\n“kings, powerful princes...” Daniel 7:24 and 8:21\nare cited.  And then Robinson bids us compare “the\nArabic epithet of Alexander the Great” which he\ntranslates as the Latin word, <em>bicornis</em> 'two-horned.'\nHe goes on to observe that this is “the symbol of\npower, might; so both Alexander and the Seleucidae\nare represented on coins with horns....”</p>\n<p>The Septuagint translates <em>qaran</em>, in the passage\nof Exodus 34:29, with a Greek verb used in the New\nTestament to mean: “to praise, extol, magnify, celebrate;\nto honor, do honor to, hold in honor; to make\nglorious, adorn with lustre, clothe with splendor; to\nmake renowned, render illustrious, i.e., to cause the\ndignity and worth of some person or thing to become\nmanifest and acknowledged; to exalt to a glorious\nrank or condition...” (Thayer, A Greek-English\nLexicon of the New Testament).  How readily St.\nJerome might associate these meanings of the more\nphilosophical Greek with the horn imagery of power\nin the more ancient Hebrew.</p>\n<p>The symbolism of power conveyed by horns and\nhorn-related Hebrew (and other Semitic) words as\nportrayed on the aforementioned coins (or some\nothers, which might have used the same imagery but\nwhich are no longer extant) may well have led St.\nJerome to his translation.</p>\n<p>In any case, his translation, in light of the foregoing,\nseems as plausible to me as the exceptional\nusage given approval by the “accepted” translations.\nSo, before we fault St. Jerome for a blunder,\nlet us consider that so impressive a linguistic scholar\nas he may have chosen to give Moses horns deliberately\nby using cognate imagery he understood to\nstand for dignity and power.\nRoy B. Flinchbaugh, Jr.\n<em>York, Pennsylvania</em></p>\n<p>[By the way, Michelangelo's statue of Moses\n(with horns) is in the church of <em>San Pietro in Vincoli</em>\n(“St. Peter in Chains”) on the Esquiline in Rome.  It\nwas spelled incorrectly in VERBATIM.—Editor]</p>\n<p>Lysander Kemp reminded me of a malapropism\nin Spanish which I created for myself.  When I was\neight my family moved from London to Buenos Aires.\nMy Mother, who believed that children should\nlearn languages as early as possible, dropped me into\nthe local Argentine school where I absorbed Spanish\nby a kind of osmosis—except for one phrase.  In\nschool we sang a song the first line of which was:\n“En los patios de la escuela la cesando el gran rumor.”\n(In the school patios the great noise—'hubbub'—is\nceasing).  I happily sang: “En los patios de\nla escuela va Cesandro, el Gran Rumor.”  who\n“Cesandro” was or why he was the Great Rumor,\nwhatever that was, I hadn't the faintest idea but obviously\nhe was out in the patios while we were in\nclass.  It was very many years before, remembering\nthis, I realized what I had been supposed to be singing.</p>\n<p><em>[Galina H. Carter, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
