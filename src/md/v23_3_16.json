Does it provide proof that death is no longer taboo, or are such euphemisms the victims of a modern contempt for flowery, imprecise language? For whatever reason, phrases such as <em>pushing up daisies, breathed his last, is no more, gone to a better world</em>, etc. sound decidedly old-fashioned these days.

Dare to announce that the king is dead in so many words and you could soon be feeding the worms yourself. The accepted formula varies from place to place. The Baule people of Ivory Cost say that the King has hurt his foot, while the Diola of Senegal say that the earth is broken. For the Fon people of Benin the appropriate phrase is <em>Night has fallen</em> or <em>The King has returned to Allada</em>.
