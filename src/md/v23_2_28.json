Abootty, Kerala, India</em></p>\n<p>Many years ago I came across a meaningful sentence attributed to Rabindranath Tagore, the only Indian writer to win the Nobel Prize:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Worship God and attain a soul devoid of anger, passion, and guilt</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Memorize this sentence, because it is not only meaningful but also useful in that it will enable one to find out the day of any date except in leap years.</p>\n<p>The sentence has twelve words. Each word is connected with each month, respectively, that is, <em>worship</em> for January, <em>God</em> for February, <em>and</em> for March, and so on. Here is the method to apply in finding the day of any date of any year except leap years. (Leap years are easy to identify: they are any year divisible by 4 and centuries divisible by 400: thus, 2000 will be a leap year, but 1900 was not.)</p>\n<p>India became independent on 15 August 1947.</p>\n<p>To find the day of the week on which that date fell, first divide 1947 by 4: the answer is <em>486</em> (with a remainder of 3, which should be ignored); add this number: <em>1947 + 486 = 2433</em>. Then find the word that stands for August, the eighth month—<em>of</em>—and add the number of its letters: <em>2 + 2433 = 2435.</em> Now add the date sought: <em>2435 + 15 = 2450.</em> Divide this number by 7: <em>2450 ÷ 7 = 350 with 0 remainder.</em></p>\n<p>Now, the days of the week are numbered 0 through 6, beginning with Friday: <em>0 = Friday; 1 = Saturday; 2 = Sunday; 3 = Monday; 4 = Tuesday; 5 = Wednesday; 6 = Thursday.</em></p>\n<p>Ergo, India's Independence Day, 15 August 1947, fell on a Friday.</p>\n<p>Take another example: V-E Day, 8 May 1945:</p>\n<p><em>1945 ÷ 4 = 486 (+ 1).</em></p>\n<p><em>1945 + 486 = 2431.</em></p>\n<p><em>May = “A” = 1 + 2431 = 2432.</em></p>\n<p><em>2432 + 8 = 2440.</em></p>\n<p><em>2440 ÷ 7 = 348 + 4.</em></p>\n<p><em>4 = Tuesday.</em></p>\n<p>And a final one: the day Lincoln was shot, 14 April 1865:</p>\n<p><em>1865 ÷ 4 = 466 (+ 1).</em></p>\n<p><em>1865 + 466 = 2331.</em></p>\n<p><em>April = “attain” = 6 + 2331 = 2337.</em></p>\n<p><em>2337 + 14 = 2351.</em></p>\n<p><em>2351 / 7 = 335 + 6.</em></p>\n<p><em>6 = Thursday.</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
