That element\nis the significant <em>how</em>.</p>\n<p>Carefully listening to the latest verdicts, I have learned\nthat the readers of scores or the writers of scores who work\nfor wire services lack variety in decribing the manner of victory\nor defeat. Beat (or <em>beaten</em>) is used most frequently,\nalthough <em>downed</em> (“The Phillies downed the Cubs 4-2”) and\n<em>over</em> (“The Indians over the Tigers 7-3”) also appear often\nin the litany. Like a club owner who resists change these reporters\n(or, more precisely, reciters) continue to use the\nsame words day after day. Occasionally, when a team is\nshut out, a creative imp might throw in a statement like\n“The Mets blanked the Reds 2-0,” but soon things are back\nto <em>beat</em> and <em>over</em> and <em>out</em> (<em>out</em> being the commercial).</p>\n<p>When one considers the hundreds of verbs waiting\neagerly to get their chance, it seems rather heartless to play\nthe same line-up all the time. No matter what the outcome,\nthe English language boasts a full pen of terms waiting to\ngo into action. Was it a close game? The lackluster <em>got by</em>\nmay bid for a tryout, but it pales beside the likes of <em>edged,\nnudged, nipped</em>, and <em>trimmed</em>. A lopsided contest? “The\nTwins took the Angels” sounds as if the teams are dating.\nBut the listener who hears <em>slapped, destroyed, trounced,\nclubbed, pounded, clobbered, slugged, slammed, punished,\nrouted</em>, or <em>pummeled</em> inserted into a program will know\nthat a team has taken a beating. For those who claim that\nthey lack sufficient air time to search for words, here is an\neasy-to-remember handful: <em>tripped, clipped, tipped, ripped,\nwhipped</em>, and (for shutouts) <em>zipped</em>.</p>\n<p>With a little practice a sportscaster could develop a\ndelivery with enough panache to please even connoisseurs.\nA gourmet might be delighted to know that the Giants\n<em>grated</em> the Braves 10-1 and the Orioles <em>battered</em> the Yankees\n12-2. Teams could be <em>diced, sliced</em>, and <em>shredded</em> to please\nany palate. Various types of artists formerly preoccupied\nwith aesthetics might pause in their work to listen to reports\nthat included terms like <em>outstroked, pasted, welded, blotted\nout, smashed, chiseled, needled</em>, and <em>tattooed</em>. And those involved\nin the fashion world would certainly respond\nfavorably to descriptions of teams <em>socking, belting, collaring,\nhandcuffing</em>, and <em>straitjacketing</em> their hapless\nopponents.</p>\n<p>There are many other candidates capable of pinchhitting\nfor the overworked veterans, but they may be destined\nfor early retirement unless the managers of language\ntoss off the enchantments of sloth. By now these people who\nare responsible for the delivery of official results should\nknow that the easy word, the one that comes immediately\nto mind, is often the dullest. Not only will the reader of\nscores who varies his verbs find the task less tedious but\nthose listening will be released from the strains of\nmonotonic repetition that seem to emanate from every station.\nThen they may discover that it is not just this listener\nto whom the winning and losing is not as important as how\nyou say the game.</p>",
