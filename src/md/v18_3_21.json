Sara Tulloch, (Oxford University Press, 1991), xi + 322pp. and Jonathon Green, (Bloomsbury Publishing, 1991), xi + 339pp.</p>\n<p>It is always interesting to see the publication of\ntwo competing books on the same subject appear at\nthe same time, for the reviewer is thereby given the\nopportunity to “compare and/or contrast” them.\nThese two, as can be seen from the bibliographic\ninformation above, are almost exactly the same\nlength, and their trim sizes are identical; the typography\nof the <em>ODNW</em> is superior as is the binding,\n<em>Neologisms</em>, though higher priced, being perfectbound,\nlike a paperback, and characterized by atrocious\ntypography.  According to the blurbs, the former\ncontains 2000 entries, the latter 2700; but the\n<em>ODNW</em> is more densely packed with information—\nat least thirty per cent more, by my calculations.</p>\n<p>“More,” as we all know, is not necessarily “better.”\nThere is some overlapping of entries, but the\nbooks offer somewhat different kinds of coverage.\nIn the first place, with all the new dictionaries published\nsince 1960 and the updatings and revisions of\nexisting works that continue to appear, both in the\nUS and the UK, it is difficult to see why Green chose\nto go back to 1960 as a point of departure, unless\none takes into account the publication of the <em>Barnhart\nDictionary of New English Since 1963</em> (1973)\nand its second edition (1980) and assumes that this\nbook was intended to compete with them; certainly,\n<em>Neologisms</em> hasn't patch on Barnhart's books.  The\nOxford work, however, gives a great deal of useful\ninformation, largely, I imagine, because Oxford's\ncitation files are probably more extensive than\nGreen's.  It is instructive to compare the treatment\nof an entry from each book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neologisms<br>\nhigh five n.

By 1980 it was\nalso being used widely in baseball, especially to\nwelcome a player to the plate after a home run\n(and in this respect is similar to the hugs and\nother celebratory gestures used by British football\nplayers).  Television exposure soon made it a\nfashionable gesture among young people generally;\nwhat ensured its eventual importation to the\nUK was its adoption by the Teenage Mutant Turtles\n(in the form <em>high-three</em>, since Turtles do not\nhave fingers) as a jubilant greeting.  All that\ntouched off a wild celebration of hugs, high-fives\nand champagne spraying.</p>\n<p><em>USA Today</em> 14 Oct. 1987, p. 1</p>\n<p>A month has passed since the election and still\nRepublicans and Democrats are high-fiving.</p>\n<p><em>Maclean's</em> 2 Apr. 1990, p. 11</p>\n<p>So with a flying leap and a double high-five the\ntwo teammates celebrated the start of a new\nseason.</p>\n<p><em>Sports Illustrated</em> Dec. 1990,p. 16</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The differences in length and fullness are obvious.\nThe stated purpose of the <em>ODNW</em>, as set forth\nin the Preface, is “to provide an informative and\nreadable guide to about two thousand high-profile\nwords and phrases which have been in the news\nduring the past decade.”  Green, on the other hand,\ndescribes a different purpose in his Introduction,\nto wit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to encompass as wide as pertinent a range of\nvocabulary, the sole proviso being that the word\nor usage has entered the language in the last\nthirty years....  The basic qualification for inclusion\nhas been that the language in question has\nentered the mainstream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, Green cannot be faulted for offering more\nsuccinct entries, especially when the further comment\nin <em>ODNW</em> indicates a difference in purpose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The best one can hope to do in a book of this\nkind is to take a snapshot of the words and senses\nwhich seem to characterize our age and which a\nreader in fifty or a hundred years' time might be\nunable to understand fully (even if these words\nwere entered in standard dictionaries) without a\nmore expansive explanation of their social, political,\nor cultural context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While neither editor deserves high fives for lucid\nexposition, the message is that different targets\nwere being aimed at, and, unless one wishes to have\nboth books, the choice between them may be\nthought to remain an open one.  Still, I am nagged\nby inadequacies in Green's definition of <em>high-five</em>,\nwhich suggests that each individual might be simply\nclapping his hands together, and I am bothered by\nthe <em>ODNW's</em> failure to note the date of entry into\nthe language, saying that the earliest use of the term\ndates to 1979; I think that Green is right to hint at\nthe fact that the gesture preceded its use in sport:\nmy guess is that <em>slap five</em> arose among black teenagers\nor, perhaps, musicians as a form of greeting, approval,\nfarewell, and the like and was later carried\nover into sports (perhaps, as the <em>ODNW</em> suggests, by\nDerek Smith), where it became <em>high five</em>.  It seems\nunlikely that we shall ever know for sure.</p>\n<p>One question is raised by the statement in the\n<em>ODNW:</em> Why should contemporary users need or\nwant information expressly prepared for readers\nfifty or a hundred years hence?  The question is, of\ncourse, specious: the book is available now, for all to\nsee, and if one does not need or want the more replete\nversion, the “abridged” style of <em>Neologisms</em>\nmay well suffice.  Personally, I like to see as much\ndiscussion of the meaning, sense development, and\norigin of a term as I can find, but one must sacrifice\nthat to get a longer list of entries.  Also, one will find\n<em>jet set</em> in <em>Neologisms</em>, because it was coined after\n1960; but it is not in the <em>ODNW</em> because it was\ncoined before 1980.  Both list <em>Filofax</em> (<em>Neologisms</em>\nholding that the trade mark was registered in 1941,\nthe <em>ODNW</em> says the early thirties), and, as expected,\nthe latter includes several subentries (e.g., <em>Filofiction</em>,\nwhich indicates not only the productivity of\n<em>Filo</em>- as a prefix but the metaphoricity of the element)\nand six citations; <em>Neologisms</em>, in its short entry\nand one citation, leaves the user to derive what he\ncan about the metaphoric uses of the word.</p>\n<p>I have not taken the trouble to research the accuracy\nof the information given in these books, but\nI did note that <em>grody (to the max)</em>, which is not in\n<em>Neologisms</em>, is described in the <em>ODNW</em> as “US teenagers'\nslang”; while that might be technically correct,\nI have evidence that leads me to believe that it\noriginated in the slang of Hawaiian teenagers, and\nwhile no American would dispute the nationality of\nHawaiians, responsibility should be laid at the door\nof the real culprits.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
