Tony Percy writes that in addition to Dismal Desmond the Oxford English Dictionary lists “Dismal Jimmy, and also Moaning Minnie. Wet-leg is to be found (with a famous citation from D. H. Lawrence), but it does not offer Willy Wetleg as such….And what about Hooray Henry—are you familiar with him…? Does Doubting Thomas count?” (For the last, see John 20:26-29.) My fellow columnist Mat Coward contributes another <em>John:</em> “In London, traditionally (or perhaps proverbially), male strangers are addressed as 'John'. In a busy pub, the barman might catch your eye: 'You being served, John?' In practice, Londoners use usually use 'Mate' like the rest of us in these islands, but John lingers on.”11 And California law-school professor Steven R. Finz writes that Sephardic Jews speaking the dialect of Spanish called Ladino accord those “entitled to special respect, such as the family matriarch or patriarch,…the Frenchified titles of <em>M'syoo</em> or <em>Madame</em>. So a young boy who acts too big for his breeches may be called or referred to as M'syoo Guevo, translated roughly as 'Sir Egg.'” Finz further informs us that “The subject of many jokes among Sephardics is a fictional character named Djo-ha', who thinks he is smart, but obviously is not. When a know-it-all pontificates, he may be chided with the remark Avlo' Djoha', which means 'Djo-ha' has spoken.'”</p>\n<h1></h1>",
