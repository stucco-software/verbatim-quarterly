Daniel Fenning's <em>Royal\nEnglish Dictionary</em> in 1761 inadvertently omitted the word\n<em>uncle</em> and a succession of dictionaries after his had the same\ntell-tale gap.

Seems straightforward enough.\nNeed to check a couple of cross-referencesâand the Latin\nname.  These scientific names in Australia seem to be almost as\nunreliable as vernacular names.  Snakes called <em>Demansia</em> a while\nago are <em>Pseudonaja</em> now.  A pretty little green bird called a\n<em>greenie</em> or <em>chickowee</em> used to be officially <em>Meliphaga</em> and is now\n<em>Lichenostomus</em>, and three species of Australian magpies,\nbecause they were found to interbreed, are now one species\nwith the old specific names retained as varietal names, so that\nSouth Australia's emblem, the white-backed magpie, <em>maggie</em> to\nhis friends, is in full dress <em>Gymnorhina tibicens hypoleuca</em>.  So\nback to <em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em>.</p>\n<p>First we put to one side, as a separate problem, the\n<em>quinine bush (Alstonia constricta)</em> and concentrate on the\nquinine-<em>tree</em>.  A useful up-to-date guide to botanical names is\nJean Galbraith's <em>Collins Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of\nSouth-East Australia</em>, so we try that for <em>quinine-tree</em>.  It is there\nalong with another alternative name, <em>cracker-bush</em>, but the\nbotanical name is given as <em>Petalostigma glabrescens</em> (not\n<em>quadriloculare</em>); there is no mention of horse-radish trees.  We\ngo to the new <em>Macquarie Dictionary</em>.  It does include <em>horse-radish\ntree</em> but identifies it as <em>Moringa pterygosperma</em>; it does\nnot mention quinine-trees or cracker-bushes.  <em>The Australian\nEncyclopaedia</em> (the older and fuller 1956 edition) is probably\nthe source of the entry for <em>quinine-tree</em> in the first edition of\nmy dictionary; it also identifies <em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em> as\n<em>quinine-tree</em> but adds the names <em>crab-tree, native quince</em>, and\n<em>emu-apple</em>, mentioning that all these names are shared by other\nplants.  <em>The Australian Pocket Oxford Dictionary</em> already has an\nentry for <em>emu-apple</em> but calls it <em>Owenia acidula</em> (also called\n<em>native nectarine</em> or <em>native peach</em>).  It doesn't have <em>crab-tree</em>.  The\n<em>Macquarie</em> agrees with it about <em>emu-apple</em> but doesn't have\n<em>crab-tree</em> either.  Galbraith can't be referred to for <em>Owenia</em>\nbecause it is not a south-eastern plant.</p>\n<p><em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</em> gives <em>quinine-tree</em>\nas an alternative name for three separate trees.  One is\nthe <em>horse-radish tree</em> (which is where we came in), but\nreference to its entry reveals that it refers to two trees.  One of\nthem does have the generic name <em>Moringa</em>, but it is an East\nIndian tree <em>(M. oleifera)</em>; the other is Australian, but it has the\ngeneric name <em>Codonocarpus</em>.  The other two references are to\n<em>hop tree</em> (an American tree) and <em>native quince</em>âwhich does\nindeed lead us back to the Australian tree and the name\n<em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em>.  But is their information up to\ndate?  The search goes on.  There are botanists to write to,\nlibrary lists of taxonomical names to consult.  But sooner or\nlater a decision must be reached and all the available information\ncondensed into an allowable line or two before the next\nword is attacked.</p>\n<p>And, similarly condensing my newsletter in a line or so,\nyou will be patient next time you find one of those apparently\nvague but in fact very precise dictionary definitions of the kind\n'any of various Australian trees or shrubs.'</p>",
