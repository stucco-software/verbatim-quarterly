The four roots <em>SRS, HRM, ZBL</em>, and <em>KDŠ</em> will\nserve as illustrations.  The word <em>SaRiS</em> means both\n'eunuch' and 'governmental official,' the semantic shift\nbeing obvious to anyone familiar with the social structure\nof the ancient East.  A similar process affected the\nroot <em>HRM</em>, the Arabic cognate of which is the source\nof English <em>harem</em>.  Originally meaning 'consecrate,' the\nverb <em>HaRaM</em> eventually took on the meanings 'excommunicate'\nand 'forfeit' in a semantic development\nthat is transparent.</p>\n<p>Quite a different type of semantic shift is demonstrated\nin the root <em>ZBL</em>, from which arise both <em>ZeBuL</em>\n'exalted' and <em>ZeBeL</em> 'manure.'  Here, neither reflex\nseems to represent the original meaning of the root,\nand, though there is still considerable scholarly disagreement,\na possible explanation is that the core\nmeaning is 'piled up.'  If this hypothesis is correct,\nthen the two divergent meanings simply reflect what\nwas piled up.  And this type of divergence is exactly\nwhat occurred within the root <em>KDŠ</em>, resulting in the\ncontrast between <em>KoDeŠ</em> 'holy' and <em>KeDeŠah</em> 'prostitute.'\nIn all likelihood, the original meaning of <em>KDŠ</em>\nwas 'taboo,' and the two descendants represent different\ntaboos.  Moreover, it is interesting to note in this\nregard that Latin <em>meretrix</em> 'harlot' is built on the\nethically neutral base <em>mer(e)</em>- 'earn,' which in Classical\nLatin meant both 'merit' and 'demerit.'</p>\n<p>And while we are on the subject of multilingual\nhomonymous antonyms, perhaps it is well to conclude\nwith an example from Chinese: the currently omnipresent\n<em>kungfu</em>, with identical tones and identical\ncharacters, actually translates as 'task; accomplishment'\nand as 'leisure'!</p>\n<h1></h1>",
