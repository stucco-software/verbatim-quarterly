How often, before deciding, with some\nhesitation, to use a current political catchword or cliché,\nhas one said to oneself, “I wonder how that originated,\nwhat its real meaning is (or was), and whether, if I\nknew, I would still be prepared to use it”?  Well, now I\nshall consult <em>Safire</em>.  Perhaps one day <em>Safire</em> will itself\nenter the political vocabularly and have an entry of its\nown in Safire, for never did a blurb quote a sillier\ncommendation than that of <em>Newsweek:</em> “the definitive\nwork on the subject.”  The mark of a great dictionary is\nthat no edition is definitive: there will, I doubt not, be a\nday when <em>Safire,</em> like <em>Liddell and Scott,</em> will reach its\nninth edition.</p>\n<p>By being called a “political dictionary” and relegating\nto a subtitle the expression “the new language of\npolitics,” the book avoids defining, and thereby limiting,\nits field.  The heart of it consists of neologisms, invented\nor imported words that previously had no meaning at\nall, such as <em>mugwump</em> (from Natick (American Indian)\nmugquomp), or words which existed as proper names\nbefore but since a certain event have become generic\nterms, such as <em>Watergate</em> (for 'scandal unsuccessfully\ndenied') derived from the hotel building in Washington,\nD.C. Curiously, these specific proper names can spawn\na whole vocabulary—the tribe of words compounded\nwith -<em>gate</em> and signifying various implied scandals or\nwith -<em>nik</em> and intended to recall the <em>sputnik</em>.  Incidentally,\nwhy does <em>Safire</em> not have that most precious\nRussism, <em>apparatchik</em>?</p>\n<p>Then there are phrases which have a literal meaning\nin themselves but which have become clichés, used\nby those of whom not one in a thousand could identify\nthe occasion which first gave them currency.  Such is\n<em>hundred days</em> used to mean 'any dynamic, or even just\nany, initial period of a government,' with no conscious\nallusion to Napolean I's 1815 episode—a good example\nof the way in which a cliché, cut completely loose from\nits allusive origin, can with use become so general as to\nbe no longer evocative.  On the other hand, one can have\ndirect quotations which always remain such and are\nmeaningless to anyone who does not know the original\ncontext.  I remember being puzzled by Wedgwood Benn\nreferring to himself, in a speech in the House of Commons\nin the late 1950s, as “one of a hundred flowers,”\nbecause I had not then heard the Mao Tse-Tung saying.\nA special case is quotation of part of a well-known\nproverb, e.g., “changing horses” used in a sense determined\nby its context in the proverb against changing\nhorses while crossing a stream.</p>\n<p>Much, if not all, language is metaphor, and metaphor,\nbeing an effective rhetorical weapon if well handled,\nis a fruitful source of political vocabulary and\npolitical humour.  The examples are legion: <em>caretaker,\nsteamroller, gag, passing the torch,</em> and <em>domino theory</em>\nare among them, though <em>whip</em> (abbreviation of the\nfoxhunting term <em>whipper-in</em>) is not metaphorical in the\nsense often erroneously supposed.  Sometimes perfectly\ngeneral metaphors of immortal applicability, such as\n<em>whirlwind campaign</em> or <em>whispering campaign,</em> have\nacquired a special historical application in the politics of\na particular country; Safire often, as in these instances,\ninstructively documents the relevant American occasion.\nAn English instance is the connection of <em>finger on the\ntrigger</em> with the British 1951 general election and Winston\nChurchill.</p>\n<p>This last is one of the cases where an English\nexpression has migrated to the States, rather than vice\nversa, assuming there the more technological form <em>finger\non the button,</em> but an English user of <em>Safire</em> will be\nimpressed—and not, I think, mistakenly, just because\nSafire is himself American—with the volume of originally\nnative American political language which has been\nimported and naturalized, without acknowledgment or\nconsciousness, in Britain.  There is something about the\nAmerican style of speech, of humour, and of politics\nwhich predisposes to the creation of apt and striking\nexpressions.  What would we do without <em>carpetbagger</em> or\n<em>hats in the ring</em>?  Incidentally, is <em>gravy train</em> (which\nstrangely is not in <em>Safire</em>) American?</p>\n<p>Even, however, with expressions of European origin,\nSafire has astonishingly few lapses from accuracy\nand perception.  I noticed <em>snake in the tunnel,</em> meaning\n'an exchange rate limited to fluctuate up and down\nbetween close margins.'  <em>Safire</em> not only distinguishes\nthe true ('line on a graph') from the false ('snake in the\ngrass') origin of the metaphor, but notes the peculiar fact\nthat we have now replaced the <em>tunnel</em> by the snake itself\nand talk about “entering the snake.”</p>\n<p>Beyond all the above categories, <em>Safire</em> includes\nstraightforward albeit neologistic terms for American\nand other political inventions (e.g., <em>New Deal, Medicare,\nPeace Corps</em>) and even has articles on quite general\npolitical concepts, linguistically viewed, such as <em>Conservative,\ncard metaphors, new economics, sports metaphors,\nmost-favored nation</em>.  This stretches the subject\nmatter to the extreme but makes the dictionary more\nvaluable as a students' companion, especially in United\nStates history.</p>\n<p>The articles themselves are written in excellent and\nperspicuous English—which makes all the more curious\nthe revelation in the Introduction that the lexicographer,\na journalist by profession, is fully capable of the gravest\njournalistic crimes against language, especially in the\nmisuse and inadmissible mixing of metaphors.  He really\nought not to write about “stereotypes that <em>trigger</em>\napproval or hatred” or how “the choice of a word can\n<em>crystallize a mood</em> and turn it to action” nor speak of\n“the use of <em>Hottentots</em> as a <em>symbol</em> of underdeveloped\nnations.”  Perhaps there have been two (or more) hands\nat work, or is this just the mark of the poacher turned\ngamekeeper?</p>\n<p>I wonder if there is room for an <em>English</em> political\ndictionary.</p>\n<p><em>[J. Enoch Powell, House of Commons]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
