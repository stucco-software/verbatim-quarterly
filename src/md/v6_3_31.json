Under <em>degrees of murder</em> there is a\ndescriptive entry that gives one example but not much\nclarification.  A dictionary of such concision cannot be reviewed\non the basis of its inclusions—nor criticized for its\nomissions—but, within such a small compass one should be\nable to expect consistency.  No small problem is created by the\nlisting (in Appendix A) of Common-law Crimes, for there are a\nfew items there that look interesting, yet entries for them are\nnot in the book: <em>mistreatment of corpses, escape</em>, and <em>contraceptivism</em>\nare three.  Another, <em>barratry</em> is given only a\npartial definition.  The best thing that can be said is that if the\nterm sought is not sophisticated in nature you may find a\nsatisfactory definition in this book.
