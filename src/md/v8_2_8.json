Listing “over 178,000 entries,” it is somewhat\nless complete than Gale Research Company's <em>Initialisms\n&amp; Acronyms Dictionary,</em> which contains “over\n211,000 entries,” with an additional 13,000 in a <em>Supplement</em>.\nA complementary volume to the Gale work is\n<em>Reverse Abbreviations...</em>, in which one can find the\nabbreviations if the full form of the term is known.

For\nexample, “American Eponyms, Nicknames, and Sobriquets”\nlists less than two pages' worth of items like\n<em>American Historical Painter:</em> Emmanuel Lentzé, and\n<em>American Prose-Poetry Novelist:</em> Thomas Wolfe.  “Birth-stones—Ancient\nand Modern,” “Capitals of Nations,\nProvinces, Places, and States,” “Civil and Military Time\nSystems Compared,” “Nations of the World and Nationalities,”\n“Superlatives” (starting with <em>Africa's Easternmost\nCity</em> and ending with <em>Youngest Province)</em>, and\n“Winds of the World.”  However useful these may be,\nthey have no abbreviations associated with them, and it\nis unclear why they have been included.</p>\n<p>Turning to the main text of the book, we found\nmissing such items as <em>ILA,</em> International Linguistic Association,\n<em>BAAL,</em> British Association for Applied Linguistics,\nand others.  Included is <em>ADI,</em> American\nDocumentation Institute, the former name (till about\n1966, as far as we can recall) of the <em>ASIS,</em> American\nSociety for Information Science, but with no indication\nthat the name has been out of use for 15 years.  That is to\nsay, the abbreviation ought to be in for bibliographic\nand other reasons, but its defunct status should be\nnoted.</p>\n<p>Although entitled <em>Abbreviations Dictionary,</em> it contains,\neven in the main part of the book, a great deal of\nmaterial that has nothing to do with abbreviations.  Some\nof these are just plain silly (<em>Asia's big five:</em> elephant,\nleopard, rhinoceros, tiger, water buffalo; <em>porteños:</em>\n(Spanish—port people)—in Argentina means the people\nof Buenos Aires and in Chile those of Valparaiso), others\nof such strange provenance that one wonders how anyone\nlooking for them could expect them to be in this\nbook (<em>Portage La Prairie Girls:</em> Correctional Centre for\nWomen at Portage La Prairie, Manitoba).  Among the\nabbreviations we find <em>poop.:</em> nincompoop, and <em>ZZZ-ZZZ-ZZZ:</em>\nsawing or snoring (cartoonist symbol).  With a\nheavy interlarding of such extraneous matter—including\nstage names, pseudonyms, and other paraphernalia—\noccupying about 30 per cent of the book, the actual\nnumber of entries is closer to 125,000; moreover, our\ncount showed about 100,000 entries (average of 100 per\npage times 966 pages), not the 178,000 claimed.  Thus,\nthe number of actual abbreviations listed seems to be\nabout 70,000.</p>\n<p>Withal, the book contains much useful information\nand is quite handy and compact.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
