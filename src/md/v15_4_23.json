For example, here is one that I have\nslightly titivated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mark had now got his first <em>taste</em> of women, and it\nwas a <em>taste</em> that was to show many developments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fowler points out that the <em>taste</em> Mark got first was an\n'experience'; the <em>taste</em> that showed developments was\nan 'inclination.'  (It was a first taste of <em>print</em> that Mark\ngets in Fowler, if you are wondering about that titivation.)\nThe technical name for the device is <em>polyptoton</em>.</p>\n<p>In other words, what happens is something like\nthe legerdemain of a magician's now-you-see-it-now-you-don't.\nDid you catch my <em>alls</em> in the first paragraph,\nby the way?  Let's look as a few other choice\nspecimens I have bagged:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is <em>dangerous</em> to mess around with Ouija boards\n... and it is <em>dangerous</em> to condone them.</p>\n<p>The first <em>dangerous</em> means 'harmful,' while the second\nmeans 'irresponsible.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Pretty</em> girls finish first, which is <em>pretty</em> unfair to\nothers.</p>\n<p>The <em>pretty</em> pousse café is <em>pretty</em> hard to pour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the last two examples an adjective switches to an\nadverb.  An ultimate epitome of the case: “She's pretty\npretty.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sixty-five is just as <em>safe</em> as fifty-five, so it's <em>safe</em> to\nallow the faster speed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or to give equal time, as it were:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>55 is <em>safer</em> than 65 mph, so it is <em>safer</em> to keep the\nlimit at 55.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a nice touch of political legerdemain here,\nyou'll note, when the first <em>safe(r)</em> changes before our\nvery eyes from having a physical connotation to a\nsocio-political one.</p>\n<p>There is a lovely example in <em>Fowler</em> about <em>government</em>,\nwhich shows how slack political phraseology\ncan turn out to be (we just dropped a <em>False Scent</em>—no\ncomma between the qualifiers of <em>phraseology</em>— see below)\na black beast in any era; obviously the beast was\nrampaging even in Fowler's golden days.  We'll bring\nthings up to date by presenting his example in modern\ndress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many third-world countries are virtually subject to\nour American democratic <em>government</em>, but such\n<em>government</em> has generally been held back by Congress\nfrom taking any decisive action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds fair enough, surely?  Ah, but you see there is a\nsubtle quick-change there, and, these days, we should\nwonder whether it was intentional or just imprecise\ngrammar.  The first <em>government</em> really means 'governance'\nwhile the second means 'governing body.'  True,\nthere is an acceptable synonymity here but it is not to\nbe used in the same sentence.\nAnd how about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must indeed all <em>hang</em> together, or... we shall\nall <em>hang</em> separately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such sloppiness can indeed become rich fare for the\nSupreme Court.</p>\n<p>Now we come to those delightful <em>False Scents</em>.</p>\n<p>They are sly.  By all means read Fowler's delightful\nstatement of affairs about <em>False Scents</em>—he generates a\nwonderfully, though quite unwitting, humorous cameo\nof writer and reader virtually calling each other fools.\nThe reader wins because he is right—it is up to the\nwriter to ensure that the reader should not be given\nany <em>False Scents</em>.  Here are two additional ones to the\nfour examples Fowler gives that cause a reader to go\ndown the wrong track in a sentence, ending in a sort of\ndouble-take:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arthur found, after taking a wrong turning and\ngoing right past the house, and having looked for it\ncarefully the day before, that he had left his pen\nand briefcase at home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And we all thought he was going to find his dream\nhouse—or perhaps a million-dollar baby in a five-and-ten-cent\nstore.  Or as Fowler would (perhaps) say,\nArthur found a noun clause instead of a good solid\ncommon noun he could mortgage or marry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Leaning forward, with her hand shielding the\nstrong sunlight from her eyes, she was looking,\nArthur thought, particularly beautiful and poised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are beginning to get angry with Arthur.  We all\nthought she was looking for him at least; certainly not\nfor a mere predicate adjective.</p>\n<p>Watch for more Favorite Grammatical Games in\nfollowing issues of VERBATIM.</p>",
