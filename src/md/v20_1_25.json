They wanted to take in the bullfights, so they put up in a little hotel near the bullring. With a phrase book in hand, they went to the hotel restaurant for breakfast and, seeing <em>huevos fritos</em> on the menu, ordered those. When the order came, it was a bit different from what the Americans were used to, but the eggs were so big and juicy and tasty that the Gringos ordered them again for their second day's breakfast. And the third day, too. But the third time the <em>huevos</em> were about a third the size of those served the first two days, and there was only one for each of them. So one of them called over the waiter and complained, “Say, how come you bring us these dried-up little eggs and only one for each of us when we've been getting big, juicy ones about five times this size?” The waiter shrugged and said, “Hey, man, the bulls can't lose all the time, you know.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a grisly variation on this joke in the movie <em>Salvador</em>.</p>\n<p>I don't know whether <em>blanquillos</em> has replaced <em>huevos</em> for eggs in colloquial Mexican and New Mexican Spanish simply because when <em>huevos</em> came to mean primarily 'testicles,' both eggs and testicles being culinary items, a new word was needed for eggs, as demonstrated by the joke, or whether the substitution arose from prudery. If prudery is the cause, the substitution is analogous to the American replacement of <em>cock</em> by <em>rooster</em>, and it's as if Europeans, both English- and Spanish-speaking, became oddly prudish about poultry when they came to America.</p>\n<p>As far as I know, <em>blanquillo</em> is not in common use in the Spanish of the Mother Country, nor, I believe, is <em>rooster</em> in Britain, where a male chicken is still called a <em>cock</em>. <em>Huevos</em> for 'testicles,' however is usual in Iberian Spanish. An American friend of a famous Spanish bullfighter once told me that the matador had complained that when a bull lowers its head to charge, its horns are at about the height of a man's <em>huevos</em>. “I don't know how many times I've had mine sewn back on,” the bullfighter said.</p>\n<p>[William H.
