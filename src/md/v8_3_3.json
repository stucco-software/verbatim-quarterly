Brook, (Barnes &amp; Noble, 1981), 207pp.</p>\n<p>I have two problems with this book.  The first is the\noutrageous price of the American edition, for the 5¼” × 8½”\nbook cannot contain above 70,000 words (the last 35 pages are\nnotes, bibliography, and index—and a rather scanty index, at\nthat).  The other is that the author, though writing about\nEnglish, has chosen to all but ignore any American sources.  Oh,\nyes, there are Leo Rosten <em>(Joys of Yiddish)</em>, Greenough and\nKittredge, and a handful of others (more honored in the\nbibliography than in the text or notes), but the preponderance\nof authors and scholars cited are British, as if the Americans\nhad made little or no contribution.  Not even a single American\ndictionary (unless you count <em>Joys of Yiddish</em>, which is certainly\nnot in the same class as <em>Webster, Worcester, Random House,\nAmerican Heritage, World</em> and other works) is so much as\nmentioned in the text.  My reaction is prompted less by\nchauvinism than by the feeling that a modern work that cites\namong American sources nothing later than Mencken's <em>American\nLanguage</em> is not only insular but stuffily old-fashioned.  No\nbook about English can, I believe, ignore the contributions\nmade by American English, yet Brooks, Professor Emeritus of\nEnglish Language and Medieval English Literature at the\nUniversity of Manchester, has done just that.  And the resulting\nwork is quite lopsided.</p>\n<p>There is nothing here that cannot easily be found elsewhere\nin the dozens of books published in the last two decades\nabout the language and, indeed, in a decent etymological\ndictionary.  The approach is sober and unutterably dull and dry.\nPerhaps more words are treated than in Simeon Potter's <em>Our\nLanguage</em>, but that and Potter's other books sparkled with\ngood, interesting writing.  Brooks gives the impression that he is\nfrequently boring himself.  His arid, matter-of-fact style can be\nseen in the following, mercifully brief passage, typical of the\nbook and selected more or less at random:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Elevation of meaning is less common than degeneration.\nWe sometimes find divergent changes, with two words\nof similar meaning developing in opposite directions.\n<em>Childish</em> and <em>juvenile</em> have sunk; <em>child-like, boyish</em> and\n<em>youthful</em> have risen.  <em>Service</em> is something that we are\nproud to render, but <em>servility</em> is a quality that we do\nnot want to possess.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Readers who do not expect more than this—the essential\nfacts of language and exemplary etymologies merely written\nout at length instead of being presented in the telegraphic form\nof a reference book—will not be disappointed.  As for this\nreviewer, I can see nothing wrong in presenting the same old\nmaterial, but I insist that a new work should reflect something\nnew and should, at least, be interestingly written.  Alas,\nBrooks's book may do more to destroy a budding interest in\nlanguage than to nurture it.</p>\n<p><em>—Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
