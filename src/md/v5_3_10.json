Stearn with J.\nL.L. Smith, (St. Martin's Press, 1972), xii + 391pp.</p>\n<p>Stearn's credentials are impeccable: he is a botanist of\nthe Natural History section of the British Museum, a doctor of\nscience, a Fellow of the Linnaean Society, and author of the\nhighly informative volume <em>Botanical Latin</em>.  In revising the\nearlier work of A. W. Smith (a highly informed amateur), he\nwas forced to be excruciatingly selective, for, since Linnaeus\nbegan the systematic description of plants in the 18th century,\nbotanical nomenclature has expanded so drastically that\nits vocabulary includes more than a half-million items, half of\nthem concerning the flowering plants gardeners attempt to\nraise.  (This word list is so vast that not even <em>Hortus III</em> attempts\nto contain it all.) Dr. Stearn's solution is elegant: he\nhas chosen almost 6000 terms basic to even the most enterprising\ngardener, providing necessary etymologies and extremely\nclear but simple explanations.  To aid a gardener new to the\nintricacies of botanical terminology, he has provided a remarkably\nclear but brief introduction explaining the necessity\nfor a single international term for each plant family, genus,\nand species; in addition, he has classified the modes of plant-name\norigins beginning with those from pre-Christian\nGreece, illustrated the procedures involved in using binomial\nnomenclature, and added a brief grammar and syntax relating\nto the <em>International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</em>.  His\nword list is so complete that a gardener meeting an unfamiliar\nbotanical name (say, <em>Maclura pomifera</em>) can readily learn\nthat it refers to a species of Osage orange (named after the\nAmerican geologist William Maclure) that bears fruit as well\nas flowers.</p>\n<p>The botanical-to-common section of the book, occupying\nthe first 336 pages, is followed by a highly praiseworthy\n“Introduction to Vernacular Names,” a selective bibliography,\nand an index of 3000 vernacular names and botanical\ncounterparts in parallel columns.</p>\n<p>At this point, the usefulness of the volume declines precipitately\nfor the American.  Smith was an Englishman transplanted\nto American, and his experience was chiefly British;\nStearn is also English.  As a result, the vernacular names are\nalmost exclusively British.  The fault is probably Stearn's; as a\nprofessional botanist, he cannot be expected to be at home in\nvernacular nomenclature.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, his list is not entirely useful even for\nBritish common names.  Case in point: the genus <em>Impatiens</em>\ncontains at least three species, all grown in both Britain and\nUSA: <em>Impatiens noli-tangere</em>, known commonly in England\nand America as balsam and touch-me-not; <em>Impatiens sultana</em>\nand <em>Impatiens holstii</em>, known in England as dizzy Lizzy or\nbusy Lizzie and in America (erroneously) as patient Lucy and\npatience.  In both countries it is also referred to correctly as\nimpatience and impatiens.  The Smith/Stearn/Smith volume\nlists the first but omits balsam from the vernacular list.  It does\nnot mention the second and third species either botanically or\nvernacularly, despite their very strong popularity on both sides\nof the Atlantic.  Ditto for <em>Schlumbergera truncata</em> (Thanksgiving\ncactus), <em>Plectranthus australis</em> (Swedish ivy), <em>Senecio\nmikanioides</em> (German ivy), etc.</p>\n<p>If this analysis of the Smith/Stearn/Smith volume has a\nmoral, it is this: publishers should not merely add a gardening\ntitle to their lists.  St. Martin's should realize, despite their\nEnglish origins, that a book by an English botanist specifically\nstating that the volume “includes most of the genera...\nbeing cultivated in the British Isles, Germany, the Netherlands,\nand Scandinavia” is hardly a book for most American\ngardeners.</p>\n<p>Thus, until the first three parts of the Smith/Stearn/Smith\nvolume are edited and reprinted with a thoroughly overhauled\nvernacular section, most avid American gardeners\nmust still unhappily await the ideal botanical-to-common\ndictionary.</p>\n<p><em>Howard G.
