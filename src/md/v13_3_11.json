Almost everybody knows a few words of\nthis language.  But those with a complete understanding\nare limited to a few thousand.  It is the language of\ncattle brands.  The practice of branding cattle for identification\nseems to have begun with the Moors in\nAfrica and carried with them when they invaded\nSpain.  The Spanish brought it to the New World.</p>\n<p>\\?\\The early Spanish and Mexican\nbrands were simply arbitrary marks with\nlittle or no meaning of their own.  Perhaps\nthe earliest New World cattle\nbrand was that belonging to Cortez.  It\nwas simply three crosses.</p>\n<p>Most brands consist of letters and/or numbers\nalong with a few arbitrary signs, such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bar         \\?\\<br>\nSlash    \\?\\<br>\nRail        \\?\\<br>\nBench    \\?\\<br>\nTwo Rails   \\?\\<br>\nRafter   \\?\\<br>\nStripe      \\?\\</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The position or structure of a letter determines its\nname.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tumbling R   \\?\\<br>\nRunning R    \\?\\<br>\nLazy R       \\?\\<br>\nDragging R   \\?\\<br>\nCrazy R      \\?\\<br>\nSwinging R   \\?\\<br>\nWalking R    \\?\\<br>\nRocking R    \\?\\<br>\nFlying R     \\?\\</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last two are a bit tricky.  If the are is not touching\nthe letter, the name changes.  \\?\\ is “quarter circle\nR,” and \\?\\ is “R quarter circle.”</p>\n<p>\\?\\ is simply “WR” but \\?\\ is “WR connected.”\n\\?\\ is “double R” and \\?\\ is “Box R.”</p>\n<p>By now you have probably deduced the principal\nsyntax rule of cattle brands.  Brands are read from left\nto right, from top to bottom, and from outside to\ninside.  \\?\\, \\?\\, \\?\\ are all “circle R.”</p>\n<p>There are a thousand stories about cattle brands.\nJ. Frank Dobie told one about a renegade long-horn\nwith a huge DEATH branded on both its sides.  The cantankerous\nanimal was avoided by men and other cattle\nalike.  It wandered alone in the desert for some\ntwenty years before it disappeared, presumably dead.</p>\n<p>A pastime among some cow people is the drawing\nof brands in the dirt and challenging others to name\nthem.  \\?\\ is not too hard; it is “H on T.”  Logically\n\\?\\ should be “Flying half circle diamond and a\nhalf,” but in reality it is “Fleur de Mustard.”  This\n\\?\\ is not “double cross” but “pigpen.”  And because\nthis brand \\?\\ means absolutely nothing, it is called\n“Quien sabe,” Spanish for 'I don't know.'  Brands that\ncan be read in two ways can lead to ceaseless\narguments.</p>\n<p>One consideration in selecting a brand is; Can\nit be easily changed.  \\?\\ could easily become\n\\?\\.  There is a story about a cattle rustler\nwho stole a herd of IC cattle and changed the brand to\n<em>ICU</em>.  But before he could dispose of them, they were\nstolen from him and the brand changed to <em>ICU2</em>.\nTo prevent this, some ranchers used big brands.</p>\n<p>One such was \\?\\ which covered the entire\nside of a cow.  It was registered as the “pothook”\nbrand, but it was known far and side as the “straddle\nbug.”  The trouble with this approach is that it\ndecreases the value of the hide.</p>\n<p>The <em>XIT</em> brand is commonly known as “Ten in\nTexas.”  It is said that this is because the ranch covered\nten counties in West Texas.  In truth it was so designed\nbecause it would be difficult to change.  The owners\nwere so proud they offered a reward to anyone who\ncould change the brand so that it could not be recognized.</p>\n<p>Naturally, somebody did it with the “Star\ncross” brand.</p>\n<p>\\?\\</p>\n<p>Brands lend themselves to puns.  <em>4D</em> inevitably\nbecame “Ford.”  Instead of being “Bar circle”</p>\n<p>—\\?\\ became “Bar none.”</p>\n<p>I had heard the story of \\?\\ (remember, a\ntwo lying on its back is a “Lazy 2”) a dozen times and\ndismissed it as a tall tale.  But a few years ago, just five\nmiles from where I live, I saw a cow, I am sure it was not\nbrand.  Since it was only one cow, I am sure it was not\na registered brand, but someone's idea of a practical\njoke.</p>",
