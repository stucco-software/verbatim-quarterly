When Cornwallis\nfound that help was not going to arrive because the French\nfleet under DeGrasse had barricaded the British from rescuing\nhim and his army, he decided to make a forced march north\nto join up with other British troops.  He assembled boats and\nhis choice of the assembled troops, and the assumption here\nis that the troops chosen to accompany him would be primarily\nBritish.  They attempted on October 16, 1781, to cross\nthe York River to Gloucester to head north but “a York River\nstorm came up” [having been in several York River storms, I\nknow that they can be devastating] and many of the boats\nwere blown down the river to the area that is now Guinea.\nThe men in these boats would have been British and would\nhave had a community of interests to hold them together.</p>\n<p>Cornwallis sued for surrender the next day.  The troops\nat Yorktown were soon moved to Williamsburg and subsequently\nwest into the Valley of Virginia, where the security\nseems to have become lax.  Many of these troops remained\nin the valley, especially in the Charlottesville area, and there\nwe do find some German dialects and many German and\nHessian names.</p>\n<p>The British soldiers who landed at what is now Jenkins'\nNeck, in Guinea, had no difficulty in settling down.  Having\na common background, similar interests, and a probable fear\nof being taken as prisoners of war, they are assumed to have\nremained in the area and to have maintained in this isolated\npart of the country their dialect, which they brought from\nEngland.  As the country government became more organized\nand was able to demand payment of taxes from these people,\nthey paid them in the coin with which they had been paid\nby Cornwallis: guineas; hence they became “Guineamen.”</p>\n<p>The principal surnames of those who still speak this dialect\nare Brown, Smith, West, Jenkins, Hall, Robins, Rowe,\nBelvin and Shackelford.  With the advent of the central school\nsystem, radio, and television, the dialect is fast disappearing\nand probably not more than two or three hundred people\nspeak it today. [<em>Raymond S.
