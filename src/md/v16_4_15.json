It was the cri de coeur of a single-minded\npatriot beset by the idea that the purity of his\nmother tongue was being corrupted by the Anglo-maniac\nleanings of his countrymen.  Disgustedly, he\npointed at words like <em>cockpit, bowling, snack</em>, and\nhundreds of others, constantly used by French technicians,\nsportsmen, youngsters—in fact, everybody.\nLest the national language be eventually supplanted\nby <em>le sabir atlantique</em> (the Atlantic pidgin), he urged\nthe government to set up a system of penalties to\ndivert the linguistic polluters from the path of sin.</p>\n<p>Feelings of bitterness did not keep the author\nfrom presenting his admonitions in an easily digestible\nstyle.  All the fire and brimstone were wrapped\nin a lighthearted tone and padded with humorous\nremarks.  The book became enormously popular, and\nthe term <em>Franglais</em> entered the world's dictionaries.\nBut most people happily went on introducing words\nlike <em>le workshop, le tour-operator</em> (they insist on the\nhyphen), <em>le self</em> (self-service restaurant), <em>le must</em> (the\nthing to wear), <em>le pick-up</em> (the truck or the record\nplayer, not the girl), <em>le hi-fi</em> (pronounce: “eefee”).\nEven now, it becomes a bit easier each day for an\nEnglish speaker to read a French newspaper.</p>\n<p>However, Etiemble's appeal caught on with the\npowers that were.  In 1966, only two years after the\npublication of the book, General de Gaulle, then\npresident of France, established a High Committee\nfor the Defence and the Expansion of the French\nLanguage.  Through subsequent legislation each government\ndepartment was equipped with one or several\nterminology commissions with the responsibility\nof compiling lists of “approved terms” in their\nrespective spheres.  The use of these terms is statutorily\nrequired, not only in official documents, but also\nin all business correspondence and advertising (including\nlabels, catalogues, waybills, etc.), employment\ncontracts, radio and television programs,\nnotices in public places, and certain schoolbooks.\nReplacing such a term by a foreign equivalent is a\npenal offense, and may cost the offender anything\nfrom $90 to $200.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Commissioner General for the\nFrench Language, a supervisory body, has recently\npublished a new edition of the <em>Dictionnaire des Né\nologismes Officiels</em>, which lists the 2,000-odd terms\nso far approved (plus some 400 “recommended”\nones whose use is obligatory for certain publications\nonly).  To judge from this batch, the purge is going to\nbe less radical than one would expect from a system\nprofessedly resting on the tenets of linguistic protectionism.\nIndeed, quite a few of the listed terms are\nidentical to their English counterparts (in spelling,\nthat is: this regime rarely interferes with pronunciation).\nExamples: <em>adobe</em> for 'adobe,' <em>management</em> for\n'management,' <em>drone</em> for '<em>drone</em>' (in military avionics).\nMore than that, the <em>Dictionnaire</em> gives its blessing\nalso to several words of blatantly English stock,\nsuch as <em>hall, drugstore</em>, and <em>pipeline</em> (pronounce:\npea-PLEAN), even including portmanteau words (<em>bit,\npixel</em>) and acronyms (<em>laser, radar</em>).</p>\n<p>Along with these outright borrowings came hybrids\ncomposed of an English root and a French suffix,\nsuch as <em>clonage</em> for 'cloning,' <em>scorer</em> for 'to score,'\n<em>nurserie</em> for 'nursery' ('fish-breeding plant'), and\n<em>supporteur/supportrice</em> for 'supporter.'  In some\ncases, slight spelling changes have been applied, but\nthe English origin remains unmistakable: <em>chalengeur</em>\nfor 'challenger,' <em>dribler</em> for 'to dribble,' <em>média</em> (mandatory\nplural: <em>médias</em>) for 'media,' <em>astronaute</em> for 'astronaut.'\n(The last term seems, in both languages, a\nrather hyperbolic denomination for a person who\ntravels less than two light-seconds away from his\nhome planet.  But then, it is modest compared to the\nRussian <em>cosmonaut</em>.)  Some of the <em>Dictionnaire's</em> Anglicisms\nhave undergone more drastic transcriptional\nsurgery, e.g. <em>gazole</em> for 'gas oil,' <em>fioul</em> for 'fuel'\n(oil), <em>roquette</em> for 'rocket,' <em>bipasse</em> for 'bypass.'</p>\n<p>All this seems a far cry from the uncompromising\noverhaul Etiemble must have hoped for.  To his\nmind, French was a rich enough language to meet\nany new requirements from domestic resources.  He\nmight even have snubbed the many <em>Dictionnaire</em> entries\ncreated by literal translation of the imagery embodied\nin the corresponding English term, as <em>souris</em>\nfor 'mouse' (of a personal computer) or <em>retombées</em>\nfor (nuclear) 'fallout.'  Application of this method to\ncompounds results in calques like <em>banque de données</em>\nfor 'data bank' or <em>atterrissage sur le ventre</em> for 'belly\nlanding.'  However, since French compounds tend to\nbe rather explicit, and their components are generally\nstrung together by all kinds of grammatical particles\n(conjunctions, prepositions, articles), this\nmethod often leads to tapewormish constructions,\nsuch as <em>espace extra-atmosphérique</em> for 'outer space'\nor <em>boucle en épingle à cheveux</em> for 'hairpin loop.'</p>\n<p>Etiemble would probably have warmed more\nreadily to entires which in no way derive from an\nEnglish model, like logiciel for 'software,' axénique\n('without foreign matter') for 'germfree,' or suramplificateur\nfor 'booster.'  The Dictionnaire offers\nmany such ingenious coinages but they generally\nlack the pithiness and sprightliness that enliven such\na great deal of scientific and technological terminology\nin English.  Vibreur sonore for 'buzzer,' tireur\nisolé ('lone rifleman') for 'sniper,' and mitraillage au\nsol ('machinegunning towards the ground') for\n'strafing' are of course correct, but they sound like\npunctilious definitions rather than handy appellations.\nEven more ponderous are exposition inter-professionnelle\nfor 'trade show,' transport maritime á\nla demande for 'tramping' (the activity of tramp\nsteamers), and véhicule lourd de dépannage for\n'wrecker.'  The heavyweight champion is perhaps\ncontrat á terme d'instrument financier for what they\ncall 'financial futures' at the Stock Exchange.  Unsur-prisingly,\nthe French law shows little patience for\nthe charming onomatopoeias which the technical\npeople have invented for audio equipment and its\ntantrums, like 'tweeter' and 'boomer,' or 'wow' and\n'hum.' The renderings imposed by the latter-day index\nexpurgatorius are, respectively, haut-parleur\nd'aigus (tolerated second choice: tuiteur), haut-parleur\nde graves (ditto: boumeur), pleurage ('weeping'),\nronflement ('snoring').</p>\n<p>To be sure, the Dictionnaire does not consist exclusively\nof naturalized or Frenchified alien words\nand wordy phrases of bureaucratic facture.  Many an\nentry had already had a life of its own before a ministerial\ndecree raised it to its present status.  Some of\nthem are real gems: tableur ('tabular operator') for\n'spreadsheet' is concise, precise, and original;\nbaladeur ('stroller') for 'walkman,' although basically\na loan translation, adds a fresh nuance to the\nimagery; best of all perhaps is ordinateur for 'computer,'\nthe French term (current since the 1960s,\nadopted by the Dictionnaire in 1983) meaning something\nlike 'methodically arranging agent.'  Since the\nmachine is not, as generally believed in former\nyears, a new kind of calculator but rather a high-speed\nsymbol manipulator, ordinateur hits the mark.</p>\n<p>Whatever the merits of all those novelties, the\nFrench seem to have a relaxed attitude to the disciplinary\naspects.  They use both prescribed and proscribed\nterms, depending probably on efficiency,\npersonal preferences, and 'what others do.'  In one\nrespect, however, they are unanimous.  They stick to\nan odd collection of English words which have a different\nmeaning or are nonexistent in English-speaking\ncountries.  As in Etiemble's days, they say smoking\nfor 'dinner jacket' and slip for 'underpants.'  The\nchoke in an automobile is still referred to as starter\n(the real starter is called démarreur), and a female\nradio or TV announcer as speakerine.  And they have\nlots of men in France: rugbymen, tennismen, taximen,\nrecordmen, comingmen, etc.  When the streets of\nParis were still enlivened by streetcars (French:\ntramways), there were even wattmen.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
