Is it at heart a morox?  It does not seem\nto qualify as double entendre.</p>\n<p>The onus for double entendre, particularly if risqué,\nproperly lies with the perceiver.  But who can\nresist a smirk when a female network broadcaster observes\nthat with respect to celibacy in the priesthood,\n“the pontiff remains firm.”  The howlers in my collection\nthat I most cherish, however, depend for their\ncharm on skewed syntax.</p>\n<p>My prize example was uttered by the incomparable\nCher, during a morning-show interview.  “It took\nme really a long time to sort what was going on in my\nmind out,” she said.  Her interviewer didn't bat an eye.</p>\n<p>Cher's gem stood unrivaled until I recently heard\na Monday Night Football savant announce to the nation\nthat despite confusion among the officials on the\nfield, a touchdown had indeed been scored, because\n“the plane of the ball broke the goal line.”  Technically,\nit is not a spoonerism.  Have such transpositions a\nname?</p>\n<p>And as I look at the last slip in my random handful,\nagain I encounter a classificatory conundrum:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No government can go against [the laws of economics]\nwith impunity and get away with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[William Gray Johnston, Boulder, Colorado]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
