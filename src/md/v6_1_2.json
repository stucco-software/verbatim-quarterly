From there it travels through the\n<em>pyloric</em> 'gatekeeper' <em>valve</em> into the <em>duodenum</em>, so named for\nits length of 'twelve' fingerbreadths.  Next is the <em>jejunum</em>\nwhich, during dissection, was most often found empty or\n'fasting.'  The <em>vagus</em> nerve 'wanders' extensively throughout\nthe body, innervating most of the gastro-intestinal tract.  And\nas if one 'belly' wasn't enough, the anatomists describe several\n<em>ventricles</em>, both in the heart and brain.</p>\n<p>The nomenclature of the genitourinary tract is further\nembellished.  Many people know that a <em>vagina</em> is a 'sheath'\nthat can envelop a “sword,” and that our word for the\nsurgical removal of the uterus, <em>hysterectomy</em>, and <em>hysteria</em>\nstem from the same root because hysteria was formerly attributed\nto uterine disturbances.  Naming the fleshy prominence\nover the pubic bone in women the <em>mons veneris</em> 'mountain of\nlove' indicates a certain romantic disposition among\nanatomists, but this is in contradistinction to the name for the\nnerve that transmits sensation from the genital region, the\n<em>pudendal</em> 'to be ashamed.'  Only grown-ups have <em>pubic</em> 'adult'\nhair; and although a woman has a <em>clitoris</em> 'little hill,' men\nhave <em>orchids</em> (the lesser known term for the 'testicles' based on\ntheir resemblance to orchid bulbs and more familiar to us in\nthe term denoting 'inflammation of the testes,' <em>orchitis</em>).  <em>Testes</em>\n(cognate with <em>testify</em>) bear 'witness' to manhood and virility,\nand reside in a literal, etymologically speaking, 'sack,' the\n<em>scrotum</em>.  Babies come from little seeds, we're told, but who\nwould think the seed was an 'acorn'?  Both the clitoris and\npenis have one: <em>glans</em>.</p>\n<p>If someone says you have <em>rocks in your head</em>, he may not\nbe far off from the truth.  The brain contains, among things\nother than dreams, 'sea monsters' (<em>hippocampus</em>), 'bridal\nchambers' (<em>thalamus</em>), 'almonds' (<em>amygdala</em>), 'olives,' a 'pine\ncone' <em>pineal gland</em>, and 'fruit stones' (<em>putamen</em>), all enclosed\nin a fibrous covering, the <em>dura mater</em> 'tough mother,' as the\nlongshoremen would say.  The <em>sagittal</em> suture line, which runs\nbrow to occiput in the skull, appears as though sliced through\nby an 'arrow.'  (Was this named by an anatomist related to\nWilliam Tell?)  And infants, whose minds aren't constricted\nby paradigms of abstract thinking, have 'fountains' <em>fontanelles</em>\non the tops of their heads.  Those of you with 'breasts'\non the brain will be glad to know there are two additional\n<em>mammary bodies</em> inside of everyone's head, and <em>mastoid processes</em>\non either side externally.</p>\n<p>Certain appellations show a particularly clever mind behind\nthem.  The colored irises of the eye are named after the\ngoddess of the rainbow, and the word <em>pupil</em> 'little girl, doll'\noriginated from the children's name for the tiny reflection of\noneself seen when looking closely at another's eyes.  The <em>sartorius</em>\nmuscle is found in the thigh and is used in sitting cross-legged\n'like a tailor' at work.  The <em>popliteal</em> 'ham' area is\nbehind the knee, and this association is found in our colloquial\nuse of the term <em>hamstrings</em>.  The strong cheek muscles\nwhich enable us to blow horns are called <em>buccinators</em>\n'trumpeters.'  And, my favorite, the midline indentation in\nthe upper lip, is termed the <em>philtrum</em> 'love potion.'</p>\n<p>Other epithets indicate a more abstract association.  The\n<em>hyoid</em> bone in the neck is 'U-shaped' (that is, like <em>upsilon</em>), the\n<em>sigmoid</em> colon is 'S-shaped' (like <em>sigma</em>) and the <em>deltoid</em> muscle\nin the shoulder is 'triangular' (like <em>delta</em>) in form.  There are\nseveral 'crescents' in our hands (<em>lunate</em> bones) and knees\n(<em>menisci</em>).</p>\n<p>The anatomists saw a variety of animal likenesses in a\ndiverse collection of bodily parts.  We bear 'goose feet' <em>pes\nanserinus</em> in a group of web-like muscles of the thigh.  The\nbase of the spine is curved like a 'cuckoo's bill' <em>coccyx</em>.  Just\nabove the <em>coccyx</em> is the <em>sacrum</em>, a 'sacred' bone because of its\nuse in sacrifice.  In this vicinity are the slender strands of\nnerves at the end of the spinal cord, the <em>cauda equina</em> 'horse's\ntail.'  There are 'earthworm-like' muscles in the hands <em>lumbricales</em>\nand a 'worm' in the brain (<em>vermis</em>).  'Goats' had their\nears pierced for identification, and the corresponding cartilaginous\nportion of our ears is designated the <em>tragus</em>.  The tiny\nhairs which grow from the ear canal are also called <em>tragi</em>.</p>\n<p>Foods are plentiful.  'Sesame seed-like' bones in the hands\nand feet (<em>sesamoids</em>), 'lentils' in the eyes (<em>lens</em>), 'beans' in the\nknees (<em>fabella</em>), and 'a small grape,' that fleshy hanging-drop\nin the back of the throat (<em>uvula</em>) join the other edibles already\nmentioned.</p>\n<p>Kitchen items abound.  We're walking collections of\n'forks' (<em>clavicles</em>), 'funnels' (<em>choana</em>, nasal passageways),\n'sieves' (<em>ethmoid</em> bones in the nose), 'flasks' (<em>ampulla</em>, part of\nthe intestines), 'a small pan' (<em>patella</em>, the kneecap), and even\n'vinegar cruets' (<em>acetabulum</em>, the hip-joint sockets).</p>\n<p>Other household objects are scattered about the body.\nWe have 'drawers' in the intestines (<em>haustra</em>), 'staircases' in\nthe ears (<em>scala</em>), and 'frames for wicker-work' in the feet (the\n<em>tarsal</em> bone).  Personal artifacts decorate our nooks and crannies.\nThere are 'brooches' (<em>fibula</em>, a leg bone), two kinds of\n'combs' (<em>crista</em> in the skullbones, and <em>pecten</em> in the intestines),\nand many 'purses' (<em>bursa</em>; cf. <em>bursitis</em>).</p>\n<p>When there's work to be done, we come furnished with\nthe tools of various trades: 'hammers' (<em>malleus</em>, an ear bone),\n'little hammers' (<em>malleolus</em>, an ankle bone), 'anvils' (<em>incus</em>, an\near bone), 'a handle' (<em>manubrium</em>, part of the breastbone),\n'pulleys' (<em>trochlea</em>, in several places), 'hooks' (<em>uncus</em>, in the\nbrain), 'sickles' (<em>falx</em> in the brain), and 'a plowshare' (<em>vomer</em>,\na nose bone).  But all work and no play certainly wouldn't be\nright, so we have a child's 'top' (<em>turbinates</em>, in the nose), 'bubbles'\n(<em>bulla</em>, in the nose), 'horns' (<em>cornu</em>, in several places),\nand 'a pale ball' (<em>globus pallidus</em> in the brain) to play with.</p>\n<p>For outdoor recreation, we may go horseback riding\nwith 'stirrups' (<em>stapes</em>, an ear bone) and 'bridle' (<em>frenulum</em> in\nthe mouth) in hand, or go sailing a 'boat' (<em>scaphoid</em>, a wrist\nbone) on 'a lake' (<em>lacuna</em>, in several places) under 'a bridge'\n(<em>pons</em> in the brain), confident in the sturdiness of our 'keel'\n(<em>carina</em>, in the lungs).  We might also look for 'shells' (<em>concha</em>\nin the nose, <em>cochlea</em> in the ears) along the way.</p>\n<p>And if we must go forth into combat, we're equipped\nwith 'helmet' (<em>galea</em>, part of the skullbone) and 'sword' (<em>xiphoid</em>,\nat the end of the breastbone), 'trumpet' (<em>salpinx</em>, the\nFallopian tubes) and 'shield' (<em>thyroid</em>).</p>\n<p>And when the anatomists ran out of images and names\nfor the numerous bones or arteries, for example, they would\nsimply call one the <em>Innominate</em> 'unnamed,' and still have the\nlast word.</p>\n<p>ERRATUM [<em>I</em> before <em>E</em> department]</p>\n<p>As a large number of readers have pointed out, John\nGummere's column appears regularly in <em>The</em> [Philadelphia]\n<em>Inquirer</em>, not, as reported earlier, The “Enquirer.”</p>",
