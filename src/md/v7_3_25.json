Times</em> please note) enough space to\nwrite in the answers, are packed with all kinds of word and\npicture puzzles, from crosswords (cryptic and normal),\nacrostics, logic games, cryptograms, and cartoon rebuses to\ncompetitions and other miscellaneous fun. Not everyone\nlikes every kind of puzzle, and there are quite a few to\nchoose from in a given month's selection. Certain old standbys\nappear in each issue, but each issue of <em>The 4 * Puzzler</em>\noffers new delights. For puzzle fans. <em>The 4 * Puzzler</em> is just\ntheir meat; for those who want to try their hand at a good\nvariety of quality puzzles, there is no better place for them\nto start.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
