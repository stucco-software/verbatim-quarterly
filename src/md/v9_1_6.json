For it turns out that many of\nthose word-laden galleons that visit American shores also return\nhome with their hulls stuffed with American exports: the traffic\nis two-way.  Through our contributions to other languages, we\nare beginning to repay many of our debts and establish a\nlinguistic balance of trade.</p>\n<p>Our word <em>automobile</em>, for example, has been exported\nwithout spelling change into French and Italian and with\nminor alterations into Spanish (<em>automovil</em>) and Swedish\n(<em>automobil</em>).  <em>Baseball</em> and <em>aspirin</em> turn up in French as <em>baseball</em>\nand <em>aspirine</em>, in Spanish as <em>beisbol</em> and <em>aspirina</em>, in\nGerman as <em>Baseball</em> and <em>Aspirin</em>, and in Swedish as <em>baseball</em>\nand <em>aspirin</em>.</p>\n<p>As <em>Time</em> magazine has pointed out, Germans have translated\nsome American expressions almost literally, such as <em>im\ngleichen Boot sitzen</em> 'to be in the same boat,' Germanized\nothers, like the verbs <em>parken, twisten</em>, and <em>hitchhiken</em>, and\nadopted others totally, like <em>scoop</em>, <em>paperback</em>, and <em>blue jeans</em>.\nFrench has imported such English terms as <em>baby, bridge club</em>,\nand <em>film</em>, while Spanish has embraced <em>romance</em>, <em>motor</em>, and <em>gas</em>.\nMany a Japanese businessman has a <em>kakuteiru</em> ('cocktail') with\nhis <em>fantazikku garu-furendo</em> ('fantastic girl friend').  And American\nwords have even infiltrated Russian stores, with products\nlike <em>miksers, tosters, komputers</em>, and <em>antifriz</em>.</p>\n<p>Doubtless, if our descendants make contact with thinking\nbeings on other planets and in other solar systems, we shall\nstart adding words from Martian, Saturnian, and Alpha\nCentaurian and exporting our vocabulary across outer space.\nThen English will become a truly universal language.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
