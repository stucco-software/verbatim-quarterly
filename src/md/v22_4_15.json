Of course, they should be shorter than what they stand for, or why use them? But they should also be quickly decodable for the original words, and that is not always the case. For example, does <em>ct.</em> mean 'count' or 'court'? It can mean either. Or take the state in which I live, Mississippi: should that be abbreviated <em>MS</em>, or is that for Missouri? Or if Missouri is MO, what is Montana, and if Montana is <em>MN</em> (try again), what is Minnesota? A few bouts of this will make your head spin.</p>\n<p>And then, some abbreviations have unsuspected depths, or at least possibilities I had never entertained. I have a friend named Mary who stands words on their heads. She is bright, articulate, and ten years old. “Why are some streets called <em>Beloved?”</em> She asked me the other day.</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?” I asked—my usual response to one of Mary's queries.</p>\n<p>“Right there,” she said, pointing to the lettering on a map that read <em>Grand Blvd</em>.</p>\n<p>“Mary, that's <em>Boulevard</em>, not <em>Beloved</em>,” I objected, but feebly. Mary's readings are often more interesting than the conventional interpretation.</p>\n<p>She turned her serious gray-eyed gaze full on me. “How can you tell?”</p>\n<p>“Context,” I replied with all the adult stiffness I could muster, and that seemed to convince her. But since then, she has me wondering. Why do so many roads end in <em>Saint</em>—Elm St., Main St.? What about the <em>Bulldog in the Manger</em> (“Bldg. Mgr. in rear”) I see listed in apartment blocks? How does a woman fit in an envelope (“Ms. enclosed”)?</p>\n<p>From there, it is a short route to <em>Phony Doctors</em> (Ph.D.s) and <em>municipal twerps</em> (“Now entering Monroe Twp.”). But maybe I had better stop here before I lose all central (<em>ctrl</em>.).</p>",
