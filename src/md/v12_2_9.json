For example, <em>Saturday-night\nspecial</em> is defined as a “cheap handgun of the type produced\nin large quantities by RG Industries of Miami, Fla.”\nGo to <em>RG</em> and find: <em>Rohm Gesellschaft</em> (German—Rohm\nCompany) initialized corporate name of the Rohm Tool subsidiary\nengaged in the assembly and manufacture of handguns\nat its Miami, Fla. plant on Northwest 20th Street,”\nwhich tells it all—including where to go to do your picketing\nand demonstrating or, if you're a crook, where to pick\nup your hardware.</p>\n<p>The <em>Crime Dictionary</em> is not a how-to book, and I'd\nrather not know how De Sola came by much of the information\nit contains.  On the one hand, it goes back to the period\nof the Wild West and, on the other, is so up-to-date that it\n(almost) gives addresses where drugs can be purchased\ntoday.  <em>Mata Hari</em> and <em>Judge Roy Bean</em> are in, but not Doc\nHolliday; a special foreign section has <em>lista negra</em> 'blacklist'\n(misspelt “negro” on the cover), but not <em>vache</em>, French for\n'cop.'  One can get a real education here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>lobato:</em> (Mexican Spanish—wolf cub) nickname given to\na Mexican child or juvenile who comes north across\nthe U.S. border to engage in automobile theft, mugging,\nrobbery, prostitution or shoplifting.</p>\n<p><em>Pubang buaya:</em> (Indonesian—crocodile hole) Djakarta\nwater hole infested with crocodiles and used as a\nplace to dispose of people at odds with the current\nadministration, as during the abortive communist\ncoup of 1965.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would be unfair to continue; besides, with the book\nin hand, the reader can find his own gems.  Many of the\nentries read like fiction or sound like TV crime drama,\nwhich is plentiful these days (and nights).  It is disturbing to\nthink of these entries as truly reflecting events continually\ntaking place in the real world, and I welcome the security of\nthe ivory tower from which I can experience such goings-on\nvicariously: I had, in my sheltered life, always thought of\nBig Boy as being a variety of tomato; according to De Sola,\na <em>big boy tomato</em> would be a woman who uses heroin.\nWhere have all the heroines gone?</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
