Take <em>jackeroo</em>, for instance, the name given to a young Englishman of independent means who came out to Australia to gain 'colonial experience' by working in a supernumerary capacity on a sheep or cattle station, who enrolled in the nineteenth-century equivalent of a senior management course, either genuinely to learn self-reliance or gracefully to take himself off his family's hands. In this sense it dates from the 1870s, and, of the several conjectural etymologies, those that link it with the Spanish <em>vaquero</em> or the English <em>Jacky Raw</em> seem at least possible. But then an earlier life was revealed: from the 1840s, and in Queensland especially, <em>jackeroo</em> had been used of a white man who lived beyond the bounds of close settlement and had taken on some of the not so savoury connotations of 'frontiersman.' The possible model of <em>kangaroo</em> suggested an Aboriginal origin, and, in the 1890s, one of the more indefatigable recorders of the Aboriginal languages, Charles Meston, came up with an etymology that fitted the chronology— and the geography—perfectly. He suggested that it was a transferred use of the Queensland Aboriginal word for a particularly noisy bird and that the connection was made by percipient Aborigines who applied it first to the German missionaries of 1838, having noted their garrulousness. From the specific to a general application was but a logical and consequent step. This rather pleasing etymology stood for a while but was discredited when R.M.W. Dixon failed to find an etymon in a Queensland language, despite a brave attempt to locate the origin in a putative Jagara word which was glossed as 'wandering white man.' And so we were back to square one and one of the more colorful words in Australian English had to suffer the indignity of having an uncertain origin.'</p>\n<p><em>Wowser</em> is another case in point. And again the history has thrown up more than the odd red herring. This time a prominent journalist claimed the word as his own invention, and the lack of any evidence to the contrary meant that the claim rested unchallenged. The editor of the Sydney <em>Truth</em> during the period 1895-1906, John Norton was one of those dynamic 'one man bands' who not infrequently seemed to have written whole issues on his own and who was certainly very influential in determining the style by which <em>Truth</em> came to be known. One of the features of this style was the alliterating, punning phrase, often used as a headline—'wasted wowsers' vied with 'watery wowsers' and indeed with 'weird and worried wowsers,' and the exercise was often carried to extremes—witness collocations like 'pious, Puritanical, pragmatical, pulpit-pounding self-pursuers whom we call wowsers,' or 'bald-headed, bad-breathed, bible-banging bummer, who ought to be banged with a bowser.' And certainly he overworked the word in the sense it has now of 'one who is publically censorious of the behavior of others.'</p>\n<p>But there was an earlier sense in that, for as little time as a decade, it has been shown to have been used in Australia, still as a pejorative term but with much less definition, more as a label for 'someone who is in some way disruptive of social mores, a public nuisance whose field of activity was left open.' The word was clearly felt to be a low word and there remains the possibility that Norton's role was more that of a promoter than of an inventor, that there was an existing word, probably a regional dialect word, that he brought to the surface and to which he gave a new currency. Rather like the more recent <em>scungy</em> which, after years of use in Scots and Irish for a 'sly or vicious person, a sponger,' suddenly found itself in vogue as a word connoting the general sordidness of modern youth. In the case of <em>wowser</em> there is the tantalizing possibility that a conjectural use of the word occurs in 1879 in just the sort of context that would fit this theory and make its subterranean existance a reality: but all we have to go on is <em>w—s</em>, and not many lexicographers would chance their arm on that! [For the quotation see the <em>Australian National Dictionary</em> [AND], whose editor had a bit both ways.]</p>\n<p>Like <em>scungy</em>, and possibly <em>wowser</em>, is <em>spoof</em>, a slang word for 'semen,' which turns up in a WWI context and then goes underground for the best part of 60 years. And perhaps this happened also to <em>molo</em>, meaning 'drink,' although the evidence is shaky to say the least [see <em>AND</em> again]. And <em>bottler</em> 'something or someone that excites admiration,' earliest recorded in 1855 in a quotation which carries the gloss 'as the saying is' and then not again for 20 years.</p>\n<p>This raises in my mind <em>bonzer</em> [<em>bonza, bonser</em>, or <em>bonsa</em>] which first makes its appearance with the gloss 'that bulwark of Austral Slanguage,' or its synonyms <em>boshter</em> and <em>bosker</em>, all three of which are first recorded in 1903 or 1904. Or <em>snodger</em>, another synonym, which had 60 years of vigorous life and then left as it had come, without a trace. Or <em>cobber</em>, a now obsolescent word for a 'friend,' or <em>digger</em>, which began as a term for a 'goldminer,' then inexplicably became a term for an 'Australian or New Zealand soldier' in WWI and is now similarly obsolescent, even in the abbreviated term of address <em>dig</em>.</p>\n<p>Who was <em>Larry</em> in 'happy as Larry' or <em>Hughie</em> in 'send her down, Hughie' [an invocation to the rain god]? Why is a 'brothel' called <em>Timothy</em>? Why is a 'tropical storm' in the north and west called a <em>cock-eyed bob</em>? How does the game of <em>two-up</em> come to be referred to in its earliest citation as the “national game”? Will we ever be able to say with confidence “probably,” or even “possibly,” or “perhaps”?</p>\n<h2></h2>",
