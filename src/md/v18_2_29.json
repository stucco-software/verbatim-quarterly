Now I feel compelled to respond\nto Jack Orbaum's interesting letter [EPISTOLAE, XVII,\n4] about the “mistranslation” of the Hebrew word\n'<em>almah</em> in Isaiah 7:14, which Mr. Orbaum says ought\nnot be translated 'virgin' but 'young woman.'</p>\n<p>As readers of VERBATIM well know, it is simplistic\nto assume that there is but one correct translation\nof any given word.  <em>'Almah</em> is no exception.  It almost\nsurely does mean 'young woman,' but it can also\nmean a 'girl,' 'maiden,' 'bride,' 'youthful spouse,' a\n'woman of marriageable age' or 'the age of puberty'\n(according to Gesenius-Robinson, my trusty 1888\n<em>Hebrew and English Lexicon).</em>  It is not difficult to\ninfer virginity from some of these usages (at least in\nBiblical times when virginity prior to marriage was\nexpected of a woman).  My old lexicon also points\nout, as does Jack Orbaum, that the customary word\nfor 'virgin' is <em>bethulah,</em> not <em>'almah</em>.</p>\n<p>That brings us to the Septuagint, the Greek\ntranslation of the Hebrew Old Testament “said to\nhave been made by 72 Palestinian Jews during the\nthird century B.C. at the command of Ptolemy Philadelphus...\nthis version of the Bible was used in\nMediterranean lands during the time of Christ and\nthe early Church.”  (William Rose Benét, <em>The\nReader's Encyclopedia,</em> 2nd ed., 1968) The Septuagint\ntranslates <em>'almah</em> in Isaiah 7:14 as <em>parthenos.</em>\nThayer's <em>Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament</em>\nsays of <em>parthenos:</em> “a virgin... (fr. Hom. down;\nSept. chiefly for <em>bethulah,</em> several times for <em>na'arah;</em>\ntwice for <em>'almah</em> ...).”  So we see that the Greek\nword “chiefly” chosen by the Septuagint scholars to\nmean <em>parthenos</em> is the word <em>bethulah</em>, which Mr.\nOrbaum stresses is “the Hebrew word for <em>virgin</em>.”\nBut the Jewish scholars of the Septuagint also chose\nthe word <em>parthenos</em> to translate <em>'almah</em> in Isaiah\n7:14, where one might have expected a less specific\nword.  It becomes very muddy.  Gesenius-Robinson,\nby the way, translates <em>bethulah</em> as “a virgin pure and\nunspotted,” “a virgin just married,” and “a young\nspouse” (see Joel 1:8, where <em>bethulah</em> is translated\nby the Septuagint as <em>nymphe,</em> “a betrothed woman, a\nbride,” “a recently married woman, young wife”—\nThayer).  The Jerusalem Bible, in a footnote to the\nword “maiden” (as <em>'almah</em> is translated by them in\nIsaiah 7:14) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Greek version reads “the virgin,” being\nmore explicit than the Hebr. which uses <em>almah,</em>\nmeaning either a young girl or a young, recently\nmarried woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A more recent commentary on Isaiah 7:14 may\nbe helpful here, or may simply muddy the waters\nfurther.  Carl Stuhlmueller, C.P., in “Psalm 46 and\nthe Prophecy of Isaiah Evolving into a Prophetic,\nMessianic Role” in <em>The Psalms and Other Studies on\nthe Old Testament,</em> 1990, writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... we return to Isa 7:14 and especially the Septuagint\nrendition of 'alma.  As is well known, this\nGreek text renders the word with the technical\nword for virgin, <em>parthenos,</em> not with what one\nwould expect, <em>neanis</em>—young maid, the Greek\nword which is deliberately put in place here in\nthe ancient Greek versions of Aquila, Symmachus\nand Theodotion.  We suggest that the Septuagint\nsees the maid as Jerusalem, the virgin spouse of\nthe Lord.  The text of Isaiah, therefore, resounds\nwith extraordinary richness: the mysterious, marvelous,\nfertile ways of new life, accomplished\nsolely by the Lord through Israel's faith.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Innumerable chapters and verses might be cited\nwithout a definitive answer and without convincing\nany one side of the debate that <em>'almah</em> unquestionably\nmeans, or does not mean, 'virgin' in Isaiah 7:14.\nIt may be worth noting here that Martin Luther used\nthe word <em>Jungfrau</em> to translate <em>'almah</em>, <em>bethulah</em>, and\n<em>parthenos</em>.  <em>Jungfrau</em>, although referring almost exclusively\nto 'virgin' in present-day German, has the\nliteral root sense of 'young woman,' or 'young wife.'\nThe English word <em>virgin</em> itself comes from the Latin\n<em>virgo</em>, which can mean 'virgin,' 'maiden,' or 'young\nwoman' and which reflects the same ambiguity as\nthe other languages.</p>\n<p>Translation cannot be an exact science, and so\nwe may never know precisely what the author of\nIsaiah 7:14, or the author of Matthew 1:23f, meant.\nIsaiah's authors (and there were most likely more\nthan one) were poets.  Matthew's author(s) had an ax\nto grind and sought to prove a point by using a\nrabbinical-style proof-text argument.  In either case,\nwe must not expect these writers to use words as we\nshould like them to have done.  Some translators are\npoets or teachers, too, and we must not expect them\nnecessarily to respond to words in our fashion, either.\nI would make a plea that we all be a bit more\ncareful in our use of the term “mistranslation.”</p>\n<p>It remains unclear to me on whom Mr. Orbaum\nwould pin the blame for what he calls “the original\nmistranslation.”  He seems to suggest that somehow\nwe should fault the group of translators who produced\nthe King James Version of the Bible, but, as\nwe have seen, the confusion lies not so much with a\ngroup of sixteenth century English scholars as with\nthe very nature of the art of translation.  The Christian\nChurch, nevertheless, chose to latch on to the\nconcept of the Virgin Birth long before the sixteenth\ncentury (<em>cf</em>. Tertullian, who lived c. 160-240 A.D.) in\nany case, and we do not know whether the use of\nIsaiah 7:14 was to justify an already extant belief\nwith a text, or whether it was to take an already\naccepted text and graft its meaning, as was then understood,\nupon the events of the Annunciation to\nMary.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it seems, one's reading here comes\nmost likely from religious orientation rather than\nfrom “correctness” of translation.  We agree to disagree\nand, meanwhile, enjoy the richness of languages\nand the art of playing among them.</p>\n<p><em>[Roy B. Flinchbaugh, Jr., York, Pennsylvania]</em></p>",
