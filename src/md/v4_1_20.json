Linguistic philosophers, who are\nthe kind of people who like to separate their words into distinct\nand clearly-defined operable units (as, for example, in\nthe assertion that there are two apples in this cart, and three\noranges in that cart) simply balk at the 2 + 2 = 5 mentality of\nmost compounds.  (Take, for example, the notorious query:\n“What is the meaning of <em>applecart</em> in the statement: 'Don't\nupset the applecart'?”)  According to Mütter, it (the noncompoundite\nintellect) “is unable to split in one lightning-stroke\n(<em>blitzkrieg</em>) the complex welter (<em>plexwelt</em>) of ideas, associations,\nand images which compounds, denoting permanent\nor transient actions, qualities, or states, represent.”  The\nmind is thus hurled, willy-nilly, into the very jaws of duality,\nand forced to entertain simultaneously two dissimilarlycompatible\nconcepts, which, however, still fall far short of the\nintended meaning.

Dr. Algol Blauhaus, a student of\nmagnitudes, has claimed to discern infinite digression in the\nseries of conceptions, and deals only with magistian infinity-factors,\na branch of the science which is still, so to speak, in\nits infancy.  In any case, despite the constant unearthing of\nnew data, the basic compost made by Mütter has sprouted\nwhat in this century has come to be known as the Society\nfor the Preservation of Ancient Compounds.  The name can\nbe somewhat misleading, as Society members seek not only\nto preserve ancient compounds, but also avidly promote the\nscience of magistics.  They also openly encourage the assimilation\nof infinite digressions.</p>\n<p>This avowed and open activity on the part of SPAC members\nis watched with panic on both sides of the Atlantic by\nlanguage technicians and computer specialists, people who\nare somewhat derisively referred to by Society members as\n<em>compeeps</em>.  (Panic: <em>ealu-scerwen</em>, 'terror as at the loss of ale.')\nIt has been pointed out by members of the pro-compound\nparty that a person who panics at the proliferation of compounds\nis probably a <em>nincompoop</em> 'non compos mentis' if\nnot <em>niçakeçaçmaçrunakhas</em>, 'he who has short hair, nails,\nand beard.'  The compeeps, in turn, call the compounders\n<em>kunophron</em>, 'having the soul of a dog,' and <em>boukephalos</em>,\n'with the forehead of an ox' (<em>Front-de-Boeuf</em>).</p>\n<p>Debates on both sides of the compound fence are aired\nover most stations, and compound-slung epithets frequently\njam the ears of the listening public.  From Hoboken ('smoke\npipe') to Derby ('village of wild beasts'), from Punjab ('five\nrivers') to Algonquin ('those on the other side of the river'),\ncompound-keepers have been spotted, trapping and talontagging\npossible topics before mating them.  Often\ndemonstrations on behalf of compounds are held, as the one\nwhich we recently attended in Massachusetts, 'blue hills.'\n(Incidentally, the five brothers Padavas were there, 'having\ntheir mother for sixth (companion)'—<em>matri-śaśtha</em>.)  Professor\nLeichen-Bleich ('pale as a corpse') spoke for the computer\npeople, calling the compounders <em>chairekakoi</em>, 'those who rejoice\nin evil,' and <em>ethelorhetoroi</em>, 'pretending to be orators.'\nHe also denounced the whole compounded controversy as\nbeing nothing more than an insipid quibble over <em>piqsirpoq</em>\nand <em>qininqsug</em>, 'drifting snow' and 'snowdrift.'  The noted\nBoston Brahmaness <em>Nihçvasa-parama</em>, 'sighing a great deal,'\nor 'regarding sighs as the supreme thing,' countered appropriately\nfor the Archaic Society by discoursing upon the\ndekeeping-childlightsomeness which certain compounds\nhave, the <em>ambologera</em>, 'who puts off old age.'  She also spoke\nfeelingly for the kind of compound which has the <em>dakethumos</em>,\n'that bites into the heart.'  Professor Leichen-Bleich,\nattempting to pun upon Ms. Nihçvasa-parama's multisibilance,\nreminded her of the Spartan woman 'who shows\nher thighs' (<em>phainomeris</em>); and, as for biting into the heart,\nhe'd just as soon be 'wounded by a thorn' (<em>akanthoplex</em>).  But\nHerman Stockfest ('firm as a stump'), snorting visibly,\ncalled the spokesman for the compeeps an old fly-flapper\n(<em>proboscis</em>) and a shuffle-foot who spoke nothing but\nfatback, a composite which seems to have carried the day as\nno one could come up with an immediate Greek, Latin, or\nSanskrit equivalent.</p>\n<p>Compounders and polysemiasts are urged to send samples\nof their work to the Archaic Society, which is always\nglad to supply interested members of the public with\ncompounds for new or old diseases, states, conditions, or\nhabits of mind.  Cremnophobics, for example, afraid of falling\nfrom cliffs, should be happy to know they no longer\nneed to be classed with ordinary acrophobics.  Those with\nan excessive fear of holy places should jot down <em>hagiophobia</em>,\nand at long last 'fear of Friday the 13th' can take its place in\nour growing family of componderables as the insidious triskaidekaphobia.\nAnd finally, those of you who, like the compeeps,\ncringe at compounds, can always take comfort that\n<em>floccinaucinihilipilification</em> is just the word you've been\nwaiting for.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
