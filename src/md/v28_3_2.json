The Work of Ramón Gómez de la Serna</h1>\n<p><em><span data-rel=\"author\">Walter Redfern</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Reading</span></em></p>\n<p>Born in Madrid in 1891, and later living in\nBuenos Aires, Ramón Gómez de la Serna (he telescoped himself to just 'Ramón') first published his\n<em>greguerías</em> in 1910. This cornucopious author was\nalso a globettroting lecturer, orating on occasion in\ncircuses while swinging from a trapeze or perched\non an elephant's back.\nThough he no more came out of nowhere than\nany of us, he was a true original. What he called his\n“danceable philosophy” harks back to medieval\nSpanish Arabic poetry, which is based on acute\nobservation (essential in the desert, but still serviceable in cities and gardens) of human, animal, and\nbotanical phenomena. Or climatic: here is Ramón\non various weathers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rain is melancholy because it takes us back to\nthe time when we were fishes.</p>\n<p>A thunderstorm is the first day at school all\nover again.</p>\n<p>Electricity is God's nervous system.</p>\n<p>The rainbow is a dry-cleaner's neon advert.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ramón offered umpteen explanations for his\nchoice of the term <em>greguería,</em> which means 'hubbub, outcry,' and, by extension, 'the squeals of\npiglets around the sow.' In general, what things,\nlife, the universe, and everything murmur to us. He\nmakes the tacit talkative, the dumb world an open\nbook, chattering to readers. Although he makes a\nsong-and-dance about the need not to confuse\n<em>greguerías</em> with maxims or other congealed asseverations, he cannot resist teaching us, in effect, to\nopen our ears and eyes. Like Nicholson Baker, he is\nthe poet of littleness.\nMany greguerías are blatantly precious, conceits, but no less serious for all that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some men with wooden legs turn green in<br>\nSpring and rebecome satyrs.</p>\n<p>The human ear is forever asking questions.</p>\n<p>Our head is a fish-tank for ideas.</p>\n<p>Dust is full of old and forgotten sneezes.</p>\n<p>In the phone-book we are all Lilliputians.</p>\n<p>An embrace is a necklace without a fastener.</p>\n<p>After using toothpaste we bare our teeth like wild animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The majority are fleeting impressions (are there\nany other sorts?), but the apparently related haiku,\nin his eyes, is inferior, because too fragile and\nevanescent:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some dirty skies look as if water-colourists had\ncleaned their brushes on them.</p>\n<p>Seagulls are born from handkerchiefs waving\ngoodbye on jetties.</p>\n<p>The feline gaze of screws.</p>\n<p>The hardest fish to land is a bar of soap in the\nbath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As befits a Modernist, many, while natural in\ntheir gracefulness, are autoreferential:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Giblets are a chicken's greguerías.\nThe typing keyboard is the alphabet's false\nteeth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All are resolutely anthropomorphic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes flies look as if they're trying to rip\ntheir heads off, sick to death of being flies.</p>\n<p>The peach is a blonde with her hair parted in\nthe middle.</p>\n<p>Nature is sad. Have you ever seen a tree smile?</p>\n<p>We thought of turtle soup when we saw the\ntureen on the creature's back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Greguerías are quintessentially metaphors.\nThey twin two objects or two ideas that up to then\nhad each been an only child.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking upwards in a narrow street you see the\nsky's cleavage.</p>\n<p>Sleep is a lost-property office.</p>\n<p>Mussels are the sea's castanets.</p>\n<p>Every statue is like a blind beggar holding out\nhis hand for alms.</p>\n<p>Nostalgia is the neuralgia of memory.</p>\n<p>Many make you think twice, or for the first\ntime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Greguerías, it has been said, are the pencil-\nsharpeners of ideas.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The moon is the wrong way round.</p>\n<p>The sea spends its time throwing buckets of\ncold water on the land to bring it to its senses.</p>\n<p>Every grave contains an alarm-clock set for the\nLast Judgement.</p>\n<p>Consoling thought: worms die too.</p>\n<p>The bagpiper wears his lungs and larynx outside his body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ramón is the poet of the trivial, who glories in\nit. He agrees with Chesterton that the telescope\ndiminishes the universe, whereas the microscope\nenlarges it. He could have called his 'micro-ideas,'\nto use Chesterton's oxymoron, <em>Tremendous Trifles.</em>\nBoth escalate the minuscule.</p>\n<p>Why did Ramón reject “Alphabet soup is good\nfor dyslexics”? Like any humourist, indeed any\nhuman being, he reserved the right to contradict\nhimself, to practise what he preached against. Hence\nthe numerous axioms, saved by humour from being\npedantic. But only metaphorically do his metaphors\nhave anything to do with piglets squealing.\nThis forerunner of Surrealism is a releasing\nagent, a dowser. Whether his <em>greguerías</em> offer\ngenuine insight into the inscape of reality is up to\neach reader of VERBATIM, each verbatimocrat,\nto judge. She or he might well wonder what this\nhoo-ha about <em>greguerías</em> has to do with language.\nAn even better question is: what isn't to do with\nlanguage?</p>\n<p><em>Qasidas,</em> medieval Arabic poems, ended traditionally with a panegyric of some notable.\nRamón's prose-poems celebrate the mini-wonders of the world and, of course, himself. As Beau\nBrummell said of a dandaical coat: “I wear it to\nadvertise myself.”</p>\n<p><em>[Walter Redfern is an Emeritus Professor at\nReading University.
