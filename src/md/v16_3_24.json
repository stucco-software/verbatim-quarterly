But zawn isn't in my household\ndictionary <em>(Webster's Ninth New Collegiate)</em>, or <em>Webster's\nThird New International Unabridged</em>, or several\nquite specialized ones in the public library.</p>\n<p>The same book repeats <em>voe</em> another unusual\nword not in my dictionary, defined by the <em>Unabridged</em>\nas “an inlet or narrow bay of the...Shetland\nIslands.”  The entire book is about the\nShetlands, and I accept the need for some ethnicisms,\ntechnicisms, and colloquialisms to establish\ncredibility of persons, subject, or place.  Nor was its\nuse so overwhelming or constant, “inlet” or “bay”\nsometimes being substituted.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c1\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sometimes when a word is used frequently\nsomething else happens too, and a real mess results\nwith a wrong word overused.  Just such an incident a\nfew years ago started me collecting these verbal\noddities instead of stamps or seashells.  A wrong\nthough somehow plausible noun, consistently and\nrepeatedly used throughout, distracted me from a\nquite good novel.  <em>Refectory</em> 'a monastery or college\ndining hall' was used for rectory 'the residence of a\nparish priest,' first on page 148, twice on 151, once\neach on 152 and 153, thrice on 154, and so on, last\nnear the book's end on page 257.  Eventually I concluded\neven the correct word would have become\nmaddening from repetition, unrelieved by a synonym\nor circumlocution.  The poor overworked noun\nwas even used where neither it nor any alternate\nwas needed.  “I'll be staying at the refectory [rectory]\nat” could surely be “at the church in” since\nonly church mice and Quasimodo stay in the edifice\nitself, or “in St. Botolph's parish,” as no one literally\nstays overnight in either a mere geographical area or\na spiritual community.  “The rectory gate was the\nsecond on the left...;.  But, as she hesitated, the\nrectory door opened....  He led her into the rectory\nparlor.”  All on page 154.  Why not just gate,\ndoor, and parlor?  Is a rectory so different from any\nother house—one or more priests and perhaps a\nhousekeeper do <em>live</em> there!<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>I have no real doubt that <em>zawn</em> is a legitimate\nand <em>the</em> correct word, but I question why such an\napparently obscure one is used.  Not that the practice\nis uncommon.</p>\n<p>“The doctor stood back and appraised her with\na comforting smile—.  'Did you sense any warning\njust before the seizure—?'</p>\n<p>'Yes...a very odd smell...I noticed it once\nbefore.  At a party the other night.  No one else\nsmelled it.'</p>\n<p>'An uncinate fit,' the doctor said almost under\nher breath.</p>\n<p>'There's a technical term for that too?' ”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Indeed there is, but it's again obscure, and perhaps\nin a worse way.  My household dictionary and\nthe library's <em>Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage, 2nd Ed.  Unabridged</em> both define <em>uncinate</em>\nonly as “hooked, bent at the end.”  <em>Webster's New\nInt'l 2nd Ed.  Unabridged</em> finally yielded; “uncinate\ngyrus...<em>anat</em>.; a subdivision of the hippocampal\nconvolution containing olfactory association centers.”\nSo the use was correct, but to what end?</p>\n<p>Sometimes a word is not so obscure.  “Grinning\nfiercely, Jo kept his listeners...ensorceled for as\nlong as an hour.”  My house dictionary defines <em>ensorcel</em>,\nmatter-of-factly, “bewitch, enchant,” dates the\nword from the 16th century, spells it with one “1” or\ntwo, but doesn't say why anyone would disinter it.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c4\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">4</a></sup>\nOne book had “a caliginous haze,” “eyot of firm\nland,” and “cetaceous eye.”  I had to look up two,\nand checked the last.  Two of three were in the house\ndictionary.  But why are they used in a mystery\nnovel?!<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c5\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Occasionally an author gracefully defines a\nword: “bettas—you know, Siamese fighting fish.”\nBut a few lines before: “syngoniums and pothos.” It\ncould be accounted fortuitous that I knew what bettas\nwere, but why choose to define that word in my\nhousehold dictionary and not the first two?  Both are\nin <em>Webster's Unabridged:</em> evidently not uncommon\nplants.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c6\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c6\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Authors put in text definitions easily forgo-able\nby readers.  A policeman suffers tension-caused muscle\nspasms his wife relieves by massage.  “Nowadays\nit's—his bad arm—.  But formerly—it was\nfrequent enough for him—to feel his back had\nbeen flogged, and she would tell him to—stretch\nout flat.  That's prone: supine is the other way\nround.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c7\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c7\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>Which leads me to: a prig “irritates by observance\nof proprieties (as of speech) in a pointed manner\nor to an obnoxious degree,” while a pedant “unduly\nemphasizes minutiae in the presentation of\nknowledge.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c8\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c8\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">8</a></sup>  What\nhe tells us is true, but does it\nmatter to his book?</p>\n<p>Sometimes authors create words, maybe accidentally;\ntwice in one book seems deliberate:\n“searched—across the rooves of New York” and\n“red tilted rooves of a town.”  The same book has “I\ndreampt and I was the dream which dreampt itself.”\nUnless I'm missing a classical allusion, why is it not\njust <em>dreamt</em>?  The dictionary says “hoofs, rarely\nhooves” but only “roofs”; perhaps we tend to pronounce\nit as “rooves.”  As indeed I can, if I choose\nto, hear the “p” in “dreamt,” as in unkempt and\ntempt.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c9\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c9\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>Then we have “every sort of forcep.”  The singular\nis <em>forceps</em>; the plural <em>forceps</em>, or rarely\n<em>forcepses</em>.  Not like some other usually plural nouns,\n<em>scissor hold or cut</em>, a wollen <em>trouser</em>, maybe even a\nlace-trimmed <em>panty</em>, but no sort of “forcep”!<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c10\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c10\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>Another offense is using verbs as nouns.  “It's\nonly temporary disableds need assistance.”  Scot's\nspeech explains the elliptical style, and the best fix\nmight be, “Temporary cripples.” If one can't abide\n“cripples,” perhaps “the temporarily disabled”\nmight be both grammatical and still “in voice.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c11\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c11\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sometimes a writer simply uses the <em>wrong</em> word:\n“But it's part of the character of an infinite recession\nthat the final box is much too small to open or even\nsee.  And anyway, there isn't one.”  Indeed not in a\n<em>recession</em>; try an <em>infinite regression</em>!  I am also dubious\nof “There is a lesion between hope and recollection,\ninto which my spirit had slipped—.”  Are lesions\nbetween things?  Can you really slip into one?<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c12\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c12\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>Or consider: “Kate—explained—the scars\n—were the result of a car accident in which her\nhands had been pinched.  This she did unblushingly,\nthough both 'accident' and 'pinch' were retrospective\naggrandizements, her hands having been quite\ndeliberately slammed in a car door, twice each.”\nSomeone ought to blush, because whatever they are,\nthey are not aggrandizements, “things made to appear\ngreater.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c13\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c13\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">13</a></sup>  “<em>Retrogressive</em> aggrandizements,”\nmaybe, but that's an oxymoron of another colour entirely.</p>\n<p>Some errors are harder to see but just as surely\nmistaken: “I frowned at the coffee percolator, which\n—finally began to perk.  I cradled the telephone between\nshoulder and ear, poured, and—took a sip of\ncoffee.”  What should but doesn't follow is, “And then\nquickly spit out the colorless, tasteless gulp of hot\nwater.”  Coffee isn't ready to drink when it begins but\nwhen it finishes perking.  Our author evidently\ndoesn't make his own, or at least not using a percolator.\nIt is a paranoid writer who even keeps secret how\nhe makes coffee—shades of J.D. Salinger!<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c14\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c14\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>Complex situations create subtle errors.  “Phyllis\nstood at the far end....  When Joanna spoke her\nname, she turned, reaching for a pair of hornrimmed\nglasses—setting them on the bridge of\nher nose—.  She hurried over—then removed\nthe glasses—which were for farsightedness—and\nplunked them back on top of her head.”  And later:\n“When Joanna glanced back at her friend from the\ndoor, she saw that she had her glasses perched on\nher nose and was staring after her with worried\neyes.”  <em>For</em> implies purpose or explanation: glasses\n<em>for</em> 'to achieve' or <em>for</em> 'because of' [farsightedness].\nUsed about physical vision, farsighted and nearsighted\nare not gifts like quick-footedness or nightvision,\nor neutral like lefthandedness, but defects,\neach defined comparatively.  Nearsightedness, the\nability to see near things more clearly than distant\nones, is basically defective vision of distant objects.\nFarsightedness is the ability to see distant things\nquite normally, but <em>ipso facto</em>, the inability to see\nnear ones well.  Why then does Phyllis put her\nglasses on to see things across the room and remove\nthem when near the objects of her scrutiny?  Because\nshe is nearsighted, and her glasses ought to be\nfor nearsightedness.  Her eyes looked worried because\nshe was wearing the wrong glasses!  They were\nindeed for “seeing at a distance,” but that's not what\n<em>farsightedness</em> means.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c15\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c15\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">15</a></sup></p>\n<p>Writers sometimes leave themselves open to inadvertent\ndouble meaning.  In a detective novel: “I\nbought a Bud light to go with my sandwich and—\ndid some ruminating while I ate.”  Since cows also\nruminate while eating, the issue is whether it is over\nthe toughness of the case or of the roast beef, ham\nand Swiss, or pastrami sandwich.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c16\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c16\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">16</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is even possible that sometimes the one right\nword may be two or more!  “Tyranny is funny; not\nactual tyranny but the attempts of tyrants to cover\nup their tyrannousness.”  My dictionary approves <em>tyrannicalness</em>,\nthough I wouldn't really use that word\neither.  How about “oppressive tendency” or even\n<em>tyranny</em> once again?<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c17\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c17\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>An author may miss the mark with an expression.\n“Lorimer wondered whether the Chairman\n— had sent him out as a sort of stalking lamb, to see\nwhat reaction he would stir up.” Or perhaps a tethered\nparakeet, sacrificial tortoise, or Judas rabbit?  It\nshould be “stalking <em>horse</em>,” of course, of course!<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c18\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c18\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>“I shall simply talk quietly to old Harwell like a\nDutch nephew....”  Even if youngish Tim Simpson,\nthe hero and speaker, could not readily speak to\nold Harwell like a <em>Dutch uncle</em>, the usual expression,\nwhy not just resist the temptation to make an (at\nbest) bad pun?<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c19\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c19\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>Even in word-portraits of people, authors turn\nunhappy phrases: “His eyes seemed filled with spit\nand vinegar.”  Hard to say what that means, except\nstinging eyes, and besides, using half of each of two\nclichés is simply spilt milk off a duck's back on troubled\nwaters: isn't it “spit and polish” and “piss and\nvinegar?”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c20\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c20\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">20</a></sup></p>\n<p>To end on an uplifting note: “For an hour the\nlecture was heavy with the importance of dream\nstate, pulse and heart rate, vaginal tumescence and\ntemperature change, rapid eye movement and the\nsize and frequency of penal erection.”  The word,\nclearly, is <em>penile</em>, from <em>penis; penal</em> comes from the\nlantin <em>poena</em> 'pain or punishment.'  A prison riot is\nnot a penile, but a penal uprising; and erections, unless\nsome subtle word play about painfulness or punishment\nis intended, are not penal but penile.[^c21]</p>\n<hr>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-c1\">\n<p><em>Offshore: A North Sea Journey</em>, A.
