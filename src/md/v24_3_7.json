When he returned</p>\n<p>To Court, he doubtless thought he'd earned</p>\n<p>The right to find his fault forgot,</p>\n<p>But no, the witty queen had not:</p>\n<p>She made the other courtiers laugh</p>\n<p>With what's shown in my epigraph.</p>\n<p>Though time had worn her teeth, her tongue</p>\n<p>Grew sharper than when she was young,</p>\n<p>And it was, even in her youth,</p>\n<p>As sharp as any serpent's tooth!</p>\n<p>Whetted by seven years, it bit</p>\n<p>At anything that stirred her wit;</p>\n<p>And seven years had made that jest</p>\n<p>Too pestilent to be repressed.</p>\n<p>If it seems strange so great a queen</p>\n<p>Could be so small as to demean</p>\n<p>Herself by mouthing such a word</p>\n<p>As even then was seldom heard,</p>\n<p>She doubtless felt she was above</p>\n<p>What others might be chary of:</p>\n<p>So low a thing was quite all right</p>\n<p>When uttered from so high a height!</p>\n<p>—<em>Henry George Fischer</em></p>",
