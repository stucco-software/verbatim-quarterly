All these elements are linked by a use of language which reflects a character that is straight-talking, plain-speaking, and prefers to call a spade a spade rather than an agricultural digging implement. Never mind that a miner from South Yorkshire might not fully understand either the accent or the vernacular of a native of Hull (East Yorkshire), or vice versa, the intention to “say it like it is” will always be present.</p>\n<p>Here follow some examples of such “plain speaking” to illustrate:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Putt t'wood in</em>'<em>t oil!</em></p>\n<p>'Could you please close the door?'</p>\n<p><em>Poor lass, 'er bairn's reet mawngey.</em></p>\n<p>'That poor girl has a very fretful baby.'</p>\n<p><em>She</em>'<em>s a reet midden.</em></p>\n<p>'That woman is of easy virtue.'</p>\n<p><em>A</em>'<em>m brassed off!</em></p>\n<p>'I am not very happy today.'</p>\n<p><em>'Ees thick as two short planks.</em></p>\n<p>'He is totally lacking in intelligence.'</p>\n<p>'<em>Ees daft as a brush!</em></p>\n<p>'What an extremely silly person!'</p>\n<p><em>A</em>'<em>m fair mafted.</em></p>\n<p>'I am feeling the heat somewhat.'</p>\n<p><em>Eeh, A were gobsmacked!</em> or <em>A'll go to ower 'ouse!</em> or <em>A'll go tut fut o' ower stairs!</em></p>\n<p>'I was so surprised, it rendered me speechless!'</p>\n<p><em>Bluddy 'ell fire!</em></p>\n<p>'I am [any of these:] shocked/surprised/dismayed/furious.'</p>\n<p><em>Tha</em>'<em>s as much use as a chocolate teapot (or fireguard).</em></p>\n<p>'You are totally ineffectual.'</p>\n<p><em>It's like plaitin' fog (or jugglin' soot).</em></p>\n<p>'This is an extremely difficult task to complete.'</p>\n<p><em>It's a tuppny 'op on t'trackless.</em></p>\n<p>'The journey is a short distance by tram.'</p>\n<p><em>'Ark at pot callin' kettle grimey-arse!</em></p>\n<p>'Did you hear that?

Oh, and a <em>rum bugger</em> is 'someone with a murky past.'</p>\n<p>In conclusion, here is a song used many years ago as the opener in a folk club in the Bronte village of Haworth. The first verse is sung loudly, with much winking and nudging, while the second, translation verse is sung in close harmony.  The tourists present always applauded with great relief, having been reassured that English was the language in use here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We're reet daawn in t'coil oil</em></p>\n<p><em>Where t'mud slatts ta t'windas</em></p>\n<p><em>We've used all us coil up</em></p>\n<p><em>An' we're reet daawn t t'cinders.</em></p>\n<p><em>If bumbugger comes, 'e waint know where ta find us,</em></p>\n<p><em>Cos we're reet daawn in t'coil oil</em></p>\n<p><em>Where t'mud slatts ta t'windas!</em></p>\n<p>'We are way down in the basement,</p>\n<p>Where the dust accumulates on the casement.</p>\n<p>We have used all the coal up and are left with the residue.</p>\n<p>If the rent-collector's representative calls, he will be unable to discover our hiding place.</p>\n<p>Because we are way down in the basement,</p>\n<p>Where the dust accumulates on the casement!'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Remember, when visiting Yorkshire, the maxim that <em>There's nowt so queer as folk—</em>'Everyone has their little idiosyncracies'—holds good and <em>Ye'll be reet!</em></p>\n<p><em>[Anne Moore was born in Belfast.
