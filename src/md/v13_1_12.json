While it is true that scores of words admitted\ninto Anglo-Indian were imported into England by\ncolonials and thence into the English language, many\nof those catalogued in <em>Hobson-Jobson</em> either never\nearned their passage or, perhaps because they referred\nto cultural matters and objects that had no counterparts\nin western life, lost whatever currency they\nmight once have had.  The authors collected, also,\nimported words that occurred in Anglo-Indian; <em>banjo</em>\nis included, for example, with these words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... Though this is a West- and not East-Indian\nterm, it may be worth while to introduce the\nfollowing older form of the word:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. “Permit thy slaves to lead the choral\ndance To the wild <em>banshaw's</em>\nmelancholy sound.”—Grainger, iv.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many of the words described are not Indian in\norigin but derive from Arabic, Persian, Portuguese,\nand other tongues spoken by traders whose settlements\nantedated those of the British.  Thus, <em>betel</em> is traced to\nMalayalam, <em>beri-beri</em> to Singhalese, <em>bulbul</em> ('nightingale')\nto Persian, <em>calash</em> to French (from Slavic?), <em>cassowary</em>\nto Malay, <em>catamaran</em> to Tamil, <em>hooka</em> to Hindi\n(from Arabic), <em>Mandarin</em> to Portuguese; but, as is to\nbe expected, the great majority are derived from one\nor another of the dialects of the subcontinent.  It\nshould be mentioned, too, that some attempt is made\nto provide etymologies for placenames, but these tend\nto be speculative.</p>\n<p>This review cannot give the flavor of the work\nwithout an example or two.  In the etymological note\nfor CANDY (SUGAR-) appears the following intelligence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A German writer, long within last century,...\nappears to derive <em>candy</em> from Candia, “because\nmost of the sugar which the Venetians imported\nwas brought from that island”—a fact probably\ninvented for the nonce.  But the writer was the\nsame wiseacre who (in the year 1829) characterised\nthe book of Marco Polo as a “clumsily\ncompiled ecclesiastical fiction disguised as a Book\nof Travels.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, in the matter of the use of <em>boy</em> for 'servant,'\n<em>Hobson-Jobson</em> suggests that it probably does not come\nfrom English at all, for there are several cognate\nforms, <em>bōyí, bōvi, bhoi, bhūī</em>, derived from Malayalam,\nTamil, Hindi, and Mahrathi, which mean\n'palankin-bearer'; moreover, the citations antedate\nany possible involvement with speakers of English.</p>\n<p>Yule's Introductory Remarks make an excellent\nessay, in which a number of words from diverse\nsources are conveniently listed together.  There is also\nan Index that lists headwords as well as all of the variant\nforms for which citations are given.  This is truly a\nwelcome reprint of a book that has become increasingly\nhard to find in the antiquarians' shelves and\ncatalogues.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<p>[Editor's Note: A review of this book appeared in\na recent [XII,2] issue of VERBATIM; the reviewer\nregarded it less than favorably.  Henri du Chazaud has\nsent us the following review to even the score, and we\nthought it useful and interesting to publish it as well.\nOne might say that the book will thus have received\n“mixed reviews” within the same periodical.]</p>\n<h1></h1>",
