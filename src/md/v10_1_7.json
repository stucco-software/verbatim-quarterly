Dent, 1982), xiii + 270 pp.</p>\n<p>The first item served up for criticism in this book is the\npronunciation system: without wasting much time on it, I\nshould point out that it is awful, though undoubtedly it would\nhave not been quite so bad had the book designer kept his\nitchy fingers off it and set it in a serif face, not sansserif, as it\nappears in the book.  If the reader does not know how a word is\npronounced before checking it in the Guide, he is likely to\nlearn little from the information provided.</p>\n<p>I am confused, too, as to why Dent thought that this book\nwould (or could) do well in America.  Its orientation is British;\nthough American English is occasionally mentioned, the punctuation\nof the text is British in style, and the language and style\ndescribed is mainly British.  For instance, <em>classified</em> is described\nas “a contraction of classified as secret”; in American English\n(at least), it means “classified as confidential, secret, top secret,\netc.”  The comment under <em>differ from/with</em> concerning <em>different/differently</em>\nwith <em>to/from</em> illustrates a typically British usage:\nAmericans may say “different than,” but they are rarely heard\nto say “different to,” which is British.  The pronunciation of\n<em>muezzin</em>, given as rhyming with “Dewey's in,” is not verifiable\nin any American dictionary I checked or in <em>Collins English\nDictionary</em>.  Other pronunciations are also odd: that of <em>crochet,</em>\nfor instance; the comment that <em>depot</em> is pronounced in American\nEnglish as DEE'POE (how about the WWII <em>repple-depot</em>?);\n<em>mezzanine</em> is never pronounced <em>metsa-</em> in the U.S.; only British\n*r-*less pronunciations (HAWD for <em>hoard/horde</em>) are shown.  Other\nproblems: <em>Celluloid</em> is still a trademark (in the U.S.), where\n<em>hoover</em> for 'use a vacuum cleaner' is not used; the objection to\n<em>hopefully</em> is by no means confined to Britain; <em>alternate</em> is not\nstressed on the second syllable (when used as a verb) in\nAmerica.</p>\n<p>There are many other matters that could be taken up here.\nWere it not for the publication of this book in America (where\nit contains too many inaccuracies to be useful), it might be\npassed off as unworthy of comment.  But the inaccuracies about\nAmerican English are a serious disservice to British readers, as\nwell, making the work of dubious value on either side of the\npond.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
