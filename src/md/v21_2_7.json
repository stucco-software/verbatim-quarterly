Dougherty</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Santa Fe</span></em></p>\n<p>I was amused and bemused by Martyn Ecott's <em>The Franglais Blues</em> [XX, 3]. My bemusement led to my wondering how many English words in the story of <em>youpie</em> Marc, where the vocabulary has been selected to illustrate the relentless incursion of English expressions into modern French, were borrowed into English from French, either the Old, Anglo-, Middle, or Modern language. Here is a copy of Martyn Ecott's little story, with the Franglais expressions left in italics but with the English morphemes originally borrowed from French underlined in the mainly English text. My etymological authority is the <em>Random House Dictionary of the English Language</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A friend of mine, let's call him Marc, was finishing his work for the day. He consulted his <em>agenda</em> 'diary, appointment book' to check whether he was keeping to his <em>planning</em> 'schedule.' His <em>listing</em> 'computer printout list' helps him keep track of his customers and is used by his secretary for <em>un mailing</em> 'despatch of letters; mail drop.' He picked up his <em>brake</em> (Brit. shooting brake) Brit. 'estate car,' US 'station wagon' from the <em>parking</em> (-lot) and drove home. It had been raining so he had to avoid <em>un aquaplaning</em> 'skid' on the slippery surface. Marc is a bit of a <em>youpie</em> 'yuppie' and has to ensure he is keeping his <em>standing</em> 'social status.' He has his own <em>box</em> 'private garage.' His home, too, is <em>standing</em> 'conferring status,' as is his wife who regularly has her <em>lifting</em> 'face-lift' to make sure she is sufficiently <em>liftée</em> to face up to his friends. She does not want to be <em>snobée</em> 'looked down upon.' He himself goes in for a <em>brushing</em> 'blow-wave.'</p>\n<p>Their house not only has a sizable <em>living</em> (-room), but also <em>un dressing</em> (-room). For dinner he will put on his <em>smoking</em> 'dinner jacket, tuxedo,' though he really prefers to be in by driving the kids down to a <em>snack</em> (-bar), <em>un fast</em> (probably <em>un Mac Do</em>) for <em>un big</em> (-Mac) or <em>un cheese</em> (-burger) with <em>French</em> (-fries). If the kids have been good he might buy them <em>un pin's</em> (no, not possessive in French!)—<em>un badge</em> would be too passé. Sometimes a <em>magnet's</em> 'fridge magnet,' (again not a possessive) might be given away. The kids are very <em>hip hop</em> (they like “rap” music) and spend most of their time on their <em>skate</em> (-board). But their parents do not mind. Anything, as long as they do not <em>se shooter</em> 'take drugs,' not just shoot up like some children their age. But, unlike other children, they do have <em>une nurse</em> 'nanny' to look after them.</p>\n<p>By the end of the week Marc is completely <em>stone</em> 'dog tired,' so he just wants to get away from it all. Saturdays and Sundays the family spends time at <em>le week-end</em> 'weekend retreat, holiday home' by the sea, and the <em>bobtail</em> 'Old English sheepdog' gets more exercise than in town. Marc gets his exercise by putting on his <em>baskets</em> 'training shoes' and probably <em>un training or un jogging</em> 'track suit' and goes out for <em>un footing</em> 'a jog.'</p>\n<p>In the meantime, his wife pops along to the local <em>self</em> 'self-service market' for her favorite: <em>un cake</em> (only ever <em>fruitcake</em>). To work that off, she gets her exercise down at <em>le fitness</em> 'gym.' She also wears <em>baskets</em>, but with <em>un body stretch fluo</em> 'fluorescent elasticated leotard.' During the warm-up, she will wear <em>un sweat</em> 'sweatshirt.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this calculatedly selective text I count only a few more Franglais words or morphemes, forty-four, than English morphemes originally, in most cases centuries ago, borrowed from French, forty by my count. However, of the sixty-six words in the closing paragraph of the article, where the language is not artificially loaded, I find seven words derived from French, including <em>Académie</em>, which is French, but not a single word of Franglais, nor would any Franglais expression appear in the paragraph were it translated into French. The current balance of trade may be in favor of English, but overall it is clearly still heavily in favor of French.</p>\n<p>As Martyn Ecott cleverly demonstrates, francophone purists have reason for alarm; the flow, absolute flood of vocabulary from French into English, once resulting in a kind of hybridization, has lately been somewhat reversed, depositing in the elegant French language such grotesque neologisms as un pin's or hip hop. Certainly, though, most of these freaks will be dislodged and swept away by the passage of time while those already rooted in the French language, like smoking and week-end, have become naturalized and no longer jar in the Gallic ear. The real threat to the French language is not that some faddish expressions and technical terms are invading French. No, the real menace, already almost a fait accompli, is that English will replace French altogether in science and technology, commerce, and international communication. At the present rate, French, which still appears along with English in my American passport and which sometimes still fills full-page ads in The New Yorker, may wind up like Greek—a language providing access to the roots of world culture but hardly worth learning for the conduct of mundane affairs.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
