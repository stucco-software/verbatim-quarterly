I have been collecting such\nloanwords for several years with a view to using them eventually\nas the basis for an article in VERBATIM, a project that\nobviously is now no longer feasible.  Moreover, I must admit\nthat the length of Mr. Cannon's list makes mine a dwarf by\ncomparison.  However, in checking his list against mine, I found\na number of words on mine that had eluded him, namely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>catan (or cattan)<br>\ngaimusho<br>\ngyakura<br>\nikehana<br>\nkabure<br>\nkanagugui<br>\nkoku<br>\nmachi<br>\nmaru<br>\nmarumi<br>\nmatsucoccus<br>\nmishima<br>\nrotenone<br>\nsami<br>\nshoka<br>\ntorafugu<br>\nyatobyo<br>\nyeki<br>\nyukon</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After studying Cannon's list carefully, I concluded that his\ntitle was somewhat misleading.  He actually lists fewer than 698\nloanwords, since a number of his entries are merely variant\nspellings of the same words.  I noted, for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>gingko<br>\nginkgo<br>\njinricksha<br>\njinriksha<br>\njinrikshaw<br>\njiujitsu<br>\njujitsu<br>\nkeyaki<br>\nkiaki<br>\nNo<br>\nnoh<br>\noban<br>\nobang<br>\nricksha<br>\nrickshaw<br>\nrikisha<br>\nsamisen<br>\nsamsien<br>\nShin<br>\nShin-shu<br>\nshoyu<br>\nsoy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I must also question whether all the words listed by\nCannon are really Japanese loanwords.  All the sources I\nconsulted gave Alaskan Indian as the origin of <em>hooch</em> and\n<em>hootch</em> (variant spellings, in any case).  The same sources\nattributed <em>skimmia</em> to New Latin and described <em>Taka-Diastase</em>\nas a trademark, without stating, unfortunately, whence the\ntrademark came (admittedly the <em>taka</em> could be Japanese in\norigin; I must confess ignorance on that point).  Also, one of my\nsources attributed <em>mebos</em> to Afrikaans, <em>probably</em> (my italics)\nfrom the Japanese <em>umeboshi</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally, as a matter of possible interest to VERBATIM\nreaders, I might note that some of the loanwords cited by\nCannon are actually Chinese in origin, that is, they had been\nborrowed by Japanese from Chinese before English borrowed\nthem from Japanese.  They include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amidism (<em>et al.</em>)<br>\nansu<br>\nchanoyu<br>\ngingko<br>\njudo<br>\njujitsu<br>\noban<br>\nri<br>\nsamisen<br>\nsen<br>\nseppuku<br>\nsoya (<em>et al.</em>)<br>\nTendai<br>\ntycoon<br>\nyen<br>\nZen</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Robert Devereux, Falls Church, Virginia]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
