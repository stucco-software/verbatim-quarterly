Then it was applied to a 'district with distinct\ncharacteristics of its own'—<em>chalk country, fen country,\nsheep country, corn country</em>—or to a 'district limited or\ndefined by human occupation, e.g. owned by the same lord\nor inhabited by a specific group of people.'  In this sense\nmen spoke of <em>O'Neil Country</em> or <em>Lochiel's Country</em>.  Two\nfarmers, living perhaps three or four miles apart, might\nmeet each other and enquire, “What's the news in you\ncountry?”  Two parishes might be spoken of as different\n<em>countries</em> in this sense of the word, certainly countries were\nso described: “In Leycestershyre, Lankesshyre, Yorkeshyre\n... and manye other countreyes,” wrote Fitzherbert in 1.     When the Prodigal Son “took his journey into a far\ncountry,” there is no reason to suppose that he left his native\nland; the Greek word which <em>country</em> here translates similarly\nmeant simply 'district, region, or place.'</p>\n<p>Today, of course, we generally apply the word to a\n'land under a particular government or inhabited by a particular\nethnic or linguistic group'—“To bee of one countrie,\nof one nation, of one language,” as Grimalde wrote in\n1553—or else to 'rural regions or farming districts as opposed\nto the city.'  In Cowper's frequently quoted saying,\n“God made the country, and man made the town.”</p>\n<p>The specialized uses of the word are numerous: as a\nmining term <em>country</em> signifies the 'rock on each side of a\nlode;' as a nautical expression, a 'region of the ocean, or\naboard ship, an area for common use,' like <em>steerage country\nor wardroom country;</em> in cricket slang, the 'part of the field\nwhich is remote from the wicket.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
