It\nwould be superfluous to point out omissions like <em>strickle</em>, which\nwould have helped explain <em>struck measure</em> (described under\n<em>heaped measure</em>, p. 165), or stylistic slips like <em>sawed</em> for <em>sawn</em>,\nso I shall control myself.  I cannot, however, refrain from\ncriticizing the absence of a useful index—unforgivable in a\nbook arranged into 52 alphabetic sets—or from execrating the\nplainly bad practice of capitalizing every entry word: How can\none tell whether a word is normally capitalized or not?  But\nthose failings must be laid in the lap of the publisher's editor.\nTo Mr. Dickson we must be grateful for a most pleasurable\nromp through the nether reaches of the English lexicon.</p>\n<p><em>—Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
