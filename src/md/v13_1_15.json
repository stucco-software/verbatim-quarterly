Schur</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Weston, Connecticut</span></em></p>\n<p>In his mercilessly denunciatory poem <em>English Bards\nand Scotch Reviewers</em>, Byron wrote of critics\n“with just enough of learning to misquote.”  Some\ntwenty centuries earlier, Publilius Syrus, in his <em>Sententiae</em>\n(Maxims), advised: “Better be ignorant of a\nmatter than half know it,” a sentiment echoed in Jefferson's\n<em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em> when he wrote,\n“Ignorance is preferable to error,” and again by Dickens\nin <em>Sketches by Boz:</em> “A smattering of everything\nand a knowledge of nothing.”  Pope, in his <em>Essay on\nCriticism</em>, capped it all with “A little learning is a\ndangerous thing,” itself usually misquoted “A little\n<em>knowledge</em>....”  Oscar Wilde wrote: “A poet can\nsurvive everything but a misprint,” and he might have\nadded, “or a misquote”; and even that witticism is\noften misquoted, “A poet can survive <em>anything</em>....”\nSo let us proceed to a dismal collection of grating misquotations.</p>\n<p>“The best laid schemes o' mice an' men,” wrote\nBurns, “Gang aft a-gley,” echoing the truth expressed\na hundred years earlier in Ihara Saikaku's <em>Japanese\nFamily Storehouse:</em>  “There is always something to\nupset the most careful of human calculations,”\nand anticipating the modern Murphy's Law (known\nin Britain as “Sod's Law” and in France as “La\nloi d'emmerdement maximum”).  But poor Burns's\n“schemes” are all too often misquoted “plans,” and the\ncontractions “o' ” and “an' ” usually come out as “of”\nand “and.”  (Even <em>Bartlett</em> distorts the “an' ” to “and”!)</p>\n<p>“Water, water, everywhere,” groaned the ancient\nmariner, “Nor any drop to drink.”  The “Nor any”\ncomes out as “And not a” as an improvement on Coleridge\nmost of the time.</p>\n<p>Portia, in <em>The Merchant of Venice,</em> cries: “How\nfar that little candle throws his beams!” but “his”\nbecomes “its” and “beams” turns up as “light” on the\nlips of some who would quote the Bard and should\nknow better.  And in the same play, the Prince of\nMorocco never said, “All that <em>glitters</em> is not gold”; <em>glisters</em>\nwas the word.  Gray got it right, in his <em>Ode on\nthe Death of a Favourite Cat,</em> when he swiped the\nline from Shakespeare: “Not all that tempts your\nwand'ring eyes/And heedless hearts, is lawful prize;/\nNor all, that glisters, gold.”</p>\n<p>Does pride go before a fall?  No: according to\n<em>Proverbs,</em> XVI, 18, “Pride goeth before <em>destruction,</em>\nand an <em>haughty spirit</em> before a fall.”</p>\n<p>It is in <em>King John</em> that Salisbury says to the king:\n“To gild refined gold, to <em>paint</em> the lily/ ... Is wasteful\nand ridiculous excess.”  Nothing about gilding lilies.</p>\n<p>And Everett never wrote about “Great oaks” or\n“Big oaks:” what he said was “<em>Tall</em> oaks from little\nacorns grow.”</p>\n<p>“How doth the little busy bee/Improve each shining\nhour,” exclaimed Watts, but it's the “busy little\nbee” we keep hearing about.  And it isn't money that is\nthe root of all evil: Paul, in his <em>First Epistle to Timothy,</em>\nrightly said:  “The <em>love of money</em> is the root of all\nevil.”</p>\n<p>Finally, Holmes never said, “Elementary, my\ndear Watson.”  He addressed his friend and colleague\nas “my dear Watson,” and when he felt unduly\npraised, he said, “Elementary,” but he never put the\ntwo together.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
