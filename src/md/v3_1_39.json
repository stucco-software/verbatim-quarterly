Ovid's tale of Apollo and Daphne is given as evidence that “Cupid's leaden arrow is sensual passion.”</p>\n<p>Not so.  According to Ovid, when Apollo spoke scornfully of Cupid as a bowman, Cupid in revenge shot a golden arrow into Apollo, which inflamed him with love for Daphne.  But Cupid pierced Daphne with a leaden arrow, which made her desperately flee Apollo's love and develop an aversion to the very word <em>lover</em>.</p>\n<p>Curiously enough, <em>Brewer</em> conveniently prints accurately in Latin the key passage from Ovid, but both the <em>Brewer</em> editor and your reviewer must not have read it or noticed the crucial word <em>fugat</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> is equally unsupportive in the matter of virtue.  Along with swearing by Cupid's golden arrow, Hermia swears “by the fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen.”  In the case of Dido as in that of Apollo, it is quite evidently the intensity and irresistibility of the love caused by Cupid's golden arrow that counts, and not any distinction between the sensual and the virtuous.  <em>[Robert Gorham Davis, Columbia University]</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/stx_Verbatim_The_Language_Quarterly_v3n1_1976-05\">Internet Archive copy of this issue</a></p>",
