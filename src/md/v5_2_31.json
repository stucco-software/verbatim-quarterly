The emphasis is on\nnineteenth-century creations, designed so as to meet the needs\nof “genteel” middle-class Victorians.  (It was indeed the Victorians\nwho gave <em>genteel</em> a bad name, and today, “the word is\nused mockingly in reference to that era's obsolete standards of\nfalse refinement.”)</p>\n<p>The material is drawn from both British and American\nexperience and carries a concluding chapter on Newspeak,\nbringing our inherited euphemisms up to date: it claims that\nBritain has still a long way to go “before she becomes as\nenmeshed in this sort of language as the United States.”  Lawrence\nthen goes on to quote such topicals as <em>mopping up\noperations</em> and <em>protective manoeuvres</em> for 'napalm bomb\nraids.'</p>\n<p>From our side of the Atlantic, I would doubt this charge,\nand if the heyday of euphemisms is past, its popularity is well\nin evidence as <em>garden flat</em> (situated at shady basement level)\nand <em>Adult books</em> (as advertised in certain Soho shop windows)\nbear ready witness.</p>\n<p><em>[Simon Smith, Nantwich, England]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
