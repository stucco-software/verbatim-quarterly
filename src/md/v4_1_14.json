Eric Partridge attributes\nthe first part, Kuklux, to a distortion of the Greek\n<em>kyklos</em>, 'circle.'  The deliberate distortion, and the use of K's\nand x's were intended to make the name more mysterious\nand frightening, but it merely meant 'Circle Clan' to start.</p>\n<p>But that very word <em>kyklos</em> was the origin of the Yiddish\n<em>keikel</em>.  Most Yiddish words come from German, but circle\nin German is <em>Zirkel</em> or <em>Kreis</em>; this word <em>keikel</em> goes back to\nthe Jewish dialect Yevanic, analogous to Yiddish, except\nthat the vocabulary was Greek, rather than German.  Like\nYiddish, the written language used Hebrew characters.</p>\n<p>In fact, during the long years of the diaspora, the wandering\nJews have had a dozen dialects, written in Hebrew\nletters, but with words derived from the language of their\ncurrent (or previous) hosts.  Thus a book which looks like\nHebrew may actually be in Persian, Arabic, Berber, Greek,\nFrench or Provencal, Italian or Spanish.  The latter, called\nLadino, is still spoken and even written, today.  It's a wide,\nwide circle.</p>",
