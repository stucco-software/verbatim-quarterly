I copy them—\nalong with other verbal litter—onto scraps of paper\nwhich I have not yet learned to organize.  Many are\nlost; resupply, however, is good.  The people, the\npress, the air, they are all generous—to a fault.  In\ncompany, my wife usually senses when I am about to\nsay the wrong thing.  If close enough, she nudges me,\nunobtrusively and usually gently.  But after I say it,\nher nudge, usually not gentle, is no longer a warning.\nIt is too late.  Yet you will hear statements like, “I am\nwarning you in advance.”  “In advance” is a sick\nappendix: surgery is indicated.  Advertisers continually\noffer “free gifts.”  Since a gift is a free offering, “free\ngift” translates to “free free offering.”  Do not, however,\nbe carried away by propriety.  Take the gift,\neven if it is free free.</p>\n<p>More phrases that did not know when to stop:</p>\n<p><em>toxic poison</em>\n<em>it will recur again</em>\n<em>he voluntarily signed a note of his own volition:</em> Spoken by\nan immigration officer.  Of course it was uttered in the\nofficial monotone and length which denotes objectivity\nand a dutiful presentation of every detail.</p>\n<p><em>the bottles split and burst</em>\n<em>the market will take a dive down</em>\n<em>at least ten years ago or more</em>\n<em>new innovation</em>\n<em>returned back</em>\n<em>let us join together in prayer:</em> I must admit that it is better\nthan to join apart.  How much more effective is “Let us\njoin in prayer” or, simple and powerful, “Let us pray.”\nLet us—for the language.</p>\n<p><em>internationally acclaimed all over the world</em></p>\n<p>I have thrown a boomerang.  My friends now collect\nredundancies for me.  That much is good.  But they\nhave also developed incredibly sharp ears for the ones\nI commit.  I am beginning to suspect that there is no\none to throw the first stone.  Why—in varying degrees,\nof course—are we all so afflicted?  Perhaps we work\novertime in order to make certain that others understand\nour brilliant thoughts.  Perhaps we fear that if\nwe stop talking we will have to start listening.  Perhaps\nit goes back to those teachers who were more interested\nin how many pages we filled than in what we\nsaid.</p>\n<p>But nothing is devoid of grace.  Years ago a Milwaukee\noptometrist displayed a sign that many have\nsince imitated: EYES EXAMINED WHILE YOU WAIT.  I\nmust tell my barber about that.</p>",
