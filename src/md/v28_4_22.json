Other examples may be explained their being in a language other than English (of course, <em>sheik</em> is one), e.g., <em>Pleiades</em> (likewise an exception because of its being in two syllables that separate the <em>e</em> from the <em>i</em>, <em>beige</em> (also a “double”), <em>Zeitgeist,</em> <em>vermeil,</em> and <em>kaleidoscopic</em>. In fact, if all of Pat Sheil's examples are examined under one (or more) of the above standards, I believe there will be a minimum of horrorifics.</p>\n<p>Best regards anyway,</p>\n<p><em>[Berthold M. Levy, Melrose Park, Pennsylvania]</em></p>\n<p><em>[This is, of course, entirely true, but takes all the fun out of it. —Ed.]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
