Written by an associate professor of Linguistics at University of Califor-nia-Berkeley, it sat on the shelf for a while (despite the attractive cover design) before I managed to pick it up. When I did, I was pleasantly surprised. A well-written and engaging book, it is also the linguistics equivalent of a page-turner, as unlikely as that may be.</p>\n<p>McWhorter has an involving writing style and uses some wonderful metaphors to get his points across. (I was especially fond of his comparing English to a lava lamp.) Although the lamp is constantly changing, he writes, “In no sense is the clump of lava decaying—if one piece is beginning to drip or split into strands . . . other pieces are joining together.”</p>\n<p>The real strength of the book, however, is his common-sense yet linguistically sound takes on some of the most controversial language topics of the day, including gender-neutral pronouns, the grammar police, and “The Tragedy of Shakes-pearean Language” (or why Johnny doesn't enjoy King Lear.) A full third of the book is given over to the Ebonics controversy in California, and there McWhorter shines in his analysis and commentary.</p>\n<p>He describes the problem so well and discusses the roles of the players and their theories so intelligently that I am wary of giving away too much of the pleasure of reading it by going into his conclusions here. Suffice it to say that this was the first writing on the topic that left me feeling truly enlightened and not just lobbied.</p>\n<p>McWhorter is also kind enough to include a thoughtfully annotated bibliography and a good index to the book as well.</p>\n<p>Certainly, I would search this book out right away—don't leave it on the shelf as long as I did!</p>\n<p><em>Erin McKean</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
