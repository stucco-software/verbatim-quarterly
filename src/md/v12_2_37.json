Such bastardizations are apparently considered\nvery chic (not pronounced like the brand of jeans) by the\nMadison Avenue trendy-setters.  While we might accept them\nas quaint little leaps of imagination, we wonder how one\ndetermines that <em>Car</em> and <em>Bag</em> are masculine and <em>Shake</em>\nfeminine.</p>\n<p>Readers of VERBATIM are encouraged to send to the\neditor's attention other examples of linguistic hybrids that they\nhave read or heard frequently.  Please exclude from consideration\nnonce uses and legal Latinisms such as “writ of <em>habeas\ncorpus</em>.”  Combinations involving English and foreign languages\nother than Latin or French would be particularly appreciated.\nContributions will appear in future issues.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
