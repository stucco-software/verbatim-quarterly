Plain English is a must. I don't mean you should talk down to them, but you are hurting your cause if you cloak your thoughts in strange garments. You may have seen that this second paragraph is made up mostly of everyday Anglo-Saxon words; yet you can tell what I mean, I hope, just as well as you could in the first paragraph.</p>\n<p>Time and again I have observed lawyers evoke their hostility or bafflement by unnecessarily using fancy words instead of plain ones. Here are some recurrent samples:</p>\n<p>{{&lt; column &gt;}}\n{{}} Actual Usage {{}}\n{{}}  Plain Usage {{}}\n{{}} subsequent to {{}}\n{{}}  after {{}}\n{{}} prior to, antecedent to {{}}\n{{}}  before {{}}\n{{}} rationale {{}}\n{{}}  reason(s) {{}}\n{{}} conjecture, speculate {{}}\n{{}}  guess {{}}\n{{}} converse {{}}\n{{}}  talk {{}}\n{{}} interrogate {{}}\n{{}}  question {{}}\n{{}} hypothesize {{}}\n{{}}  suppose, let's say {{}}\n{{}} in the vicinity of {{}}\n{{}}  near(by) {{}}\n{{}} approximately {{}}\n{{}}  about, around {{}}\n{{}} audible {{}}\n{{}}  aloud, out loud {{}}\n{{}} perceptible, visible {{}}\n{{}}  in (plain) sight, noticeable {{}}\n{{}} negligent {{}}\n{{}}  careless {{}}\n{{}} preponderance {{}}\n{{}}  greater weight {{}}\n{{}} stipulate, acquiesce,concur {{}}\n{{}}  agree, go along with {{}}\n{{}} emphasize {{}}\n{{}}  stress {{}}\n{{}} (substantially) contemporaneous {{}}\n{{}}  about the same time {{}}\n{{}} equitable {{}}\n{{}}  fair {{}}\n{{}} aggregate of, totality of {{}}\n{{}}  all {{}}\n{{}} totality of circumstances {{}}\n{{}}  whole picture {{}}\n{{}} employment {{}}\n{{}}  work {{}}\n{{}} (earned) compensation {{}}\n{{}}  pay {{}}\n{{}} participate {{}}\n{{}}  take part {{}}\n{{}} voluntary {{}}\n{{}}  willing {{}}\n{{}} intentional, deliberate {{}}\n{{}}  on purpose {{}}\n{{}} intend to {{}}\n{{}}  mean to {{}}\n{{}} supersede {{}}\n{{}}  replace {{}}\n{{&lt;/ column &gt;}}</p>\n<p>You can no doubt think of dozens of other examples. This vice, which I might label “ornamental opacity,” probably results from years of saturation with professional jargon in college and law school. We lawyers are supposed to be masters of the art of communication. So let's escape from the shackles of academic obscurantism, and assume a special responsibility for plain talk and lucid writing.</p>\n<p>The first goal should be to weed out these round-about—Oops, I almost said “periphrastic”—ways of putting simple thoughts into words.</p>\n<p>This article first appeared in the <em>California State Bar Journal</em>, from which it is reprinted by permission.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ted Bear, Historian, Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards, California, wrote to enquire whether <em>an</em> or <em>a</em> is to be used in a parenthetical construction like “...an (unspecified) number of years ago.” We've been perplexed about this problem too, but a long time ago we decided that because the construction is what might be called a “visual colloquial” form, <em>an</em> would be preferred to <em>a</em>. Similarly, “a (new) auditorium.” In such cases, the parentheses around the word or expression are “weak” and are intended only for visual effect.</p>\n<p><em>Editor</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
