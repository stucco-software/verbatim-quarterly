If Howard\nwanted to show his loyalty to pal Enright by taking a swipe at\nMaledicta, why didn't he act like a man and use the copy I\nairmailed to him?  Instead, coward Howard, the author of\nWeasel Words, shows his character by weaseling out and\nquoting Enright's drivel: “Maledicta calls itself 'The International\nJournal of Verbal Aggression' ... It sees itself as a band\nof frank, gallant and daring intellects ...” Good show, professor\n&amp; poet Enright!  Your antecedent is a bit off: it refers to the\njournal and can't also refer to a group of people, poetic license\nnotwithstanding.</p>\n<p>Aside from this gross lapsus grammaticus, the poet is all\nwrong: none of “our band” has ever called himself or herself\nan “intellect,” as Howard and chums are wont to do for each\nother.  The rest of his quotation is too silly to waste ink on.  But\nif this is Enright “in typical form,” you might well think twice\nbefore shelling out £12.50 or about $20.00 for 211 pages of\nstale huffing &amp; puffing by a passé poet.</p>\n<p>As my friends in business assure me, “The only bad\npublicity is no publicity.”  So, the $5.82 postage I wasted on\nairmailing a copy of Maledicta to Philip Howard wasn't a total\nloss.</p>\n<p><em>[Reinhold Aman, Ph.D., Maledicta]</em></p>",
