Arthur Schlesinger in <em>Learning\nHow to Behave</em> (1947) summarizes the advice of pre-Civil\nWar writers on language etiquette as follows, “When conversing...pains\nshould be taken not to remind one's companions\nof their plebeian origins....

He did not, however, initiate\nor enter into a conversation unless addressed.”  In private, there\nwere undoubtedly exceptions to the above, but when several\nwhites were gathered, blacks generally stood, hat in hand, and\nremained silent.</p>\n<p>While social intercourse between whites and blacks was\napparently ignored by the standard bearers of etiquette, the\ndiscourse of young ladies was not.  In 1859 Miss Elisa Leslie\noffered some very specific advice concerning “the phraseology\nof females,” who had evidently fallen under the influence of\n“nurses and servants.”  Miss Leslie suggests that one avoid\n“monstrous glad” when one means “very glad”; avoid “turn\nout the tea” when one means “pour the tea,” and avoid “braid\nthe eggs” when one means “beat” them.  The list below\nsummarizes her advice.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>AVOID</th>\n<th>USE</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>admire</td>\n<td>like</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>beat out</td>\n<td>tired</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cunning</td>\n<td>pretty, dainty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>down cellar</td>\n<td>down in the cellar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>drunk</td>\n<td>awry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>dump</td>\n<td>put down</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>emptyings</td>\n<td>yeast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>floored</td>\n<td>disconcerted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>gale</td>\n<td>fit of laughter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ice-ball</td>\n<td>snow-ball</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>“I love oysters.”</td>\n<td>“I like oysters.”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kate (etc.)</td>\n<td>Katherine (etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>“I live to Newark.”</td>\n<td>“I live at Newark.”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>mayhap</td>\n<td>perhaps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>muss</td>\n<td>mess</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pin-ball</td>\n<td>pin-cushion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>“Pork is not healthy.”</td>\n<td>“Pork is not wholesome”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rich</td>\n<td>comic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>seedy</td>\n<td>faded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>snooze</td>\n<td>nap</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>stoop</td>\n<td>porch, door-step</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>trade</td>\n<td>exchange</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ugly</td>\n<td>bad-tempered</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The post-Civil War era saw prescribers of etiquette turning\nmuch of their attention to affected elegance, though certain\nindelicacies were still proscribed.  Schlesinger summarizes the\npost-war advice saying that long words, high-sounding phrases,\n“and other ways of showing off should be sternly repressed if\none wish[es] to avoid the <em>faux pas</em> of the lady who, being asked\nwhether she had seen the Dardanelles while abroad, replied,\n'Oh, yes; we dined with them several times.' ”</p>\n<p>Concerning the use of slang during this time, Richard A.\nWells in <em>Manners, Culture</em>, and <em>Dress</em> (1894) counsels that “all\nslang is vulgar” and should not be mistaken as “a substitute for\nwit,” for it lowers “the tone of society and the standard of\nthought.”  Concerning the double entendre, “A well-bred person\nalways refuses to understand a phrase of double meaning.”\nShould one chance to hear an indelicate word, “Then not the\nshadow of a smile should flit across the lips.”  And should a\ngentleman converse with a lady, he should pay her “the\ncompliment of seeming to consider [her] capable of an equal\nunderstanding with gentlemen.”</p>\n<p>Such condescension receives some comeuppance in Francis\nW. Crowninshield's <em>Manners for the Metropolis</em> (1908).\nCrowninshield, who edited <em>Vanity Fair</em> for many years and\nwho was an urbane member of New York society, nimbly and\nsuccinctly deflates the stuffed-shirt snobbery and pretensions of\nthe smart set.  Among his ironic aphoristic pieces of advice are\n“Try to remember that there are only two kinds of plays and\nnovels—they are either 'bully' or 'rotten,' ” and, “It is not\nmodish to speak kindly to the servants....  In addressing them,\nsimply say: 'Where the devil are my boots?'...Remember\nthat they get even' in the servants' hall.”  Tongue in cheek,\nCrowninshield advises finally that a man should avoid calling\nthe wine “the fizz,” and his wife “his mother.”  Other phrases\nto be dutifully avoided are “Pardon my glove” and “Pray rest\nyour cane.”</p>\n<p>Following the First World War, there was a great relaxed\nsigh that permeated the stuffest of etiquette books, which\ncontinued to be in demand; over sixty were published in the\n1920s alone.</p>\n<p>As typical of the new relaxed mood, Schlesinger cites the\nfollowing as representative, “As for men swearing before ladies,\none college youth adjured his fellows, 'Try not to,' while\nanother observed, 'If they say <em>damn</em>, so do I, when useful.”'\nStill, while some post-war guides sanctioned <em>swell, sweetie pie,\ntaxi, flivver, movies, hunch, flapper</em>, and <em>the blues</em>, others\nremained quite prescriptive.  The list below, drawn from Martens's\n<em>The Book of Good Manners</em>, Richardson's <em>Standard\nEtiquette</em>, and Eichler's <em>The New Book of Etiquette</em>, all published\nduring the 1920s, gives a representative sample of words\nand phrases to be avoided.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>AVOID</th>\n<th>USE</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>beastly</td>\n<td>nasty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bred and born</td>\n<td>born and bred</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bum</td>\n<td>waster</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>chin music</td>\n<td>talk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>dander</td>\n<td>anger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>dinge</td>\n<td>Negro</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>dippy</td>\n<td>foolish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>durst</td>\n<td>dare</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>elegant house</td>\n<td>handsome house</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>fresh</td>\n<td>impudent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>geezer</td>\n<td>elderly man</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>genteel</td>\n<td>well-bred</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>“He's a case.”</td>\n<td>“He is odd.”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>murderous</td>\n<td>deadly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>nerve</td>\n<td>independence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>“No flies on her.”</td>\n<td>“She's very clever.”</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sheeny</td>\n<td>Jew</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>show</td>\n<td>play</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>tony</td>\n<td>stylish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>vest</td>\n<td>waistcoat</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Frederick H. Martens in <em>The Book of Good Manners</em>\n(1924) goes a step beyond the above general proscriptions and\nforbids the following “vulgar elegancies”: <em>alleviated poverty,\nbanquet, effluvium, felicitate, lassitudinous, lineament, liquid\nrefreshment</em>, and <em>ventilate</em> in the sense of 'explain.'</p>\n<p>Since the 1930s, writers of etiquette books have generally\navoided specific recommendations of diction like those above\nand offered instead very general advice that few would quarrel\nwith.  Llewellyn Miller in <em>The Encyclopedia of Etiquette</em> (1967)\ndoes inveigh against euphemisms like “in a family way,”\n“expectorate,” and “lavatory” and such gobbledygook as, “finalize\nan undertaking.”  But Charlotte Ford is more typical of\nrecent writers.  She states that “conversation is like a dance, in\nthat one partner leads and the other follows, the difference\nbeing that the roles of leader and follower shift continuously.”</p>\n<p>Of all the contemporary etiquette advisers, Elizabeth L.\nPost seems to be the most prescriptive, yet compared to Miss\nLeslie, she is mild indeed.  Concerning pronunciation, “cherce”\nfor <em>choice</em> is not acceptable, while “wawsh” for <em>wash</em> is.  “A\nmarkedly local accent,” she warns, might suggest to some “a\nmind limited to that particular locality and uninformed about\nthe broader issues.”  And while “coarse or profane words are\nunnecessary,” slang, she notes, can be an asset to your\nconversation.  A few terms are proscribed (“drapes” for <em>draperies</em>,\n“reckon” for <em>think</em>, “folks” for <em>family</em>, and “party” for\n<em>person</em>), but generally she advises, “Everything that is simple\nand direct is better form than the cumbersome and\npretentious.”</p>\n<p>Of course every generation would agree with this last\nstatement by Ms. Post, but each has its own definition of the\ncumbersome and pretentious.  To be sure, linguistic codes\nquickly outlive their usefulness, but reviewing them can throw\nmuch light on the growth and direction of contemporary\nlanguage.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
