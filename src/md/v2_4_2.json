The editors of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> etymologized, with evident dubiety, to the effect that <em>aubergine</em> is the diminutive of French <em>auberge</em>.  Any traveler knows that in France an <em>auberge</em> is an inn, but we are told in the <em>O.E.D</em>., on the alleged authority of the great French lexicographer, Littré, that in this fruity and enigmatic case, “auberge” is a variant of “alberge,” a word for peach.

He states that “aubergine” derives, via Spain, from the Arabic word for eggplant, <em>al-badhinjan</em>.  This makes historical sense, and the Arabic term leads, by evident phonological processes, first to <em>alberenjena</em> (the modern Spanish word for eggplant is the same minus the Arabic definite article, <em>al: berenjena</em>), and then to aubergine.</p>\n<p>Various other kinds of documentary evidence collected by Alphonse De Candolle in his <em>Origin of Cultivated Plants</em> build a good case for believing that the eggplant itself was brought to Europe by Muslims who themselves had met with the plant in Africa no later than the dawn of the Middle Ages.
