Oxford\nUniversity Press. ISBN 0198607024. $25). As\nalways, Winchester manages to make a engaging\npage-turner out of whatever he turns his hand to,\nand the story of the <em>OED</em> is no exception. He\nsketches the huge cast of characters (from the brilliant but somewhat socially insecure Murray and the eccentric Furnivall, down to the uneducated but\ndeft-fingered slip sorters Miss Skipper and Miss\nScott) so well that it's easy to keep them straight,\nand he manages to illuminate the interesting by-thebys of the enormous project (such as the internal politics of the Press and one editor's extended\nsojourn in Chicago) without losing hold of the main\nprogression—and all this without the benefit of\nbeing able to arrange his book in alphabetical order.\nTruly a must-read for word fanatics, and a marvelous gateway book for those not yet fanatics.</p>\n<p>An unusual present, for those of you still making your lists and checking them twice (or at this point, storing up ideas for next year), would be\nLawrence Paros' <em>Bawdy Language</em> (263 pp., 225\nillustrations. 2003. Kvetch Press. ISBN\n0967200520/hardcover $26.95/0967200539 paperback $16.95). Not for children or the easily shocked, this book, subtitled “Everything you\nalways wanted to do but were afraid to say” is a collection of frankly salacious and obscene language,\namplified with attractive, if often lewd, margin\nillustrations and quotations. Two indexes, one of\npersons and works, and one of topics, plus a large\nbibliography, make this more than a curiosity. Trust\nme—that person on your list who has everything\ndoesn't have this.

(150 pp., Melville House Publishing). It's a pleasurable skewering\nof evasive language (even when it's your evasions\nthat are the ones, like, being skewered), done with\nsuch gorgeous logic and good humor that you feel\nthe terrible urge to read bits of it out loud to those\nnearest and dearest to you. Ignore that urge and\ngive those near and dear their own copies.</p>\n<p>If you have children in whose lives you play the\nrole of book-giver, you'll be encouraged to learn that\nthe late William Steig's classic, <em>CDC?</em> is now out in a\nnew color edition. (64 pp., 2003. Farrar, Straus &amp;\nGiroux. ISBN 0374312338. $16.00) <em>CDC?</em> is, of\ncourse, a series of Steigian drawings with alphabetic\ncaptions; the fun is in deciphering the captions. It's\nharder than it looks, and funnier, too.

In or out of print, old or new,\nif you have a favorite you'd like to evangelize, please\nsend word of it to us. Please include the title, author,\nand publisher, and the edition and date if known or\nessential. We already have a comprehensive list of\ndictionaries and other standard references. (In other\nwords please don't send us mail suggesting that we\nput the <em>OED</em> or the <em>Century Dictionary</em> or the <em>Word</em>\n<em>Menu</em> on the list, don't worry,we've got 'em!) We are\nhoping to find the hidden treasures and word-of-\nmouth wonders. Please share yours!</p>\n<p>If you have other suggestions for our website,\nplease let us know. We are still working on the com    plete linked and clickable online index and on having\na SIC! of the Day email or RSS feed. Other ideas are very welcome.</p>\n<p>One more note: we only accept books for\nreview in VERBATIMthat are directly related to\nlanguage. Although this is a fuzzy criterion, please\ndo not send us novels, books of literary criticism,\ntranslated works for which language learning is not\nthe main purpose, teachers' guides, workbooks, or\ndirectories. Some of these works are quite expensive (and heavy!), and we cannot return them.</p>\n<p><em>[Erin McKean]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>",
