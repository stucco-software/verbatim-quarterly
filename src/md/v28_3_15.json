One of the proudest assets of Louis\nXIV's court was his famous string orchestra, the\n“Twenty-Four;” it would have been a surprise if\nthere were no Italians among them, let alone no\nItalian violins.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup> François Couperin's <em>L'Apothéose de\nLully,</em> a trio sonata with narration describing the\nentry into heaven of Jean-Baptiste Lully, the Sun\nKing's star court composer, concludes with a reconciliation between Lully and his younger rival, the Italian composer Archangelo Corelli, with the proviso that Italian movement names be henceforth\nknown by their Gallic equivalents.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-4\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">4</a></sup> Wishful thinking\non the part of the French: Italian terminology had\nalready had a corner on the discourse of music (and\narguably how we map it onto our minds) for a century; and so it continues down to the present day.</p>\n<p>Terms referring to <em>tempo</em> 'time' include <em>allegro,</em>\n'fast' (literally, 'happy'), <em>andante</em> 'going along,' i.e. not too fast, adagio figuratively 'slow,' literally 'a\nproverb or adage,' thus by analogy, 'in a sententious\nmanner,' lento (the normal Italian word for 'slow'),\nand largo 'large,' hence 'very slowly;' allargando\nmeans 'broadening the tempo.'<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-5\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">5</a></sup> These may be further modified by appending moderato 'moderately' ma non troppo 'but not too much' or assai 'enough,'\ni.e. 'very.' Faster than allegro are (allegro) vivace\n'lively' and presto 'nimbly,' which is very fast\nindeed. Metronomes will sometimes carry scales\nindicating corresponding settings for the tempo\ndescribed in words; thus the Franz Electronic\nMetronome advises setting the quarter note equal\nto between 100 and 152 beats per minute for\npresto, 80 to 160 for vivace, 84 to 144 for allegro, 66\nto 126 for moderato, 56 to 88 for andante, 50 to 76\nfor adagio, 52 to 108 for lento, and 42 to 66 for\nlargo.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-6\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-6\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">6</a></sup> (There is considerable overlap among these\nsubjective categories.)</p>\n<p>Volume is indicated by forte 'strong, loud,' indicated in the musical score by the single italic letter f, and piano 'soft,' p in the score; the pianoforte\n(nowadays shortened to piano ) was so named\nbecause it allowed one to play both soft and loud\npassages on it without the addition of supplementary ranks of strings (as on a harpsichord—Italian (clavi)cembalo, originally 'zither with keys,' whence\nFrench clavecin, 'harpsichord') or ranks of organ\npipes.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-7\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-7\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">7</a></sup> Mezzo piano ( mf ) and mezzo forte ( mp ) are\nintermediate steps between loud and soft ( mezzo\nmeans 'middle'), louder or softer being indicated by\nsuperlatives: fortissimo, 'very loud,' represented by\nff and pianissimo ( pp ). Crescendo means 'growing\n(louder),' and diminuendo , 'diminishing (in volume),' while sforzando means 'beginning loud, dropping quickly to soft' (derived from the verb\nsforzare, 'to constrain').</p>\n<p>Since the string section is the core of most\norchestras, it may come as no surprise that there\nare a host of terms referring particularly to string\ntechnique. Pizzicato means 'plucked,' its opposite\nbeing arco, 'with the bow.' Not just the horsehaired\nside of the bow need be used, however; there is a\ntechnique called col legno, 'with the wood,' in\nwhich the strings are struck by the back of the\nbow.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-8\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-8\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">8</a></sup> Tremolo 'trembling' is produced, according\nto Laszlo Boehm, “by the extremely rapid alternation of a very short down-bow and up-bow with the upper end of the bow.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-9\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-9\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">9</a></sup> String scores include special marks for detached notes: A dot above a note\nindicates <em>spiccato</em> 'unhooked, lopped off,' a quick-\ntempo short stroke in the middle of the bow in\nwhich the bow actually bounces off the string; a\nvertical wedge over a note means <em>martellato</em> 'hammered' or <em>secco</em> 'dry,' played with short bowing and a forceful, sudden release. Other special effects in\nbowing are <em>sul ponticello</em> 'on the [little] bridge,' in\nwhich the strings are bowed very close to the\nbridge of the instrument, producing a reedy sound,\nand <em>sul tasto,</em> which means 'over the fingerboard'\n(literally 'on the touch'), producing a sound Boehm\ncalls “flute-like.”</p>\n<p><em>Con sordino</em> means 'with the mute;' this is one\nof several terms used by string players but common\nto other musicians as well. So are <em>legato</em> (literally,\n'tied,' hence 'smoothly'—the root is the same as\nthat of <em>ligature, religious,</em> and <em>obligation</em> ), <em>arpeggio</em>\na 'broken chord,' from <em>arpa,</em> 'harp,' <em>staccato</em> ('short,'\nliterally 'untied'), and glissando ('sliding,' in which\none goes from one note to the next not by discrete steps but in a continuously varying pitch.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-10\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-10\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">10</a></sup> Slide\ntrombones are particularly good at this, but the\nsame effect can also be produced by a kettledrum,\nalmost always with humorous intent.\n(Percussionists also use the terms <em>tremolo</em> and\n<em>secco,</em> the last in the special sense of 'dry and muffled;' the term <em>suffocato</em> 'suffocated' refers to damping a pair of cymbals immediately after they\nare struck.)</p>\n<p>Playing with expression is guided by a number\nof Italian terms as well: <em>cantabile</em> 'songlike,' agitato\n'agitated,' <em>con fuoco</em> 'with fire,' <em>grave</em> 'serious,'\n<em>piangendo</em> 'tearful,' and <em>espressivo</em> 'with expression'). Performance instructions include <em>da capo</em> 'from the beginning,' literally 'from the head') or\n<em>dal segno</em> 'from the sign,' i.e. a mark indicating the\nbeginning of the repeated passage) <em>al Fine</em> 'to the\nend,' generally indicated by the italicized word <em>Fine</em>\nand a double bar). First and second endings are\ndesignated respectively by <em>Prima volta</em> and <em>Secondavolta.</em> ( Volta literally means 'turn.') An additional\nsection appended after a repeated section (or, in\nsonata form, after the recapitulation) is called a\ncoda 'tail').</p>\n<p>It is to Italian that we owe the names for\ninstruments in the string section themselves. The\noriginal word viola seems to have come from\nProvençal violar, thought to be an imitative verb for\nthe sound made by a bowed stringed instrument.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-11\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-11\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">11</a></sup>\nItalian originally distinguished between the viola\nda gamba 'leg fiddle,' which had gut frets and was\nheld between the knees, and the viola da braccia\n'arm fiddle,' whose name survives both as English\nviola and in its German name, Bratsche. A little\nviola was a violino (whence violin ); a big one was a violone (now called a double bass in English and a contrabasso in Italian), and a violoncello 'little big\nviola' became shortened in English to 'cello.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-12\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-12\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">12</a></sup> (The\napostrophe is now generally omitted.) Other instruments in the string family have long ago gotten their\ngold watches and retired, such as the pocket violin\nfavored by 18th-century dancing masters and the\narpeggione, a six-stringed, bowed bass viol in guitar\ntuning, whose fleeting existence in the early 19th\ncentury would be utterly forgotten but for a single\nsplendid sonata written for the instrument by Franz\nSchubert, nowadays played on the double bass.</p>\n<p>The names for the voice parts in a choir are\nlikewise Italian: bass from bass, 'low,' tenor from\ntenore —a word nowadays carrying several meanings including 'content,' 'substance,' 'true intent,' and 'harmony' as well as the tenor part in music,\noriginally where the melody was held ( tenuto )—\nalto meaning 'high' (i.e. higher than the tenor part)\nand soprano from sopra, 'above.'<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-13\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-13\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">13</a></sup> (Note that alto\nand soprano have the masculine ending -o : Though\nthese two parts are now generally sung by women,\nthe Renaissance choir almost invariably consisted\nof men on the three lower parts—the alto part was\nin effect a high tenor line—and boys on the top.)</p>\n<p>We are also indebted to Italian for the names\ngiven to a number of forms of musical compositions: aria 'air,' fugue (the French adaptation of Italian <em>fuga,</em> 'flight,' referring to the way in which\nthe voices seem to chase one another; an entry of\ntwo voices of a fugue in close succession is referred\nto as a <em>stretto,</em> Italian for 'pressed, strict,' <em>sonata</em>\n'sounded')—of which there were originally two\nforms, the <em>sonata da chiesa</em> 'church sonata') and\n<em>sonata da camera</em> 'chamber sonata,' of which the\nlatter won out— <em>sinfonia</em> 'symphony,' <em>rondo</em> 'round,'\nso called from its returning to a single refrain in\nbetween different bridge sections), <em>menuetto</em> 'minuet.' In the evolution of the symphony from the\nbaroque dance suite the minuet was eventually\nreplaced with a <em>scherzo</em> 'pleasantry, jest,' a fast\nmovement usually in triple time—whose name is\npronounced “scairt so.”</p>\n<p>In the last century and a half, many composers\nfrom other nations began using equivalent terms in\ntheir own languages to get away from the terminological dominance of Italian. As of this writing, however, it seems unlikely that <em>moderato</em> will be\nsupplanted by French <em>paisible, espressivo</em> by\nEnglish <em>heartfelt,</em> or <em>agitato</em> by German <em>bewegt.</em> In\nconsequence, musical Italy may still boast a lasting\nterminological and conceptual victory, achieved on\nthe same principle attributed to Confederate\ncolonel Nathan B. Forrest: “Git there fustest with\nthe mostest.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-15\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-15\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">14</a></sup></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>[Nick Humez last wrote for VERBATIM on words for lies and lying.

Schütz's voluminous output is in a style that\nnicely serves as a “missing link” between the late\nRenaissance polyphony of the Gabrielis and German early\nbaroque masters such as Dietrich Buxtehude; a prime\nexample is the Schütz <em>Christmas History</em> cantata (1664),\nstill frequently performed. In England, on the other hand,\nphysical separation from the rest of Europe often made for\na time lag in cultural developments already well underway\non the Continent; thus it was not till the very end of the\n1600s that the British got the hang of writing music in the\nnew style, e.g. Henry Purcell's sword-and-sandal opera\n<em>Dido and Aeneas.</em> (Dating from 1689, the year after the\nGlorious Revolution that brought William and Mary to the\nthrone of England, it has a quaintly crashing libretto by Nahum Tate, better known for a number of psalm versifications which found their way into hymnbooks and are still sung today. The opera offers such doggerel delights as a\nchorus of witches and fiends who sing, “Destruction's our\ndelight;/Delight our greatest sorrow:/Elissa [i.e. Dido]\nbleeds tonight,/And Carthage flames tomorrow!”) <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 2\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-3\">\n<p>Cremona alone had three illustrious violin-making houses.

Archangelo Corelli, 21 years his junior, retired from\npublic life at about the same age, having exercised great\ninfluence over the musical scene at Rome as its foremost\nviolin performer and teacher; though he was by no means\na prolific composer, his work was highly influential, in part\nbecause it showed how to reconcile the formal demands of\ncontrapuntal writing with the emergence of the violin as a\nsoloistic instrument. Even the English were said to prefer\nhis music to Handel's well into the early nineteenth century. See the articles on Corelli and Lully in Stanley Sadie,\ned., The Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopedia of Music\n(New York/London: W.W.
