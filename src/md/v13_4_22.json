My wife, who lived\nmany years in Japan, tells me that its “Japanese origin”\nis taken for granted there.  The story is plausible,\nand perhaps even true.  During the years following\nAdmiral Perry's opening of Japan, many ships stopped\nin Japanese ports and the sailors on shore leave\ntrooped into the town and up into the surrounding\nhills looking for entertainment and perhaps companionship\nof sorts.  The problem was how to return to the\nship: having negotiated soberly the branching of narrow\nstreets into narrower passages in the distant\nreaches on the outward trip, the return trip in an alcoholic\nfog was less certain.  Nonetheless, once one\nreached the main street all was well, for that led\nstraight to the wharf in many of the coastal towns,\nand Yokohama in particular.  The street in question is,\nof course, <em>honcho dorii,</em> or 'main street.'
