The rationale behind referring to them as\n“lost” arises from the author's observation of an unfortunate\nstate of affairs: because of an increasingly widespread\nlack of familiarity with the basic, structural\nelements of our culture—Greek and Roman mythology,\nthe Bible, literature, and ordinary historical\nfact—people today are unable to discern the origins of\nterms like <em>aphrodisiac, Achilles [sic] heel</em> or <em>tendon,\nmeet one's Waterloo, sow dragon's teeth</em>, and <em>hand-writing\non the wall</em>, to name a few.  There are many, of\ncourse, but unaccountably, they are not the focus of\nthis book.</p>\n<p>Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions\nlike <em>sow one's wild oats</em>, about which he tells us little\nor nothing: the modern Latinate designation <em>Avena\nfatua</em> came too many centuries after the original expression\nto have any relevance to it, so why bring up\nthe information that <em>fatua</em> is Latin for 'foolish': it was\nalso Latin for 'wild,' which might be more to the\npoint.  In any event, it is hard to discern, from the arch\nstyle affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting,\njust what is the origin of <em>sow one's wild oats</em>.  In\nmany entries, Claiborne labors the obvious, offering\nlittle or nothing we do not already know, could easily\nimagine, or for which the author offers no explanation.\nAmong examples of the first are <em>spit and polish,\non the spot, on the square, stick one's neck out</em>, etc.\nExamples of the last include <em>spill the beans, square the\ncircle, stalemate</em>, etc.  Between these is an occasional\nflash of useful wisdom, much of it pretty well covered\nby other books of this type (which seem to be proliferating).</p>\n<p>What is missing, for example, at <em>square the circle</em>,\nis the information that because the area of a circle is\nmathematically calculated using <em>pi</em>, which is irrational,\nthere is no mathematical way of calculating the\ndimensions of a square with the same area as that of a\ngiven circle.  But that does not mean that such a square\ncannot exist.  As for <em>stalemate</em>, which is related to\n<em>checkmate</em>, would it not have been important to indicate\nthat the -<em>mate</em> part has nothing to do with English,\nhaving been borrowed from <em>checkmate</em> which is a\nloanword from Persian (and has nothing to do with\n<em>check</em>, either).</p>\n<p>Often, an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology\nand merely explains the meaning.  Does any\nreader need an entry like this one?</p>\n<p><em>straddle</em>.  When you straddle a horse, you've got\none leg on either side of the animal.  When a\npolitican straddles an issue, he's in much the same\nposition.</p>\n<p>Some speculative suggestions, as the derivation (or\nreinforcement) from Seidlitz powders for <em>take a powder</em>\nare sheer nonsense.  Not all entries contain misleading,\ndull, or incorrect information, but those that do\nnot are marked by a lack of originality.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
