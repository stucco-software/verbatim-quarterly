Scull</span></h1>\n<p>The following interesting incident may have escaped your notice.</p>\n<p>As Fred, a Benedict, emerged from behind the Arras to enter his Brougham waiting on the Macadam, he was wearing Jodhpurs and a Cardigan. No Beau Brummel, his Burnsides had been untouched by Occam's razor. Wearing a Panama instead of his usual Balmoral, he munched a Bologna Sandwich, drinking his Java from fine China. His faithful Boswell was a Maverick who had recently escaped the Guillotine, having been pursued by a Lynch mob who tried to Shanghai him. He was smoking a Havana while holding a half-eaten Napoleon. Just then an Amazon clad in a Bikini and accompanied by her Abigail Meandered over in her Landau drawn by a Clydesdale instead of her regular Berlin with its matched team of an Arabian and a Percheron. She said, “It's Hobson's choice, Fred. Put your John Hancock right here. Then we're going to the Mausoleum if a Bobby doesn't stop us.” Fred said “No, I won't be a Vandal. I'll Boycott such a Neanderthal notion. Besides, I'm going to the cattle show on an Annie Oakley. I'm to be the Solomon deciding between a Guernsey and a Jersey. I've just got time to pick up my Prince Albert, my Havelock, and a bottle of Cognac, but first I've got to stop at the Crapper; there may not be a John on the Pullman.” Just then the third Bohemian in a Dolly Varden pulled up in a Hackney. “My Zeppelin did a Corrigan so I had to take a Sedan instead” she explained, eating a Hamburger which she had warmed on an Etna. At this point your correspondent, feeling like a Frankenstein, left to file his story. <em>[Nominally, David H. Scull, Annandale, Virginia]</em></p>",
