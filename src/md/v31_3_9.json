None of them feature in Ivor Brown's <em>Chosen Words</em> or Eric Partridge's <em>Dictionary of the Underworld</em> (1950). Do these verbal orts need or deserve exhumation?</p>\n<p><em>AIMCRIER</em> 'an applauder of archers.' <em>OED</em> cites only two passages (1622, 1638) from (coincidentally) Francis and Gervase Markham. It's now the American Toastmaster's Club self-definition; also a common dog name on American Kennel Club websites.</p>\n<p><em>BEDSWERVER</em> 'one that is false to the bed'—Johnson's <em>Dictionary</em>, citing Shakespeare's <em>Winter's Tale</em> (2. 1. 93), the only <em>OED</em> citation. Now taken as one post-punk band's logo, it would suit many a film/rock star or politician.</p>\n<p><em>BELLIBONE</em> 'A woman excelling both in beauty and goodness'—Johnson, citing Spenser's <em>Pastorals</em> (1579); <em>OED</em> adds a 1586 example from Webbe's <em>Discussion of English Poetrie.</em> Johnson subjoins, “a word now out of use:” is he implying there were no such paragons in his day? See <em><a href=\"http://www.alexa.com\">www.alexa.com</a></em> for 172 entries, including American clown Shirley 'Bellibone' Sutton and Bellibone Wines. <em>OED</em> hesitantly suggests derivation from French <em>belle et bonne.</em> Latin <em>bella et bona</em> would be as plausible; cf. my VERBATIM XXX/1 column for Aubrey's cognate <em>bona roba.</em></p>\n<p>BELLYTIMBER 'materials to support the belly' —Johnson; similarly in Grose's <em>Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue.</em> 'Still in dialect use (serious) but since Butler tending to be ludicrous'—<em>OED</em>, with examples 1607–1855, the last in a Glossary of Yorkshire argot. One Internet source wrongly calls it 'lumberjack food'—Well (homage to Monty Python), I'm not a lumberjack so I don't care ...</p>\n<p><em>CHANT-PLEURE</em> 'simultaneous singing and weeping.' One Internet site wrongly defines it as French-Canadian. It belongs to Chaucer and his age; <em>OED</em> has a lone 1714 addition. An anonymous Internet sonnet, <em>Clutch Your Purse,</em> begins “Those fucking gypsies: chantpleure ...”</p>\n<p><em>FELLOWFEEL</em> 'to empathise.' Not before the 17th century, plus a lone 1708 use. It would suit gooey modern Touchy Feely/Here For You.</p>\n<p><em>FLESH-SPADES</em> 'fingernails.' Apparently unique to <em>Tom Jones</em>, book 11, chapter 8.</p>\n<p><em>KEAK</em> 'to cackle.' <em>OED</em> exemplifies 1545–1878, mainly earlier; the latest text associates it with Cumberland. Internet references are dominated by the rap 'artist', Keak da Sneak, not a revival I cherish.</p>\n<p><em>LIP-CLAP</em> Allegedly 17th-century for 'kiss.' <em>OED</em>'s lone 1606 entry reads <em>lip-clip</em> or <em>lap-clap.</em> Is there modern confusion with the clap? Cf. Julie Coleman, <em>Love, Sex &amp; Marriage: A Historical Thesaurus</em> (1998), p. 75.</p>\n<p><em>LUBBERWORT</em> 'junk food.' <em>Book of Lists</em> gives no dates. <em>OED</em> cites only two 16th-century passages, from which period come <em>lubber</em> and <em>lubberland</em>, mythical herb and paradise for the idle. Johnson, quoting Congreve, defines <em>lubber</em> as 'A sturdy drone: an idle fat bulky losel.' Sounds like something from our board game Balderdash.</p>\n<p><em>MERRY-GO-SORRY</em> 'combination of good/bad news.' Confined to a handful of 17th-century texts, this has regained titular modern currency for memoirs, short stories, and songs—Google for details.</p>\n<p><em>MURFLES</em> 'freckles.' No date given, perhaps unsurprisingly, since it is not in <em>OED—</em> Step forward, fellow-VERBATIMites ...</p>\n<p><em>SMELLSMOCK</em> 'Lecher.' Common 16th/17th-century appellation. Revived in W. F. Smith's Cambridge translation (1893) of <em>Rabelais</em>, on show in W. Sespry's <em>Wordsworth Rhyming Dictionary</em> (2005), p. 24. Also a 19th-Century dialect plant term.</p>\n<p><em>SNIRTLE</em> 'to snicker.' Sounds like a Goon Show word, but (OED) unique to Robbie Burns (“He feigned to snirtle in his sleeve”) and other Scottish dialecticians—so we don't get off Scot-free.</p>\n<p><em>WURP</em> 'stone's throw; glance of the eye.' Very early and rare, three <em>OED</em> examples 950-1275, earliest from the Lindisfarne Gospels, translating Luke 22. 41 (“A stone's cast”—<em>King James Bible</em>). The Internet's <em><a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com\">www.urbandictionary.com</a></em> professes to show, with a cornucopia of examples, that WURP is now “A word for all conversations,” deriving it from an Oxfordshire toponym—should I rename my column <em>As The Wurp Turns?</em></p>",
