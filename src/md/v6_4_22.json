Apparently he\nmade having fun with his essay a stronger objective than\ndeveloping a totally accurate argument, for he indulges in\nunbecoming techniques to achieve his ends.  He fails entirely\nto see that a reference book must be judged in terms of its\nutility, finds delight in the frequently fallacious ploy of\ncriticizing a critique by criticizing the critic, confuses (in his\nlast paragraph) the vast difference between an etymology\nand a definition (whether gloss or explanation), and because\nof this confusion commits the almost unforgivable sin of cutting\na quotation and ignoring its context so as to obscure its\noriginal point.  Above all, overlooking my first sentence, he\nmaneuvers (like Shaw's Bannal) by making an appeal to the\nauthority of Dr. Stearn (which I should be the last to deny),\nfails to note that even authorities sometimes goof, and therefore\nfails to meet my intended point: that St. Martin's is to\nbe faulted for issuing, without revision for a vastly different\naudience, a book for <em>British</em> gardeners.  American gardeners,\nby and large, are still unused to naming in botanical terms,\nand a book released for them should not only list American\nspecies but also, to be truly useful, must be more thorough\nin its common-to-botanical section.  The Stearn book was\nwritten, not for professionals like horticulturists, botanists,\nor learned editors, but for gardeners.  My thesis still holds: it\nis not truly helpful to <em>American gardeners</em>.</p>",
