<p>Mr. Koplow's remarks [IX, 4] on <em>analog</em> and <em>digital</em> are a
little misleading.  An analog computer is one that represents
quantities by physical analogs for example, the number 5
could be represented by 5 volts or 5 degrees of rotation and
performs computations upon them by physical manipulation of
the analogs.  A nonlogarithmic slide rule is a simple analog
computer that represents quantities by length, and can add two
numbers by adding the two lengths to get the analog of their
product.  (Normal slide rules, of course, represent logarithms of
quantities and multiply the quantities by adding the lengths,
but the principle is the same.)  On the other hand, a digital
computer represents a quantity as a set of symbols (in effect,
digits) and performs computations upon them by means of
symbol-manipulating procedures.  The physical realization of
the symbols, electronically or otherwise, is irrelevant to the
procedures themselves.</p>
<p>Likewise, an analog watch represents time with an analog,
namely the rotation of its hands; a digital watch uses symbols.
As digital stereo systems start to become common, we may see
nondigital records referred to, quite correctly, as <em>analog
records</em>: the groove of the record is an analog of the sound
wave that is recorded.</p>
<p>A small note about Mr. Urdang's article is the same issue
on word processing and computers: Stupidity and illiteracy are
as rife in the computer world as anywhere else.  Be assured that
many computer professionals are concerned about raising
standards.  At Brown, courses in writing are required of all
students majoring in Computer Science; it's not a perfect
solution, but it helps.</p>
