Considering the increasing number of\nspelling pronunciations one encounters these days, that\nis not surprising: afflúent, instead of affluent, probably\nbecause the traditional stress pattern makes the\nword sound like <em>effluent</em>.  (This was not a confusing\nproblem in the past, because fewer people then talked\nabout ecology and <em>effuents</em> than today.)  Other\nchanges, some from Britain, seem to be born of sheer\nperversity: controversy, regulátory, disciplińary, etc.\nAt best, determining the pronunciation of an English\nword can often be a pain in the neck for the casual\ndictionary user: interpretation of the key to the respelling\nsystem, usually repeated at the bottom of\nevery other page, requires some effort, and even then,\nwith variants given, users are often confused: if two or\nmore pronunciations are shown, are they equally appropriate\nin the user's dialect area or is the first “preferred”\nby 80 percent of the speakers and the other (or\nothers) used by the rest?  Are the variants shown distributed\ngeographically?  If so, how?  The information\nprovided in general dictionaries about pronunciation is\nvery sketchy and, for the layman, hard to understand.\n(Most laymen misunderstand the term <em>preferred</em>, taking\nit to mean “preferred by the experts,” rather than\n'preferred by the majority of users of English'—or,\nmore accurately, 'preferred by the majority of users\n<em>according to the information at hand</em>.'  In many cases,\nfor instance, where <em>preferred</em> may refer to the ordering\nof definitions, the data for huge numbers of the senses\nlisted in a dictionary is very sparse.)</p>\n<p>Although the stated purpose of this book in no\nway suggests that general dictionaries or laymen were\neven remotely considered in its compilation, it is a\ndisappointment that they were not, for it would not\nhave required much more space to have examined and\nreported on the phonetic representations of sounds in\nthe major dictionaries.  After all, the body of people\naffected by such words is far, far greater than the\nreadership to which this book will appeal.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the disappointment, for it is the\nfunction of a reviewer to comment on the book at\nhand, not the one he wishes had been written, this is\nan extremely good treatment and discussion of the\nsymbols of the systems used by linguists, phonologists,\nphoneticians, and others who work in those areas professionally.\nThe sources analyzed include IPA (International\nPhonetic Alphabet), which is widely used outside\nof the United States, and various other\ntranscription systems devised by linguists, chiefly those\nused by Chomsky and Halle in <em>The Sound Pattern of\nEnglish</em>, by Trager and Smith, by Gleason, etc., which\ngenerally represent a modification of IPA.  Because no\ngeneral or bilingual dictionaries, American or British,\nare represented, many of the special symbols developed\nby phoneticians working with lexicographers to\nproduce the relatively broad transcriptions shown\nin dictionaries—hence familiar to most of us—are\nnot here.</p>\n<p>Each symbol is shown clearly, as far as is practicable\nin alphabetical order, with a brief discussion of its\napplication.  Diacritics are also covered; there is a glossary\nof relevant terms and several pages of charts and\ndiagrams showing the vowels and consonants in the\nsystems covered.  A comprehensive, useful bibliography\nis included: for anyone interested in phonetics, the\nbibliography alone provides an excellent, if somewhat\nspecialized reading list.</p>\n<p>In all, this is a unique and valuable book for linguists\nand phoneticians, as well as for lexicographers\nand other professionals who work with transcriptions\nof spoken language.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
