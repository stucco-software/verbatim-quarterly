Faced with a <em>Bodley-Tickell,</em> either careful practice\nwith the stresses on the first and last syllables, or a\nprivate pre-emptive venting of the supporter-alienating slip “Bodily-Tickle” may be in order.</p>\n<p>Rehearsal is also advisable when dealing with\nall-female households sharing surnames like <em>Slagg,\nBastard,</em> and worse. Speech gremlins delight in subverting innocent enquiries in the hope of producing unfortunate utterances such as “Which of\nthe three Hoares am I speaking to?”\nHowever, even the most off-script of responses\nat least proceeds from a human being, which gives\nthe quick-tongued a chance to establish an informative dialogue. This is hardly possible with the\nanswering machines the caller constantly triggers,\nand occasionally can start talking to before realisation comes. Various of the commercial ones\nbecome familiar opponents, acquiring pseudo-personalities and labels like “the plummy-voiced git”\nor “the cooing Canadian.”</p>\n<p>Whatever the electoral results, it left one canvasser marvelling at the variety of regional and social accents still found among the middle-aged\nand above, from velvety local burrs to the distinctive Scots, Midlands and Geordie of incomers, or the cut-glass-and-whiplash of Hauteur Heights. At\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century they are\nalive and well and living in the West Country, wi'\nBill Brewer, Dick Turpin, Aaron Ettles, Mandy\nHempseed, Will'm Shakespeare, Francis Drake,\nOld Fruity Tone Robot and all.</p>\n<p><em>[Jerome Betts has taught EFL in Torquay and\nTotnes for the past thirty years.]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
