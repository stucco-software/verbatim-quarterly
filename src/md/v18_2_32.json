The group seems also to contain\ntwo similar sub-groups that produce opposite effects:\nthose that diminish size and express endearment\nor amusement and those that diminish stature\nor worth and express disapproval or contempt.\nAmong the first group are many children's words—\n<em>Georgy-Porgy, Henny-Penny, Turkey-Lurkey, kitchy-kitchy,\nlippity-lippity, piggly-wiggly</em>.  Among the second\nare <em>fuddy-duddy, funny-money, hoity-toity,\nhokey-pokey, namby-pamby, shilly-shally, silly-billy,\nticky-tacky, wishy-washy</em>, and the double cited\nabove, <em>willy-nilly</em>.  The power gained through rhyme\nand rhythm seems to be directed by the diminutive\nsuffix toward favorable or unfavorable meanings.</p>\n<p>During the Watergate scandal President Nixon\nhad to face an even more powerful combination, one\nthat incorporated his own nickname in a double that\nended with the negative diminutive -<em>y</em>.  Whoever\ncoined the term <em>tricky-dicky</em> must have sensed that\nthe combination would hit hard.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the two Bush administration officials, or\ntheir writers, were aware of objections to the positions\nattributed to them and decided to take the initiative,\nThornburgh by distancing himself from those\nfavoring a 'willy-nilly' commitment of troops in\nLatin America and Cheney by blaming members of\nCongress for urging 'willy-nilly' proposals to cut the\ndefense budget.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
