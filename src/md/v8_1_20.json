In a letter [February 13],\nNicholas Baker of Louisville, Kentucky, called that classification\ninto question, suggesting that the origin of <em>ack-ack</em>\nis German <em>acht acht</em> '8.8,' from the designation for\nthe weapon by its bore diameter in centimeters.  The\nAmericans, who use millimeters in such designations,\ndubbed it 'eighty-eight.'  The <em>OED</em> lists the earliest\ncitation for <em>ack-ack</em> as a 1939 issue of <em>Collier's</em> magazine,\nwhich gives the source as a British abbreviation for\n<em>Aircraft Attack,</em> employing the British name for the\nletter A (which appears also in the older <em>ack-emma</em> for\n'a.m.').</p>\n<p>We requested further corroboration of his evidence\nfrom Mr. Baker, and he has been kind enough to send\nus an affidavit from Eugene Oldach, born in Poland,\nwho served in the German army from February 1942 till\nhis capture by Americans in 1945.  Mr. Oldach's statement\nreads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... Throughout my service in the German army,\nthe 8.8-centimeter gun was called “acht acht.”\nThis was common usage.  I do not know if there\nis any connection between this and the British\nterm <em>ack-ack</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Baker calls into further evidence a listing from the\n<em>German Army Handbook 1939-1945</em> [Arco, 1974], in\nwhich the 8.8-cm gun is listed as a major weapon in\nantiaircraft artillery and, later, as the main weapon of\nthe Tiger, Jagdpanther, and Elefant tanks (Tables 1, 2,\n5).</p>\n<p>Although the resemblance between the German and\nBritish designations may be coincidental, it appears\nfrom this incontrovertible evidence that the German\nsource cannot be ignored and must, at least, be considered\nas an alternative to the British.</p>\n<p>In connection with <em>ack-ack,</em> one encounters much\n<em>flak,</em> and Mr. Baker suggests that its origin is an acronym\nof <em>Flugzeugabwehrkanone</em>.  There is a question of\nwhether that or <em>Fliegerabwehrkanone</em> is the correct\nsource.  Mr. Oldach comments:</p>\n<p>I am familiar with the terms <em>Fliegerabwehrkanone</em>\nand <em>Flugzeugabwehrkanone,</em> and they mean the\nsame and are interchangeable.</p>\n<p>Dictionaries that list one or the other would, in the\nfuture, be well advised to list both as possible sources.</p>",
