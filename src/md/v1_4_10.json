Roast\nbeef with <em>au jus</em> (literally, 'with with juice') is offered by\nmany restaurants these days, but the ultimate was attained\nby a waitress in a local steak house who asked a friend of\nmine if he wanted his prime rib <em>with au jus sauce</em> ('with\nwith juice sauce').  My favorite, however, is the California\ntourist attraction, the <em>La Brea tar pits</em> ('the the tar tar\npits').  Anglo-Saxon/Norman French couplings like <em>without\nlet or hindrance</em> do not count.</p>\n<p><em>Arnold M. Zwicky, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
