As each year of <em>N &amp; Q</em> is contained in two large octavo volumes of some 500 pages (excluding the Index) set in eight-point type (with reviews of books and periodicals in six-point), readers will appreciate that it takes a while to read through several years' worth of material and will be patient as the volumes are mined for their gems of informative, occasionally entertaining matter. On the grounds that much of what we have to say today has been said (or written)—often better—before, it is hoped that the following will prove interesting and useful to those who do not have ready access to those early volumes (or the time to read them).
