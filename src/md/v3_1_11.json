Morgan\nNew York</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">New York</span></em></p>\n<p>Everyone knows that George Washington's wife was named Martha--many people know that her maiden name was Dandridge and her married name, after her first marriage, was Custis.  But not many people are aware that George didn't call his wife Martha.  He called her Patsy.</p>\n<p>Furthermore Martha Dandridge Custis had a daughter whose name was also Martha.  Now here was a good chance to distinguish between the two Marthas at home, but by stubborn custom the daughter was also known as Patsy.</p>\n<p>First of all, to substantiate the nickname or pet name by which the Father of his Country called his wife, here is a quotation from a letter he wrote to inform his wife that he had just been called to the highest post in the American Revolutionary Army:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“My Dearest:...<br>\n“You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when I assure you, in the most solemn manner, that so far from seeking this appointment, I have used every endeavor in my power to avoid it....”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the letter ends:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“...and to assure you that I am, with the most unfeigned regard, my dear Patsy,<br>\nYour affectionate<br>\nGeorge Washington.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[<em>Ladies of the White House</em>, Laura C. Holloway, Bradley &amp; Co., Philadelphia, 1882, pages 46-7.]</p>\n<p>And how did this all come about?  Well actually in the 18th and 19th centuries the name Martha, which was quite popular, gave rise to the nickname Matty, then Patty, then Patsy.  These nicknames are reminiscent of the nicknames for Margaret: Meg, Peg and Peggy.  However, although Peg and Peggy are still recognizably derived from Margaret, Patty and Patsy no longer are recognizable as being related to Martha.</p>\n<p>The reason, of course, is the rise in popularity of the name Patricia, to which these nicknames are now closely attached.  (Witness Pat Nixon and Patty Hearst.)</p>\n<p>The interesting and rather touching letter to “Patsy” Washington was dated Philadelphia, 18th June, 1775.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
