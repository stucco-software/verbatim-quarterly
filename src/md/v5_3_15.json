Even if the phrase is much older, your “distinct impression”\nof its U.S. origin is hardly proof.

As for “Polly put the kettle on,” the nursery rhyme is\nstill current, but the catch phrase is surely obsolescent or even\nobsolete.  Having lived in England for 34 years (until last\nyear) I have <em>never</em> heard “I'll be Polly,” and as the father of a\ndaughter called Polly I think I should have noticed it.  Either\nyou know some odd Britons, or you are mis-remembering the\ncommon “I'll be mother,” omitted by Partridge but said\nwhen pouring tea.</p>\n<p>It must be hard to write such a book as this without appearing\nidiosyncratic and eclectic, and even the friendliest reviewers\nhave complained about omissions that seemed important\nto them.  No doubt Partridge will take account of this and\nof any correspondence if and when he prepares a second edition.\nThe fact remains that the apparently immortal author\nof the undeniably immortal <em>Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional\nEnglish</em> continues to delight his readers.  He tries\nvery hard not to be parochial (is it fair to ask that a book written\nin Britain should label “Briticisms” as well as Americanisms?\nwould you expect an American author to label Americanisms?)\nand if he sometimes fails to be omniscient, let us\nhope that American (and other) readers will be tempted to\nhelp.</p>\n<p><em>[Richard Condon, Rixensart, Belgium]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
