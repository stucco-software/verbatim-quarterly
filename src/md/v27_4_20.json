I found Dean Juniper's article “180 Degree Homonyms” especially interesting. Curiously, Mr. Juniper expressed puzzlement over what he regards to be a new meaning of the word <em>sanction</em>—to penalize. While I have not checked the <em>OED,</em> I suspect that both meanings—'to permit' as well as 'to punish' an action—have a long history in our language because both are already present in the Latin verbal parent (<em>sancio</em>.) Cicero, for example, used the verb both ways—<em>Sanxerunt autem alia legibus</em> Rep. 1, 2, 2 'they sanctioned (i.e. permitted) other things with laws' and S<em>olon capite sanxit</em> Att. 10, 1, 2 'Solon sanctioned [the matter] with the death penalty.'</p>\n<p><em>[Allan Mahnke, Minneapolis, MN]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
