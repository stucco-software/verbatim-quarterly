We\nmay have first tasted the thrill of victory in debate after\naggressively challenging a questionable word in such a game—\nor resisting an aggressive challenger's attack.  Eventually, players\nfound they needed an objective authority to settle disputes.\nA dictionary was agreed upon, and if the word was an entry—\nvoilá!  If not, Ah <em>hah!</em> Simple enough.</p>\n<p>But apparently not simple enough for Tom Pulliam and\nGorton Carruth, who have compiled <em>The Complete Word Game\nDictionary</em> to “[settle] challenges almost instantly.”  Were it not\nfor their credentials (Pulliam is a frequent <em>Word Ways</em> contributer\nand Carruth a former Funk and Wagnalls editor in\nchief), one might suspect them of having written a cynical ripoff,\na non-book.  The need it fills seems fabricated, the ten-page\npreface perfunctory and padded.  The remaining 645 pages are\ntwo lists.  One gives 180,000 words in root and variant forms.\nExample: PANIDROSIS PANIER PANIFICATION PANIME PANIMMUNITY\nPANINI... you get the idea.  The second list arranges\n“45,000 High-Scoring Words”—containing <em>J, Q, X</em> and <em>Z</em>—for\nScrabble players' use.</p>\n<p><em>TCWGD's</em> preface states that the book's “greatest value\nwill be for the Scrabble player, whether neophyte or tournament\ncaliber.”  Don't believe it.  Serious Scrabblers recognize\nonly one reference work: <em>The Official Scrabble® Players Dictionary</em>\n(Pocket Books, $4.95).  Tote <em>TCWGD</em> to a tournament\nand you'll get some very strange looks.  <em>OSPD</em> (as it's called) is a\nreal dictionary, providing parts of speech and definitions, while\n<em>TCWGD</em> gives neither.  This is not a quibble; players need this\ninformation to tell which inflections are possible.  For starters,\n<em>OSPD</em> lists “AA: n, pl. -s rough, cindery lava.”  <em>TCWGD</em> lists\n“AA,” leaving the user to guess whether it can take <em>-s, -ed, -ly</em>,\nor <em>-ing</em>.  Some inflected words are listed, but irregularly.  Too\noften the two books do not agree.  Among many examples,\n<em>TCWGD</em> proposes DHA, BRABANT, and SLIRT, all <em>verboten</em> at\nScrabble tournaments, while ignoring the usable ZAIRE,\nCARICES, and FOWLPOX.</p>\n<p>Finally, Pulliam and Carruth have included too many\nlonger—hence rarely usable—words.  Boggle, Perquackey, Scrabble,\nand Probe players would be ill-advised to study the tens of\nthousands of 9-or-more-letter words: when would they use\nthem?</p>\n<p><em>The Complete Word Game Dictionary</em> will help neither\nbeginning nor advanced word game players.  As such players\nwill recognize this immediately on seeing the book, it remains\nnecessary only to warn their gift-giving friends and relatives.</p>\n<p><em>Barry Tunick</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
