Evans treats the\nproblem well in his <em>Dictionary of Contemporary American\nUsage</em> (1957).  But this discussion is really supererogatory, as\n“correct speech and writing” may be seen as expressing a\nsingle idea.</p>\n<p>Third, although I might better have used the subjunctive\n<em>could</em> instead of the indicative <em>can</em> in the sentence Mrs.\nFeinsilver cites, she wrongly asserts that I misused <em>can for may</em>\nhere: “But one who espies these linguistic peccadilloes should\nnot gloat over the discovery, nor can one really use such lapses\nto discredit exemplary writers....” This statement involves\nobjective facts about one's limitations in discrediting another\nrather than what is permissible; thus <em>can</em> is correct.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Feinsilver is quite right to attempt to point out\nshortcomings in the prose of stylistic exemplars.  (One might\nwish, however, that her batting average were better than .500!)\nStill, if she is truly interested in combatting “the decline of\nstandards,” as all aficionados of language should be, she should\nrecognize the worth of Simon's writings in behalf of that cause.\nAnd she should avoid writing, “the decline of standards as\nexemplified by two books which should have been unrepresentative\nof that process...” where <em>which</em> should be <em>that</em>.  And she\nshould refrain from using spurious <em>Timese</em> titles such as “Man-of-letters\nKingsley Amis” [VII, 4].</p>\n<p>These tu quoques serve only to demonstrate what should\nneed no demonstration: the fallibility of even the most careful\nwriters.  Doubtless one might quibble with usages in this very\nletter (the less-than-airtight <em>thus for therefore</em>, for example).  To\nbe sure, we must continue to fight the battle for excellence, but\nwe must also sometimes question whether we've chosen the\nright battlefield.</p>\n<p><em>[Bryan A.
