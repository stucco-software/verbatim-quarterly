We now also have a bulletin board where VERBATIM readers can post messages and hold discussions, and where the editor may pop in from time to time to answer pressing questions such as what three words end in <em>-gry</em> (just kidding; the question's a hoax.) Wear your heart on your sleeve, or better yet emblazoned across your chest, with our new VERBATIM t-shirts, as you drink from a VERBATIM mug while merrily clicking away across a VERBATIM mousepad. (These are at <em><a href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/VERBATIMmag\">http://www.cafepress.com/VERBATIMmag</a>.)</em></p>",
