I have always read such lines as if\nthey were followed by a <em>Wow!</em>, <em>Colly Gee!</em>, or <em>Think of\nThat!</em> On page 2 appears the “Amazing Slicer Does It\nAll-with 3 STAINLESS STEEL Blades and SAFETY HOLDER!”\n(<em>Wow!</em>) Then, “the Vanderbilt Jewel-Rivals the brilliance\nof genuine diamonds!” (<em>Colly!</em>) It is interesting/useful\nto note that the tiny type under the illustration reveals\n“... carats refer to size not weight.” That's a bit odd, as\nany dictionary definition of carat will show. “NEVER BUY\nSOCKS AGAIN!” is the headline of an offering of “Incredible\nSuper Nylon Socks.” I'm not sure I don't want to buy socks\nagain: wearing the same socks 10, 15, or 25 years from now\nmight be quite boring. (Now, “Never wash socks again”\nmight be more tempting.) Here are some more Gee-whiz\nclinchers from the same catalogue:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WAIST REDUCER BELT SLIM DOWN Waist and Hip Area<br>\nWITHOUT STRENUOUS EXERCISE! ... PERFECT FOR<br>\nMEN AND WOMEN!</p>\n<p>Grind Everything From Meat To Nuts! Suction-Grip<br>\nVACUUM BASE Stays Put!</p>\n<p>... Automatic Screwdriver and Push Drill YOU PUSH<br>\n... IT TURNS AUTOMATICALLY!</p>\n<p>Get “ZIP UP” Protection For all your valuables! (This\nis a man's pocket wallet with some plastic credit\ncard sleeves: it affords little protection from someone\nwho steals the entire thing.)</p>\n<p>Never Clean Toilets Again! (Does this mean you'll\nnever have to clean them again or that they'll\nnever be clean again?)</p>\n<p>Have everything you'll need with our COMPLETE 20\nPiece Kitchen Towel Set! (This may be an over-statement\nfor some people. Man does not live by\nkitchen towel sets alone.)</p>\n<p>Deluxe DINING TABLE...Recessed holder for glass\nor cup! (From the scale of the picture, this would\nseem to be about 8\" × 16\" with four 16\" legs. “To\nstore, simply slide legs underneath.” That, to some,\nmay constitute a “Deluxe DINING TABLE,” but in\nthe Affluent Society of the 1980s it might seem a\ntrifle overstated.)</p>\n<p>Fill Your Boom with a rainbow of MOVING LIGHTS!\n...You'll be reminded of the era of marathon\ndances as you enjoy the exciting movement of color\nand light!</p>\n<p>INSTANT PERSONAL MASSAGE...Anywhere, Anytime!\n[Cordless, personal vibrator] slips into purse or\nbriefcase for on-the-spot relief anywhere!</p>\n<p>NEVER IRON AGAIN!</p>\n<p>Have A “Hardware Store” IN YOUR OWN HOME!\n(Must I?)</p>\n<p>NEVER WAX YOUR CAR AGAIN! (N.B.: This doesn't say\nyou won't have to wax your car again, only that\nyou should use this “New Miracle Polymer Sealant”\ninstead of wax.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lest anyone think that the people who run this outfit\nare maladroit nincompoops when it comes to language, note\nthat the see-through panel in the mailing envelope showed\nthe following: “One of the persons listed below has won\n$50,000.00 . . . M. Arvay, Toledo, OH.; L. Urdang, Essex,\nCT.; L. Gloyd, Ft. Lee, VA.” A careful reading of the\nsmall print reveals that “Ms. Marjorie Arvay of Toledo\n[was] the 1980 Giant Jackpot winner!” And you probably\nthought that the first line meant that Arvay, Urdang, or\nGloyd had already been selected to win a prize that was yet\nto be claimed. A check with information revealed that there\nis, indeed, an Arvay in Toledo (with an unlisted number);\nbut a similar check could not turn up anyone with the\nnamed L. Gloyd in Ft. Lee, VA. That, of course, may\nmean only that L. Gloyd doesn't have a phone; perhaps he\n(or she) ordered a “COMPLETE 20 Piece Kitchen Towel Setl”\nand has everything he (or she) will need.  [L.U.]</p>",
