In the following\nparagraphs, the year of first recorded use given in\nthe <em>OED</em> is indicated in parentheses.</p>\n<p><em>Grind</em> (1000) early attained its modern definition,\nto 'rub against or to work into,' but by 1400 its\nanatomical meaning—a 'lower abdominal quadrant'—had\ngiven way to <em>groin</em>, our modern usage.\nNot until 1625 was <em>groin</em> identified as the seat of lust\n(1000).  <em>Grine</em> (1400) was then a 'noose, halter, or\nsnare,' as well as an obsolete form of <em>grin</em>, perhaps a\npre-Columbian leer, and of <em>grine</em> as <em>groin</em>, a use still\nprevalent in Appalachia.</p>\n<p>While <em>bumps</em> (1592) as 'gestures of concupiscence'\n(1340) are now automatically associated with\ngrinds, our ancestors used many words to describe\n<em>lumps</em> (1475) in the skin.  <em>Wen</em> (1000), <em>boil</em> (1000),\nand <em>kernels</em> (1000) as currently in “kernels in my\ngrine,” are the oldest, but <em>pimple</em> (1400), <em>rising</em>\n(1563), <em>bealing</em> (1605), and <em>gland</em> (1692) are also\nstill used to designate small nonvenereal masses.  Cutaneous\nmanifestations of venereal disease have\nbeen variously identified, early as <em>bubo</em> (1398), a\n'swelling in the groin or axilla.'  Thus the form of\nplague characterized by such regional swelling became\n<em>bubonic</em> to distinguish it from the <em>pneumonic</em>\nform.  Later <em>bubo</em> came to refer almost exclusively to\nthe inguinal swelling of venereal disease, along the\nway being corrupted to “blue balls” as in the colorful\nepithet, <em>blue-balled bastard.  Balls</em> (1352) of\ncourse stand for 'testes.'  The 'inguinal lesion of primary\nsyphilis' is usually a <em>chancre</em> (1605).  Its most\ndescriptive competitor, <em>haircut</em>, not included in the\n<em>OED</em>, occurs only in males, blamed on being cut by\nstiff female public hair.</p>\n<p>Since many venereal diseases, most frequently\n<em>gonorrhea</em> (1547), result in purulent urethral drainage,\nmany vulgar terms for this phenomenon survive.\n<em>Gonorrhea</em> itself was first a word for the discharge\nbefore it came to describe the disease when\nbacterial causation was determined.  Left on the\nstreet were such synonyms as <em>gleet</em> (1340), <em>clap</em>\n(1587), and <em>running ranes</em> or <em>raines</em> (1588).  <em>Gleet</em>\nwas originally described as a 'slimy matter' (1400),\nsticky or greasy, characteristically as 'phlegm collected\nin the stomach, especially of the hawk.'\n<em>Phlegm</em> eventually came to refer to <em>mucus</em> (1662)\nand to be <em>hawked</em> (1604) from the sinuses or lungs of\npeople with respiratory tract irritation or infection.\nJohn Ray, the great English biologist and pioneer\nlexicographer, author of <em>Collection of English Proverbs</em>\n(first edition 1670, second edition 1678) and\n<em>Collection of English Words</em> (first edition 1673, second\nedition 1691), suffered severely from an ulcerative\ndisease of his legs.  He reported in 1704 that\n“part of the skin of one of my insteps by degrees has\nturned black and now as with the flesh under it it is\nrotted and corrupted...yet runs a copious gleet.”</p>\n<p><em>Strain</em> (1588), in the sense of 'trickle,' as a painful\nor slow urination came early to refer to urethral\ninflammation.  Its precursor was the now quite obsolete\n<em>strangury</em> (1398) 'slow and painful urination.'  In\n1532 <em>strain</em> came also to imply compulsion, manifested\nin urethritis by urgency and frequency with\nscant flow.  Thus evolution of meanings assumed by\n<em>strain</em> can be easily traced.</p>\n<p>Some early words for <em>sexual intercourse</em> (1798)\nas <em>congress</em> (1589) persist although considerably\nmodified in meaning.  <em>Service</em> (1315) is another, although\nartificial insemination is inexorably driving\nthe service of cows by bulls from the lea of language.\nIt does persist in the service of Venus and perhaps in\nservice stations with their birth control centers, offering\ncondoms for coins, on a wall of their men's\nrooms.  <em>Swive</em> (1386), to <em>copulate</em> (1483) with a female,\nshares with <em>swinging</em> (1400), a sense of motion,\nthe former deriving from <em>swivel</em> (1307), a coupling\ndevice which accounts for the swivel chair.\nThe <em>OED</em> does not include <em>swivel hips</em> but many\nschool teachers were once called, out of earshot,\n“Miss Swiviel Hips” and the thought expressed, “I'd\nlike to have that swing on my porch.”  the <em>OED</em> says\nnothing about <em>swivet</em> either, but <em>in a swivet</em> has\nmeant 'hot and bothered' for generations in the\nSouth.  <em>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary</em> does recognize\n<em>in a swivet</em> but neither its age nor derivation,\nciting <em>Newsweek</em> as its source.  <em>Swing</em> (1400) 'oscillatory\nor rotatory action of the body' came by 1584 to\nimply 'freedom of action.'  Both <em>swiving</em> and <em>swinging</em>\nrequire sexual vigor and inclination, since 1541\nknown as <em>courage</em>, so that “I got no <em>courage</em>” is more\ntime-honored than “I'm <em>impotent</em>” (1615).  Some refer\nto this difficulty as “losing my <em>nature</em>” (1386),\nand <em>impotence</em> recorded in the medical history often\nundergoes technological transformation to “importance,”\nas in “he complained of importance since he\nstarted to take medicine for his pressure,” also\nknown as “the high blood.”  Within the limits of\nmarriage <em>courage</em> is necessary for a satisfactory “family\nlife.”  The <em>OED</em> is concerned about being <em>in the\nfamily way</em>, the natural consequences of a satisfactory\nfamily life, but not about the family life itself.</p>\n<p>Non-Southerners struck by our <em>quaint</em> (1369)\nspeech may fail to recognize linguistic fossils when\nthey hear them and likewise to appreciate their\nvalue as signs of the movement of peoples and the\nviability of speech through the centuries.</p>\n<p>VERBATIM makes an excellent gift, at any time of the\nyear, for mature, intelligent people interested in language.</p>",
