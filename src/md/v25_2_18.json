Hanley, Assistant Professor of English, USAF Academy</em></p>\n<p><em>Catchpenny</em> denotes a book of negligible intellectual or aesthetic worth created strictly to make money. As its earliest recorded usage would have us believe, a <em>catchpenny</em> is designed to appeal to the poorly educated or undemanding book buyer—the sort of consumer, in other words, who expects the book trade to provide not vessels of wisdom or knowledge but cheap titillation, patently implausible adventure narratives, carelessly assembled rehashes or compilations of well-known material, and so on. Glance at the titles in the fiction section of most airport bookstores and you will see the successors to the 18th-century catchpenny. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>'s earliest citation for the adjective <em>catchpenny</em> comes from a 1759 entry in the <em>Critical Review</em> by Oliver Goldsmith; the <em>OED's</em> earliest citation of the noun <em>catchpenny</em> is taken from a 1760 issue of the <em>London Magazine.</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c1\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup> In fact, both the adjectival and nominal forms of <em>catchpenny</em> were created or at least given legitimacy by contributors to the <em>Monthly Review,</em> who began employing the term as early as November 1749. In February 1750, John Ward acknowledges the popularity of the neologism when he asserts that <em>A Dissertation Upon Earthquakes</em> appears to be “one of those hasty productions commonly denominated catch-penny pieces.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-c2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-c2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>By the mid-1750s, <em>catch-penny</em> had become a term familiar to readers of the <em>Monthly Review.
