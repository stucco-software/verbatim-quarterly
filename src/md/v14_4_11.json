Whatever curiosity might\nhave been aroused at the tender age when we first\nlearned <em>Pop!  Goes the Weasel</em> was likely to have been\nsquelched (if, indeed, it ever manifested itself as a\nquestion) by mother or nanny who, herself ignorant of\nthe answer, dismissed it as a bit of nursery-rhyme nonsense:\nafter all, it took Baring Gould and the Opies to\nalert the world to the secretive, satirical undertones\nlying beneath many common nursery rhymes.  William\nGreaves, in an article on a collection of Victorian music\nhall posters [<em>The Times</em>, 10 February 1988], reports\nthat the Hackney borough archivist, David Mander,\nspeculates that the expression arose because the frequenters\nof the Eagle, a pub mentioned in the song,\nfound their finances occasionally stretched, requiring\nthem to <em>pop</em> ('pawn' in the vernacular of the day) their\n<em>weasel</em>.  As to the nature of a <em>weasel</em>, there is some\ndoubt: Mander suggests it was “some kind of carpenter's\ntool”; Len Deadfield, current landlord of the Eagle\n(rebuilt around 1900), thinks it was a tailor's flatiron;\nBill Manley, a local historian, questions the\nlikelihood that any worker would pawn the tools of his\ntrade, thus disabling his ability to get them out of\npawn.  In Manley's opinion, <em>weasel</em> means, 'any item of\nvalue, like a family watch chain.'  There are so many\nfactors at work in expressions of this kind—poetic license,\nlost sources of metaphors, etc.—that it is dangerous\nto offer definitive answers without sufficient\nsupporting evidence.  Nonetheless, one might well\nquestion the image, literal or metaphoric, of the monkey\nchasing the weasel “once around the cobbler's\nbench,” which makes little sense if the weasel is an\nobject.

To be sure, one of\nthe problems in accepting <em>pop</em> in the sense of 'pawn' is\nthat the words of the song would seem to indicate that\nthe monkey received some sort of knock or rap in retaliation\nfor “chasing the weasel”—whatever that might\nmean.  The most tempting theory combines the semantic\ncontent of senses 10, 11, and 16 of <em>monkey</em> with\n<em>weese</em>—at least those place the expression into the general\nrealm of bibulation, in keeping, if remotely, with\nthe folklore of the Eagle.</p>\n<p>Alas, all of the foregoing is too clever by half, for\nwe can find (also in the <em>OED</em>), under <em>Pop,</em> <em>int., adv</em>.,\nthe following intelligence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Pop goes the weasel</em>, name of a country dance\nvery popular in the 'fifties,' in which these words\nwere sung or exclaimed by the dancers while\none of them darted under the arms of the others\nto his partner; also the name of the tune; hence\nas a vb. and in other humorous uses.  See <em>N. &amp;\nQ</em>. (1905) 10th Ser. III. 492, IV. 209.</p>\n<p>...<em>c</em> <em>1854</em> (<em>Musicseller's Advt</em>. in <em>Newspaper</em>)\nThe new country dance 'Pop goes the weasel,'\nintroduced by her Majesty Queen Victoria.—\n<em>Musical Bouquet</em> No. 409. <em>Pop goes the Weasel;\nLa Tempête</em>; and <em>Le Grand Père.  These fashionable\ndances as performed at the court balls.  1855</em>\nin <em>N. &amp; Q</em>. 10th Ser. IV. 211/1 This dance is very\npopular, it is without deception, 'Pop goes the\nweasel' has been to Court, and met a good reception....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is not to say that <em>pop goes the weasel</em> (the\ndance and the expression) could not have originated at\nthe Grecian Saloon, the theater annex to the Eagle in\nCity Road; but the embellishing information puts us\nno closer to the etymology.  Is it possible that what is\ndescribed is a popping sound made when tapping a\nkeg with a bung-starter in order to <em>suck the monkey</em>?\nPerhaps.  But that still does not explain the words of the\njingle.  Clearly, what we need is some attestation for\n<em>weasel</em> (or a similar word) having the meaning 'bung,'\n'barrel' or 'keg,' or the like.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
