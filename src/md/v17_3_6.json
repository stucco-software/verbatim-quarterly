The principal figure\nin this development was Dr. 'Arris Toddle, who\ninvented the Syllogism in Barbara, as well as those in\nBetsy, Patricia, and Harriet.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">2</a></sup> This form of reasoning\nruns essentially as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All men are mortal.<br>\nSocrates was a man.<br>\n∴ Socrates was mortal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, since Socrates was mortal, he must have\ndied by now, so he is no longer alive and thus is no\nlonger a man.  It follows that he is now no longer\nmortal and thus will live forever.  This establishes\nthe immortality of the sole, as well as that of the\nheel, calf, ankle, and toe.  A similar argument can be\ncarried out for anyone at all, except, of course, for\nBarbara herself, who was not a man to begin with.</p>\n<p>A refinement of this form of argument, worked\nout by Dr. Ross C. Knee, is the Barbara of Seville,\nwhich underlies much of the Seville Rites legislation\nof the 1960's.  These important practices grew out\nof a popular mass movement composed by King\nMartin Luther, the only man ever to be awarded\nninety-five masters degrees, after writing as many\ntheses<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup>, and were inspired by the Seville Shepherds,\nwho were led by Seville herself, a woman with six\nhundred ninety-three distinct personalities, all but\nat most a very few of which were entirely unaware\nof the existence of most but not nearly all of the\nremaining others.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a4\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">4</a></sup> As in the case of Barbara, Seville's\nreasoning can also be stated in the form of a\nsyllogism:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All men are mortal.<br>\nAt least two hundred ninety-five of Sevilles' distinct\npersonalities are men.<br>\n∴ Seville is suffering from a severe identity crisis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, since the men are mortal, the proportion\nof Seville that comprises them will gradually decrease,\nleading to here ventual recovery, just in time\nto die from other causes.  This leaves Socrates the\nsole survivor, again establishing the immortality of\nthe sole.</p>\n<p>The next great development in logic was carried\nout by the Muddyville School, also known as The\nSkull Ass-ticks, when they played rock music on the\nside to make a living.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a5\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">5</a></sup>\nThese logicians specialized in\nthe counting of angels, which they found more effective\nthan sheep in anesthetizing their students.  It is\nto these great minds that we owe the Fundamental\nTheorem of Formal Logic, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fundamental Theorem of Formal Logic:</p>\n<p>(a)  Exactly 2973 angels can dance on the head\nof a pin.</p>\n<p>(b)  Exactly 3874 angels can dance on the head\nof a needle.</p>\n<p>(c)  Exactly 264 angels can dance on the head\nof a two-penny nail.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since angels tend to be of uncertain gender, neither\nBarbara nor Seville will have anything to do\nwith them, so their status vis-à-vis mortality remains\nan open question.  This is, in fact, the most important\nunresolved issue in all of formal logic, because of\ngreatly inflated land values and a rapidly increasing\nangel population, both of which place dancing space\nat a premium.</p>\n<p>Logic lay dormant for many centuries after being\nworked over so brilliantly by The Skull Ass-ticks,\nbut it was finally rescued from angelic oblivion by\nHerr Professor Gottlob der Friggin', who proved\nthat the morning star is not the same as the evening\nstar, even though both are Venus.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a6\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a6\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">6</a></sup> This invalidated\nthe previously unquestioned Principle of the Substitutability\nof Identicals, which had been formulated\nby Leibniz in his battle with Figby Newton for recognition\nas the original discoverer of the infinitesimal\ncalculus.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a7\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a7\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">7</a></sup> This principle can be formulated as a\nsyllogism, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Leibniz discovered the calculus.</p>\n<p>Newton is not Leibniz.</p>\n<p>∴ Newton did not discover the calculus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, Gottlob's figgin' work showed that this argument\nwas invalid, since Leibniz worked in the\nmorning, Newton worked in the evening, and it was\nreally Galileo that discovered the calculus while\nlooking at Jupiter, not Venus, through his telescope.\nGalileo also disproved the principle that heavier objects\nfall faster than lighter ones, by dropping an apple\nand a watermelon off the top of a tower.  It was\nthis apple that gave Newton the idea of Universal\nGravitation, when it landed conveniently on his\nhead, and it was Universal Gravitation that suggested\nto Newton the concepts of the infinitesimal\ncalculus.  Exactly the same thing happened to\nLeibniz, except that he got hit by the watermelon\nand so was unconscious for several hours.  This gave\nNewton time to get to the patent office and file his\nclaim for calculus, before Leibniz could figure out\nwhat had happened.</p>\n<p>Gottlob's discoveries laid the foundation for a\ntremendous spurt of work in formal logic from the\nbeginning of this century to the present day.  First,\nRussell N. Whitehead managed to derive all known\nmathematics from logical principles, in contrast to\nprevious mathematicians, who had derived it from\nillogical principles.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a8\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a8\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">8</a></sup>  This led to the famous Gödel\ntheorem, which says that all mathematics cannot be\nderived from logical principles.  Gödel proved this\ntheorem by showing that every sentence in a logical\nlanguage can be encoded as a statement about positive\nnumbers.  Since English is not a logical language,\nit follows that sentences in English can be\nencoded only in non-positive numbers and thus that\nEnglish can make only negative statements about\nmathematics.  Since the same is true of every natural\nlanguage, it follows that mathematics makes no\nsense whatsoever and thus that it can be ignored\nfor all practical purposes.  This led Al Tarski to the\ndiscovery that logic itself depends only on the\nweather,<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a9\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a9\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">9</a></sup> as indicated in the following syllogism:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Snow is white.</p>\n<p>Snow is white.</p>\n<p>∴ Snow is white.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since “snow is white” is true if and only if snow is\nwhite, and since “snow is white” is true if\nand only if “snow is white” is true, it follows that\n“ ' “snow is white” is true' is true” is true if and only\nif “ 'snow is white' is true” is true.  These discoveries\nresulted in the theory of models, the clothing worn\nby whom gradually shrank to zero, thereby enabling\nAbe Robinson to prove the existence of infinitesimals,\nwith predictable consequences in the physiognomy\nof certain members of the audience.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a10\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a10\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">10</a></sup> This reestablished\nthe intersubstitutability of Newton and\nLeibniz, as long as it not snowing and Venus is still\nvisible.</p>\n<p>The most recent and, in many ways, the most\nexciting development in formal logic is the new field\nof fuzzy logic, in which precision is replaced with\nvagueness and truth with maybe and perhaps.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a11\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a11\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">11</a></sup> This\nwas invented by Lofty Zappa, who is also known,\nfrankly, as the father of invention, because of his\nwork on the logic of necessity.  Rather than taking\nstatements to be either true or false, fuzzy logic assumes\nthat statements are true or false to some\ndegree, so the Syllogism in Barbara, for example,\nwould be reformulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Socrates was more or less a man.</p>\n<p>Most men are usually mortal.</p>\n<p>∴ Socrates was most likely mortal to degree\n.86539.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the average lifespan in ancient Athens was\n51.86 years, it follows that Socrates would have\nlived until he was 44.8791254 years old, if he had\nnot developed a taste for hemlock.  Unfortunately,\nhis addiction to this controlled substance led eventually\nto his arrest on charges of drug abuse, thereby\nenabling Play-dough to counterfeit all of his ideas.  It\nwas in critiquing Play-dough that Toddle developed\nthe Syllogism in Barbara,<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a12\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a12\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">12</a></sup> but this was where we\nstarted.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2></h2>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-a1\">\n<p>Preparation of this essay was supported, in part, by a grant from\nthe International Society for Skeptical Humorism.
