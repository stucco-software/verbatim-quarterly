<p>Francis Grose, antiquary and artist, was born in Greenford,
Middlesex, in the early 1730s.  His father, an immigrant
from Switzerland, was a successful jeweler, and was responsible
for the crown of George III.  Young Francis received a sound
classical education, but instead of university went to Shipley's
drawing school, and became a moderately successful artist.  He
was adjutant and paymaster, and later captain, in the Hampshire
militia, but, to judge from the prodigal way he ran
through his father's fortune, one wonders about the state of the
regimental finances.  He himself declared that his only account
books were his pockets.  He paid into the right and out from the
left.</p>
<p>In his day he was probably best known for his <em>Antiquities
of England and Wales</em>, which he illustrated.  It was while
collecting for his <em>Antiquities of Scotland</em> that he ran into
Robert Burns, who wrote “On Captain Francis Grose”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Devil got notice that Grose was a-dying,
So, whip!  at the summons old Satan came flying;
But when he approached where poor Francis lay
moaning,
And saw each bed-post with its burden a-groaning,
Astonished, confounded, cried Satan, “By God!
I'll want him, ere I take such a damnable load!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burns immortalized Grose in two other poems.  One is kindlier,
though it gives us the same impression of Grose's size an
antiquarian Falstaff.  It begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear, Land o' Cakes, and brither Scots,<br>
Frae Maidenkirk to Johnny Groat's;<br>
If there's a hole in a' your coats,<br>
I rede you tent it:<br>
A chiel's among you, taking notes<br>
And, faith, he'll prent it.<br>
If in your bounds, ye chance to light<br>
Upon a fine, fat, fodgel wight,<br>
O' stature short, but genius bright,<br>
That's he, mark weel<br>
And wow!  he has an unco slight<br>
O' cauk and keel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Fodgel</em> is 'plump'; <em>cauk and keel</em> are 'chalk and pencil.'  The
other is a little squib, written on the envelope of a letter, and
beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ken ye ought o' Captain Grose?<br>
Igo and ago,<br>
If he's amoung his friends or foes?<br>
Iram, coram, dago.<br>
Is he south, or is he north?<br>
Igo and ago,<br>
Or drowned in the river Forth<br>
Iram, coram, dago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It continues in the same vein.  These are jokes between friends.
Noble called Grose “an inimitable boon companion.”</p>
<p>Grose wrote much, including, somewhat surprisingly, <em>A
Guide to Health, Beauty, Riches and Honour</em>.  He may have
known about honor, but not too much about the rest.  His most
lasting book was delightfully entitled <em>A Classical Dictionary of
the Vulgar Tongue</em>, and first appeared in 1785.</p>
<p>Grose has a charming passage in his introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prevent any charge of immorality being brought
against this work, the Editor begs leave to observe, that
when an indelicate or immodest word has obtruded
itself for explanation, he has endeavoured to get rid of
it in the most decent manner possible; and none have
been admitted but such, as either could not be left out,
without rendering the work incomplete, or, in some
measure, compensate by their wit, for the trespass committed
on decorum.  Indeed respecting this matter, he
can with great truth make the same defence that Falstaff
ludicrously urged in behalf of one engaged in
rebellion, viz. that he did not seek them, but that, like
rebellion in the case instanced, they lay in his way, and
he found them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pleasing example of reticence is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NICKUMPOOP,</em> or <em>NINCUMPOOP,</em> a foolish fellow; also
one who never saw his wife's ****.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>HODDY DODDY,</em> all a-se and no body, a short clumsey
person, either male or female.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More complex is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A BITER,</em> a wench whose **** is ready to bite her a-se
with a pound of butter.</p>
<p>A lascivious rampant wench.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slightly more surprising are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>PAY</em>...<em>(sea term)</em> also to beat; I will pay you as Paul
paid the Ephesians, over face and eyes, and all your
d-d jaws.</p>
<p><em>SIR REVERENCE,</em> human excrement, a t-d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pleasant is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>DAB,</em> an adept; a dab at any feat or exercise; dab,
quoth Dawkins, when he hit his wife on the a-se
with a pound of butter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>LARKING,</em> is tantalizingly defined as “a lascivious practice that
will not bear explanation.”</p>
<p>The dictionary is at its liveliest in its improprieties, and
terms relating to sex or excretion.  There are plenty of words for
bawd (ABBESS, or LADY ABBESS, AUNT, BUTTOCK BROKER,
MOTHER, SHE NAPPER, MACKAREL), and brothel (ACADEMY, or
PUSHING SCHOOL; BORDELLO; NANNY HOUSE; NUNNERY; SERAGLIO;
VAULTING SCHOOL; CAVAULTING SCHOOL).  One of the
most delightful of all entries is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ATHANASIAN WENCH, or QUICUNQUE VULT,</em> a forward
girl, ready to oblige every man that shall ask her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>CARVEL'S RING,</em> the private parts of a woman.  Hans
Carvel, a jealous old doctor, being in bed with his
wife, dreamed that the devil gave him a ring, which,
so long as he had it on his finger, would prevent his
being made a cuckold, waking he found he had got
his finger the Lord knows where.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>THINGSTABLE,</em> Mr. Thingstable, Mr. Constable, a ludicrous
affectation of delicacy in avoiding the pronunciation
of the first syllable in the title of that officer,
which is found has some similarity to an indecent
monosyllable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BITCH is said to be the “most offensive appellation that can be
given to an English woman,” and a regular answer was “I may
be a whore, but can't be a bitch.”  <em>To stand bitch</em>, however, is
'to make tea.'  A seaman catching venereal disease abroad is
said to have been “sent out a sacrifice, and came home a
BURNT offering.”  COCK LANE is the private parts of a woman.
FART CATCHER is a valet or footman, from his walking behind
his master or mistress.  FLAYBOTTOMIST is defined as “a bum
brusher, or school master.”  PLUG TAIL is one of various phrases
for the penis.  PROUD is “desirous of copulation”; SALT is
similarly used.  PUREST PURE is “a courtezan of high fashion.”
<em>Two</em> STONE <em>under weight</em> is a eunuch.  TEA VOIDER is a
chamber pot, as is MEMBER MUG.  URINAL OF THE PLANETS is
Ireland, because of the rain.  WAGTAIL is a lewd woman.
WOMBLETY CROPT is the indisposition of a drunkard.  A girl
who is got with child is said to have <em>sprained her</em> ANKLE, or <em>to
be</em> POISONED.  A STAR GAZER is a hedge whore.  A THOROUGH
GOOD-NATURED WENCH is “one who being asked to sit down,
will lie down.”</p>
<p>There is a variety of words for a <em>simpleton</em> (itself derived
from <em>Simple tony</em> or <em>Simple anthony</em>) or silly fellow.  Such are
NICK NINNY; NIGMENOG; NINNYHAMMER; NICKIN, NIKEY or
NIZEY; NIGIT (apparently “an idiot”); DOODLE; BUZZARD; CAKE
or CAKEY; CLUNCH; CULLY; MR. CUNNINGHAM; DRUMBELO;
GOOSECAP; GULL; HONEY MOON; NOCKY; NODDY; NOKES, NUPSON;
NUMBSCULL; OAF; PAPER SCULL; PUT; JOLTER HEAD;
RALPH SPOONER; SAPSCULL; SHALLOW PATE; SIMPLE SIMON;
SINGLETEN; TONY; WINDY; ADDLE PATE; BOTTLE HEAD; CLODPOLE;
COD'S HEAD.  There are various adjectives also, such as
BEETLE HEADED; BUFFLE HEADED; CHUCKLE HEADED; PUDDING
HEADED; and the like.</p>
<p><em>Drunk</em> is another word with plenty of synonyms, such as
DISGUISED, BOOSEY, FLUSTERED, FUDDLED, WRAPPED UP IN
WARM FLANNEL, IN HIS ALTITUDES, CHIRPING MERRY, CORNED,
CUT, DROP IN THE EYE, FLAWD, MAUDLIN, MELLOW, NAZIE,
SUCKY.</p>
<p><em>Hanging</em> is another, as WRY MOUTH AND A PISSEN PAIR OF
BREECHES.  CHATES or SHERIFF'S PICTURE FRAME is the gallows.
NOOZED or CRAPPED or SUS. PER COLL. is 'hanged.'  So is
<em>died of a</em> HEMPEN FEVER; a hanged man leaves a HEMPEN
WIDOW.  DERRICK, DUN, GREGORY BRANDON, and KETCH were
famous hangmen; you could say of a criminal <em>Derrick must be
his host</em>, and <em>Gregorian tree</em> was a familiar phrase.  <em>To go up the</em>
LADDER <em>to rest</em> is another phrase for being hanged; so is <em>to go
with the fall of the</em> LEAF: so is <em>to dance the</em> PADDINGTON <em>frisk</em>;
so is TRINE or TYBURN.</p>

FRENCH LEAVE, GIFT OF THE GAB, GREENHORN, HENPECKED,
to <em>be left in the</em> LURCH, to <em>sow his wild</em> OATS, PIN MONEY,
SLEEPING PARTNER, all have their modern meaning.  GLUM is
'sullen': curious to think of it as vulgar.  PHYZ is given for 'face,'
but without the derivation from <em>physiognomy</em>.  POT HUNTER,
which one used as a schoolboy for an athlete seeking a trophy,
is 'one who hunts more for the sake of the prey, than the
sport,' presumably <em>pot</em> meaning the 'contents of the stew-pot.'

the <em>ring leader</em>.  SPUNK is figuratively 'courage,' derived from a
kind of fungus (<em>punk</em>) prepared for tinder.  A BAKER'S DOZEN is

<p>Grose may have been a fubsey cull, but he was also a rum
duke.</p>
