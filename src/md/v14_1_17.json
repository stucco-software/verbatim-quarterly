Grandfather Adams has just\nbeen overheard using this locution by four grandchildren:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To betray embarrassment before us would\nhave been beneath the old gentleman's dignity,\nbut for a moment he looked a bit discountenanced.\nHe had been guilty of using slang, something he\nconsidered reprehensible in us.</p>\n<p>'A figure of speech,' he said mildly.

Kendall, <em>Narrative of the Texas Sante\nFé Expedition</em>.  When a man is disappointed in\nanything he undertakes, when he has seen\nenough, when he gets tired and sick of any job\nhe may have set himself about, he has SEEN THE\nELEPHANT.</p>\n<p>1870.  L. Oliphant, <em>Picadilly</em>.  So had Mr. Wog,\nwho went up to town to see what he called THE\nELEPHANT—an American expression signifying 'to\ngain experience of the world.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A very different meaning is noted by Farmer &amp;\nHenley in <em>Puck's Library</em>, 1889:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Forepaugh says that elephants have a natural\nliking for whiskey.  We have often wondered,\nwhen a man went out to SEE THE ELEPHANT, why\nhe always brought back such a strange odour\nwith him.  This seems to explain it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Donald Drury, Long Beach, California]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
