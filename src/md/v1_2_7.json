BYRNE'S DICTIONARY of Unusual, Obscure, and Preposterous Words</em></h1>\n<p>Josefa Heifetz Byrne, University Books, Inc., 1974</p>\n<p>Containing about 6000 entries, this book is no bargain.\nAlthough it does list unusual, obscure, and preposterous\nwords, it also lists many that are not (<em>clyster, cloaca,\nclabber, clonic, claqueur, cimmerian, cicada, chrestomathy,\ncidevant, cist, clerihew, clepsydra</em>—all words known to the\naverage literate person).  Some are inaccurately or poorly\ndefined: “<em>churriguerism</em>...grossly ornamental architecture”\ninstead of “the practice of designing grossly ornamental\narchitecture”; “<em>pleonastic</em>...pertaining to oral\nor written repetitiousness”; “<em>tribadism</em>...mutual genital fondling\nbetween lesbians.”  Inconsistencies and nonparallelisms\nabound: <em>cisatlantic</em> is in but not <em>cisalpine</em>;\n<em>tramontane</em> but not <em>cismontane; poikilothermal</em> but not\n<em>homoiothermal</em>.  Some words are not properly English at\nall, appearing to be nonce borrowings: <em>jadu, jama, jambee,\njamdani, jami, jampan, jararacussu, jasey, Jataka, jauk,\njenna, jeziah, jheel, jhool, jicara,...ka, kaaba, kaama,\nkabaya, kaberu, kaffiyeh, kaha.</em></p>\n<p>Mr. Byrne, in the Editor's Introduction, writes, “Incredible\nas it may seem, every entry in this book, even the most ludicrous, has been accepted as a formal or legitimate\nword by at least one major dictionary.  The dignity that\ngoes with endorsement by lexicographers of trusted sobriety...etc.”\nI am sorry to say that both Mr. and Mrs.\nByrne have misconstrued the function--nay, the duty--of\nthe lexicographer, who neither accepts nor rejects but, with\nscholarly aplomb, merely records.</p>\n<p>In short, it is difficult to work up much enthusiasm for\nthis book: I predict for it a long life on the warehouse\nshelves of the remainder booksellers.</p>",
