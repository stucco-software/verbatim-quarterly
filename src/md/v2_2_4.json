This was long the\nmodest boast of a North Bronx tailor.  (I recall an Esther\nWilliams film in which somebody <em>romanced</em> her in the\npool.  For a while she <em>water-repelled</em> him—until boy got\nsoggy girl).</p>\n<p>(2)  <em>Leash, Gutter and Pick Up After Your Dog Please</em>.\nThis quasi-denominatival admonition (presumably <em>pickup-after</em>\nis one word) is found on signs in Greenwich Village\nand other parts of New York City.</p>\n<p>(3)  <em>They totaled my car!</em>  So complained a colleague,\nwho had to explain to me the meaning of that all-inclusive\ntreatment in an unreliable parking garage.</p>\n<p>(4)  <em>Our party will procéss promptly at</em> 9:45 was the\npompous pronouncement of a faculty marshal at our recent\ncommencement.  A friend's son <em>commenced</em> on that occasion,\nand it was about time.</p>\n<p>(5)  <em>They refused to scholarship my son!</em>  complained\na disgruntled father.  He needn't have worried.  By now\nthey have open-admissioned him somewhere else.</p>\n<p>(6)  <em>We haven't bulletined that course this term</em>, said\na department chairman; fewer eyebrows would have raised\nif he had failed to catalogue it.</p>\n<p>(7)  A restaurant near NYU has <em>fruited jello</em>, plainly\nwith overtones of “America the Beautiful”.</p>\n<p>(8)  A woman who had never been X-rayed allegedly\nhad been <em>ultraviolated</em> in Bellevue Hospital.</p>\n<p>(9)  Various works were <em>Englished</em> centuries ago, but\nonly things like shoes and apples have been Polished, and\nwe haven't Basqued, save in the Iberian sun.  Out of ethnic\nmodesty I Welsh not.</p>\n<p>(10)  Layamon <em>Bruted</em> abroad the legend of Arthur;\nperhaps he Arthured the book in large part, too.</p>\n<p>(11)  A certain basketball team needed to learn how\nto <em>défense</em>; but it was the most offensive team in the NBA.</p>\n<p>(12)  After Nolan Ryan's no-hitter, a player on another\nteam said, “No team goes into a game thinking they're\ngoing to get no-hit.”</p>\n<p>(13)  <em>Pele then walked to the center of the field and\nfooted a token kick into a corner</em>.  He will subsequently no\ndoubt be praised for his ball <em>handling</em>.</p>\n<p>(14)  <em>Mike Marshall wild-pitched Rusty Staub into scoring\nposition</em>.</p>\n<p>(15)  But Joe Ferguson did something much more drastic\nthan that: <em>He sacrificed Garvey home!</em></p>\n<p>(16)  <em>Two young residents were arrested on misdemeanor\nloitering</em>.</p>\n<p>(17)  <em>We custom-make matching pillows</em> seems to have\nbeen written by a cousin of the water-repellent tailor.</p>\n<p>(18)  <em>Reduced rates for neutering in poor areas</em> was the\nproposal of an animal lover (?).</p>\n<p>(19)  <em>The silverware set is guaranteed as dishwasher\nproof</em>.</p>\n<p>(20)  <em>We'll give your child a Funner Summer</em> is the\npromise of a Day Camp.</p>\n<p>(21)  A response to <em>Help Murder Police</em> during one\nspell of violence: <em>Gladly</em>.</p>\n<p>(22)  <em>An analysis of the tapes will show exactly how\nstressed he was</em>, stated the author of a book on certain\nintelligence methods.</p>\n<p>(23)  <em>We intelligenced the case for months</em>, said the\nsame person.</p>\n<p>(24)  Of a somewhat different type was the verbal plea\nof a school janitor trying to avert chaos at times of class\nchanges: “Please don't conjugate in the halls!”  Conjugation\ncould, to be sure, be causative.</p>\n<p>(25)  And there is obviously something fundamentally\nwrong here: <em>But anything done to hep the anals I'm in\nfavor of</em>, which is from the same article as (18) above, in\nour local paper.</p>",
