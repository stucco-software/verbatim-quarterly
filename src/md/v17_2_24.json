Hook, (Addison-Wesley, 1990), xvii + 259pp.</p>\n<p>It seems unnecessary, when we have available\nterms like <em>informal, colloquial, formal, nonstandard,\nliterary, poetic</em>, and even <em>conversational</em> (though I\nhave never seen the last used), to come up with still\nanother set of labels, but Jules Hook, the author of a\nnumber of responsible and useful works dealing with\nEnglish, feels that FF and SWE (for 'family and\nfriends' and 'standard written English,' respectively)\ntell the user something that he might not already\nknow or feel about usages of borderline words.  Certainly,\nthere was enough confusion about <em>colloquial</em>\nto move lexicographers a few decades ago to drop it\nin favor of <em>informal</em>; but I used <em>colloquial</em> in a book I\nrecently completed on the grounds that <em>informal</em>\nseemed to be getting contaminated.  These terms\nfluctuate.  It is a comfort to know that if my book still\nmerits reprinting some decades hence, as it is in\nmachine-readable form, the publishers need only\nwrite a short program indicating that <em>informal</em> be\nsubstituted for all occurrences of <em>colloquial</em> and, like\nmagic, the switch will be effected.  Hook goes on at\nsome expressive length on the subject of FF and SWE\nand makes good sense, particularly when he emphasizes\nthe ways in which language changes, so that\nthe words classed <em>taboo or formal</em> in one generation\nmight very well change places.  Of course, the biggest\nproblem with books of this sort is that the most\nthey can expect to accomplish is to help people refine\ntheir use of the language: those whom we think\nof as needing the greatest amount of help are usually\nunaware of the fact; for them, looking up a doubtful\nusage in a book like Hook's (or anyone else's, or\neven a dictionary) would be unthinkable.  Thus, the\ngreatest service such a book could render is virtually\naborted by definition.</p>\n<p>Depending on the degree of refinement of\nwhich the user is aware, that holds true for professionals\nas well.  The other day, Reid Collins, a news\npresenter on CNN, used the expression <em>the wheres\nand the whyfors</em>, which, as far as I know, constitutes\na fractured idiom in the category of <em>I could care less</em>.\nHook has an entry for A.D./B.C. that comments on\nthe placement of A.D. before a year and of B.C. after\na year; there are “professional” editors who are unaware\nof that, so how will they know to look up the\nstyle in <em>The Appropriate Word</em> or any other style or\nusage book?  Hook is more liberal than I: for instance,\nI cannot bring myself to condone spelling\n<em>any more</em> as one word in any context.  I do not deny\nthe fact that it does not appear as one word, but if it\nis going to appear that way in anything I have written\nit will be after I am dead (and if this carping\nkeeps up, there will soon be a contract out on me).\nFor one thing, I have not noted any change in the\npronunciation of the compounded “anymore”—it\nis pronounced as if it were two words (in contrast to\n<em>anybody, anything, anyhow, anywhere</em>, etc.)—and I\nsee no justification for spelling it as a solid word.  In\nshort, I do not agree with Hook in all matters, regardless\nof the respect I have for his judgment and\nthe quality of his writing.  I have not done a careful\ncomparison among the various usage/style manuals\nto see what Hook might have that others do not, but\nI get the feeling that his work is very much up to\ndate.  If you write and wish to corroborate the style\nof what you have written, you will probably want as\nmany books of this kind as you can lay your hands\non, and it would definitely be a good idea to acquire\nthis one.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
