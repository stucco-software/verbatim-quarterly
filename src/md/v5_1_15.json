They were almost always made by that gallant\npioneer Major Breakthrough, who may not be quite the\ncliché to you that he is on our side of the Atlantic.  There is no\none to equal him in Britain today for keeping abreast of nuder\nvelopment.</p>\n<p><em>[Earl Baldwin of Bewdley, Hemel Hempstead, Herts.]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
