A monumental work first published in\n1879, by the end of the century it had sold an astonishing\n100,000 copies, an outstanding bestseller for\nthose days.  Attempts at updating it have been\nlargely unsatisfactory, for they are marred not only\nby poor choices for addenda but mainly by the deletion\nof colorful, interesting, quaint, and charming\nolder entries to make room for the new.  Fortunately,\nfacsimile editions of the original have been\npublished, and copies of early printing crop up now\nand then at reasonable prices in the antiquarian\nbook trade.</p>\n<p>It is no small wonder that Cassell commissioned\na new edition, one that would, presumably, do for\nthe 20th century what the original had done (in\npart) for the 19th.  I say “in part” because the original\ncovered the literature, folklore, and culture of\nBritain from antiquity.  Thus the present work, restricted\nto the 20th century, has a limited skein to\nunwind.  Aside from that, the main attractions of the\nearlier <em>Brewer</em> were its eminent readability, its obscure\nreferences, its curiosities, and its browsability.</p>\n<p>It is no fault of the editors that familiarity breeds\ncontempt: most of the references in this edition occurred\nwithin the living memory of many of its contemporaries,\nwhich leads one to argue with some of\nthe material.  Also, there is something about the\nbook that does not encourage the sort of browsing\none associates with the original.  It is the errors of\nfact that occasion the greatest irritation, however:\nmany of them could have been caught had the book\nbeen subjected to a careful reading by a knowledgeable\nAmerican editor, for, as will be seen, the preponderance\nof them occurs when the editors try to\ndescribe things American:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>happening</em> (1) US teenage slang...</p>\n<p><em>I would argue that the term is not slang (slang\nwords and expressions usually have a\ncounterpart in the standard language) and it is\nmost certainly not “teenage,” its origin having\nbeen in the theater.</em></p>\n<p><em>Happiness is</em>...Charles M. Schultz [twice...]</p>\n<p><em>The name is</em> Schulz.<br>\n...illusive nature of happiness...<br>\n<em>The word is</em> elusive.</p>\n<p>*Happy...*widow of Nelson Rockefeller...</p>\n<p><em>What a curious way of identifying a person</em>.<br>\nWhy is she in, anyway?</p>\n<p><em>happy clappies</em></p>\n<p><em>Should be labeled as a Briticism</em>.</p>\n<p><em>happy hour</em></p>\n<p><em>Not only not limited to British pubs but it is\nvery doubtful that the practice originated there,\nas the entry specifies</em>.</p>\n<p><em>trigger happy</em> Over ready to shoot...World WarII...</p>\n<p><em>Is “over ready” English?  More probably from\nwesterns or gangster movies of the 1930s</em>.</p>\n<p><em>hardball</em>...some amateurs and children use a soft\nball...</p>\n<p><em>Professional women's teams do, too.  And the\nword is</em> softball: <em>it is not a “soft ball.”</em></p>\n<p><em>hard dog</em> US police slang of the 1980s for a dog\nowned by a criminal and trained to attack.\n<em>Who makes up these entries?</em></p>\n<p><em>hard sell</em>...Salespersons using the technique...\nmake dishonest or exaggerated claims for the\nproduct.  ...The practice is widely used by\nholiday timeshare companies who...lure\npeople...to buy a share in a property, which\nmost can ill afford.</p>\n<p><em>Although the basic definition</em> ('aggressive\nmarketing') <em>is essentially correct, the term\nrefers to salesmanship, not the (broader)\nconcept of “marketing.”  There is nothing\ninherent in</em> hard sell <em>to imply dishonest\nprocedures, and whether a customer can afford\nsomething he buys is totally irrelevant</em>.</p>\n<p><em>hard shoulder</em> The raised roughly surfaced strip\nrunning along the edge of a motorway, which\nis used for emergency stops.  It is illegal to\nuse—or stop on—the hard shoulder for any\nreason that is not an emergency.</p>\n<p><em>Ignoring the bad writing, it is wrong to say that\nthe hard shoulder is raised: in fact, it is often\nthe roadway that is raised above the hard\nshoulder, which, besides, is not necessarily\nroughly surfaced (though it might be paved in\nasphalt alongside a macadam roadway).  And\nwhat relevance has a law in such a definition?</em></p>\n<p><em>Hardy family</em> An insufferable fictional family...\n<em>In retrospect, perhaps, but when I was a lad, we\nnever missed one of the films, and they were\nenormously popular</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Harlem toothpick</em>... As a switch-blade knife it\nfeatures in 'Mac the knife,' a well-known song\nby Kurt Weill...(1928).</p>\n<p><em>Neither</em> Harlem toothpick <em>nor</em> switchblade\nknife <em>is mentioned in</em> The Threepanny Opera.\n<em>As it is the lyrics that are relevant, they were\ntranslated by Marc Blitzstein from Bertold\nBrecht's original.  The name is spelled</em> Marc the\nKnife, <em>who is a character in the</em> Opera, <em>not\nmerely a song</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Hashbury</em>...It involves a play on the word\n<em>HASH,</em> the smoking of which was central to the\nhippie lifestyle.</p>\n<p><em>Most hippies smoked grass (marijuana), not</em>\nhash (<em>hashish), which was harder to come by\nand too expensive</em>.</p>\n<p><em>keep it under your hat</em>...The US version was\n'Keep it under your stetson'.</p>\n<p><em>Balderdash!  The “stetson” version was a joking\nparaphrase</em>.</p>\n<p><em>hatikvah</em></p>\n<p><em>Why not capitalized?</em></p>\n<p><em>and that ain't hay</em>...it means: 'don't turn your\nnose up at that, it's not to be ignored'.  It was\nused as the title of an Abbott and Costello film\nin 1943.</p>\n<p><em>It means 'and that's not insignificant.'  The\ncorrect title of the film was</em> That Ain't Hay.</p>\n<p><em>Hays office</em>...formed in response to growing\npublic indignation at sexual boldness on the\nscreen and the unsuitable behaviour off screen\nof some film stars, notably FATTY Arbuckle.</p>\n<p><em>It is worth mentioning that the main\ncharacteristic of the Hays office censorship\nstandards included forbidding the showing of a\nmarried couple in the same bed (fully clothed).\nOnly certain (puritanical) segments of the public\nwere indignant at the stars' behaviour off screen:\nmost drank it up.  In view of the fact that the\nentry for Fatty Arbuckle mentions that he was\nexonerated, the comment here is at worst\nlibelous and at best unfair.</em></p>\n<p><em>headhunt</em> To seek out a person already in\nemployment and offer him or her a post,\nusually at a higher level, in a company\ninvolved in the same kind of business.</p>\n<p><em>Almost completely wrong (for the US): the\nperson need not be employed; and neither the\nlevel nor the kind of business has anything to do\nwith it.  An executive of a steel plant might be\nheadhunted to direct a company making\nairplane parts or computers.  The emphasis is\nusually on recruiting executive talent</em>.</p>\n<p><em>A heartbeat away from the presidency</em>...it is\nprobably meant to focus the voters' attention\non the [vice-presidential] candidate's potential.\n<em>Nothing of the kind.  It is used to play on the\nfear of the people lest they elect a vice president\nunsuitable to become president, a position he\nmight have to fill at a moment's notice.  The\nexpression arose during Eisenhower's\nadministration</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Eat your heart out!</em>...'I can do as well as you\ncan, mate', or 'It's time to watch out, you have\na rival.'</p>\n<p><em>The phrase means 'to be consumed by one's own\nfeelings of envy.'</em></p>\n<p><em>the heat</em> (1) Slang for the police.  The term\noriginated in US Black street jargon...</p>\n<p><em>Not “jargon”—slang</em>.</p>\n<p><em>heavy</em> (1) Slang from the HIPPIE and youth culture\nof the late 1960s and early 1970s for serious,\nimportant, or meaningful, <em>e.g.</em> a heavy date.</p>\n<p><em>The term was in use long before hippies were a\ngleam in anyone's eye; it is probably an\nextension from the theatrical term for the villain\nof the piece, later transferred to mean 'serious,\nimportant.'</em></p>\n<p><em>heavy hitter</em>...</p>\n<p><em>How can one have this entry without mentioning\nits metaphoric origins in baseballs?</em></p>\n<p><em>heebie-jeebies</em> (1) Slang for a state of apprehension\nand fearfulness.</p>\n<p><em>Insert “nervous” before apprehension.  In (2),\nfor that read than.</em></p>\n<p>*here we go, here we go, here we go...*to the tune\nof 'Stars and Stripes for Ever'...</p>\n<p><em>The title of the John Philip Sousa march is</em> The\nStars and Stripes Forever.</p>\n<p>*High ho, Silver...*spurring on his grey steed,\nSilver.</p>\n<p><em>In the first place, it is “Hi-oh, Silver.”  In the\nsecond, the horse is white, not “grey.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The book is riddled with such errors and misconceptions,\napparently owing to the fact that no knowledgeable\nAmerican editor was engaged to review.\nthe material.  It says, for instance, that <em>The Three\nStooges'</em> films “had a comparatively short life,” obviously\nunaware that they are still shown regularly on\nAmerican television.  (<em>WSBK</em> Boston runs them continuously\non New Year's Eve day every year.)  It defines\n<em>sting</em> as 'a robbery or con trick,' when, in fact,\nthe term refers to only one of several phases in a\ncarefully orchestrated confidence game.  The entry\n<em>swat team</em> should be shown as <em>SWAT team</em>, and it is\nnot slang.  And at <em>cry all the way to the bank</em> one\nreads “A later sarcastic version is <em>laugh all the way\nto the bank</em>.”  The person who wrote that could use a\nreview course on the meaning of <em>sarcastic</em>.</p>\n<p>I am informed that this book has received uniformly\nfavorable reviews and that it is selling like\nhotcakes.  The reader may draw his own conclusions\nabout the ignorance of critics and the gullibility of\nthe public.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps unfair to review the <em>Bloomsbury\nDictionary of Phrase &amp; Allusion</em> alongside the\n<em>Brewer's Twentieth Century:</em> despite the similarity of\nthe titles, the former is a slighter work; also, it consists\nlargely of quotations and the titles of books,\nplays, films, and other written works traceable to\nthem (and vice versa).  The writting is better, however,\nit is generally more accurate (though it, too,\nmisspells Charles M. Schulz's name), and there is a\nlittle overlap.  For instance, the name of the Abbott\nand Costello movie is (correctly given as <em>That Ain't\nHay</em>,) though it adds the suggestion that the film\nprobably gave currency to the expression, which is\nquite far from the fact.  The orientation of the two\nbooks is different: the interval of fourteen pages covered\nin the comments on the new <em>Brewer</em> (which\nincludes 146 entries) occupies only eight pages in\nthe <em>Bloomsbury</em> (which has 81 entries, both counts\nincluding cross references); of these, only about a\ndozen appear in both books.</p>\n<p>The point of departure of Rees's book is literary\nreferences, while that of the new <em>Brewer</em> is popular\nculture as reflected in catch-phrases.  Provided that\nthe user makes sure to double-check the information\nin both books and is not tempted to accept as gospel\neverything encountered in either work, both books\nshould be considered useful additions to a reference\nlibrary.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
