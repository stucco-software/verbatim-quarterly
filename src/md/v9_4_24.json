South Miami, Florida</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Ye</em> of, for example, <em>Ye Olde Tea Shoppe</em>, has never\nbeen anything else in English but 'The,' and properly so\npronounced.  As a definite article already in the English of 600\nto 1100 A.D., the <em>ye</em> in question was never confused, before the\nend of the fifteenth century, with the also now archaic pronoun\n<em>ye</em>.  The present mispronunciation “YEE” for the definite article\nis owing to an alphabetic character change.  The Anglo-Saxon\n(or Old English) writing system had five letters which vanished\nfrom our alphabet centuries ago.  Two of these characters,\nknown as <em>thorn</em> and <em>eth</em> (or <em>edh</em>), were used interchangeably for\nthe contrasting voiced/voiceless consonant sounds today represented\nby the <em>th</em>- digraph, as in <em>thy/thigh, either/ether, thou/\nthousand, this/thistle, them/theme, bathe/bath</em>, etc.; the consistently\nvoiced sound of <em>they, their, these, those, that, then,\nthough</em>, etc.; or the consistently voiceless sound of <em>thin, think,\nthank, thirst, three, third, thirty</em>, etc.</p>\n<p>Thus, one of the ways to spell Old English 'the' was: “þe.”\nWritten carelessly, sans serifs, “þe” became “þe.”  Written even\nmore carelessly the result was “þe,” which resembled “ye,” and\nwhen, in the earliest days of printing, printers substituted the\ntype character nearest to the thorn, namely “y,” people soon\nforgot why the almost-look-alike <em>y</em> appeared on signboards and\nthe like and began mispronouncing words with this\nsubstitution.</p>\n<p>Take a look, for example, at William Shakespeare's famous\nauto-epitaph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GOOD FREND FOR IESVS SAKE FORBEARE,<br>\nTO DIGG THE DVST ENCLOASED \\?\\:<br>\nBLESS BE \\?\\ MAN \\?\\ SPARES \\?\\S STONES<br>\nAND CVRST BE HE \\?\\ MOVES MY BONES.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the custom of the times (W.S. died in 1616), the above\ntwo lines would have normally appeared as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Blest be \\?\\ man \\?\\ spares \\?\\ stones,<br>\nAnd cvrst be he \\?\\ moves my bones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nowadays, the only public exposure the old “Y-thorn” gets\nis in authentic inn signs and the like... and in countless quasi-antique\nmisusages of “Ye” by those seeking quaintness.</p>\n<p>The coalesced \\?\\ of “BLESE” and of “\\?\\”; the\nsuperscribed E of “\\?\\” and T of “\\?\\”; and the V for U of\n“CVRST” are all regular for the times, as are the elevated and\nunderscored lower-case fonts in the normal form.</p>\n<p>And while we're examining the orthography of this epitaph,\nnote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FREND   —    This spelling of c. 1600 would have given\nus 382 years of peace had it stuck.</p>\n<p>IESVS  —    Note V, for later U, in those days, and the\noverlarge capital I, with divine overtones;\n“J” also came later.</p>\n<p>FORBEARE HEARE  —  The spelling and rhyming of these two words is quite accurate for c. 1600; the rhyme was closer to today's <em>hair</em>.</p>\n<p>DIGG    —    The <em>Ormulum</em>, by 1300, had set the style\nfor doubling the consonant letter following\ncertain vowel letters miscalled “short.”</p>\n<p>DVST   —     Another V—for its successor, U—standard\nfor the times.</p>\n<p>ENCLOASED  — Note both the spelling of the vowel-sound\nand the trisyllabicity.</p>\n<p>BLESE —      The “final-e” question was far from resolved\nin 1600; likewise the consonant-letter\ndoubling, or voiceless -<em>ed</em> matter.</p>\n<p>THES   —     Here there were all sorts of conflicts: the\nsingle-consonant letter following the vowel-\nletter miscalled “long”; the marking with a\nfinal -<em>e</em> of such vowel sounds; the voicing of\nthe monosyllable-final sound spelled with a\nsingle -<em>s</em>, whether followed by final -<em>e</em> or\nnot.  This so-called silent -<em>e</em> question has yet\nto be resolved, witness: <em>geese, goose, loose,</em>\n<em>moose, noose, dose, close</em> adj., <em>use</em> n., etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just accept antique <em>Ye</em> (pronounced THE, and so “translated”),\nand add it to your list of English spelling curios... like\nthe <em>f</em> of <em>of</em>; the <em>o</em> of <em>woman, women</em>, or of <em>choir</em> (or <em>choir</em> on\nother counts); or <em>ewe</em>, or <em>eye</em>, or <em>who</em>, or <em>two</em>; or <em>one, once,\nouija</em> (WEEJY), and <em>bologna</em> (BALONEY)... and remember that\nthe language is still changing all the time, now as “in days of\nyore,” <em>tho some knights are just tougher to</em> unhorse.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
