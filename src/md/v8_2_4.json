The late Theodore M.

Un-Januslike,\nthese double headers can scarcely be regarded as household\ngods, lares and penates guarding access to that\nabode where our common sense resides.  What would or\ncould a visitor from outer space (or even from the next\nparking space) make of this headline in <em>The Pittsburgh\nPress</em> on the day following Election Day 1980?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>REAGAN ROLLS UP HUGE VICTORY;<br>\nSPECTER TOPS STATE GOP SURGE</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One suspects that Reagan and his Republican colleagues\nhad help from a revenant from the Great\nBeyond.  A later headline casts aspersions on the President's\ngolf game:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>REAGAN FIRES 1,845</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One might expect the following head in Chicago, the\nWindy City, but this one led into an AP dispatch\npublished in a Washington newspaper:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PENTAGON WON'T MOVE GAS</p>\n<p>(Gastroenterologists please copy.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The paraphernalia of sports being what it is, the reader\nmay easily become convinced that Central American\npolitics might well have taken on the trappings of\nathletic events, deposed officials carrying away whatever\nthey can lay their hands on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SOMOZA IS REPORTEDLY READY<br>\nTO FLEE WITH SUPPORTERS</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Audrey of the same name might be pleased (surprised?)\nto learn that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JOCKS SPILL AT MEADOWS</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rodolfo, Colline, et al. would probably have had less\nsympathy for their heroine had they known about her\nfirst husband's shenanigans:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MIMI'S FIRST TOSSES JOCK—AFTER VICTORY</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moving right along, we have all been impressed by\nPope John Paul's vigor; does his versatility know no\nbounds?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>POPE'S 63-YARD PUNT RETURN SPARKS EAST WIN</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... and, as any Oxonian can tell you, 63-yard punts are a\nrarity on the Isis.</p>\n<p>Indecent exposure (except of the feet) imperils clean\nsport, as this banner bears witness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>STREAKING LYNN LEADS SOX</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Staunchly maintaining that white man's inhumanity is\nfor the birds,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>STREAKING INDIANS RIP JAYS</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The line has been drawn, we are pleased to note,\nagainst participation by athletes in the face of major\norgan impairment, reported as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>INJURED LIVERS MAY NOT PLAY</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is an etymology afoot for <em>kick the bucket</em> holding\nthat <em>bucket</em> comes from French <em>bouchet,</em> some sort of\nframe on which animals were strung up for slaughtering\nin the abattoirs of Paris (or of the Midwest).  It appears\nthat the uncooperative beasts were known to “kick the\nbouchet, or bucket” in their death throes.  Little wonder,\nthen, at this news from Fayetteville, Arkansas:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TWO PORKERS SUSPENDED</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Representatives of Walesa's Solidarity have surfaced in\nWashington state:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DAMAGED POLE BLACKS OUT OKANOGAN VALLEY</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hepatitis being a somewhat less than desirable affliction,\none can be only grateful for the health authorities\nwho forbid the taking of clams, oysters, etc., in our tidal\nwaters.  But this is going a bit too far:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WARNING ON ALL SOUND SHELLFISH</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And leave it to the Californians to take the Equal Rights\nbusiness just one step too far:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HOMOSEXUAL TO REPLACE MILK</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Pacific Northwest being what it is, this intelligence\nfrom the <em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em> (Oct. 17, 1980) need\nnot be viewed with alarm:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CHIPS FLY AS BEAVERS AND DICKS MEET</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, finally, it would appear to be in doubt whether\npenal institutions had the right to incarcerate those with\nthe pox:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ESCAPE ARTIST BELIEVED SPOTTED</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—at least one might expect an accurate diagnosis.</p>",
