Since I started publishing\nVERBATIM, these and other word-coiners have been sending\ntheir creations to me, pressing for recognition. (I cannot\nproperly call them <em>neologists</em>, for that name should be reserved\nfor those who study <em>neologisms</em>, which are new\nwords that have been accepted into the language, not ones\nstill in the proposal stage.)</p>\n<p>Professional lexicographers, always on the lookout for\nnew words and meanings, have generally established as a\nstandard for recording neologisms in their dictionaries the\nrepeated appearance of the word or meaning in media of\nsufficiently large exposure to indicate acceptance by English\nspeakers. Those who attempt to persuade lexicographers to\nlist novel concoctions are unaware of our function, which is\nto describe the lexicon of a language, and that means its\nword stock; the lexicon of English does not include the fancies\nof people who have discovered the technique of putting\nmorphological elements together.</p>\n<p>Some of the coinages in this book are jocular; though I\nenjoy a (good) joke as much as the next fellow, I fail to see\nanything funny about words like <em>volnic</em> ('an imaginary part\nof a carburetor') and <em>gafahvitz</em> ('the tool used to adjust a\nvolnic'). Some coinages are simply awful because they are\nhybrids, that is, made up of Germanic and Greek or Latin\nparts: <em>baldephobia</em> ('fear of going bald') is an example. If\nsuch a word is needed, it ought to be <em>alopeciaphobia</em> or\n<em>calvophobia</em>, both hybrids but at least with parts of the\nsame vintage; but the real question is whether the word has\nany use in the language (except for the vain fellow who\ncoined it). Other coinages can be attributed to those who\nare unaware that a word with the needed meaning already\nexists. Why coin <em>spork</em> when <em>runcible spoon</em>, from <em>runcible</em>,\nitself coined by Edward Lear, already exists? The <em>foon</em>\nreferred to under <em>spork</em> in this book is a utensil with a fork\nat one end and a spoon at the other, reminiscent of the odd\ngadgets once popular with the manufacturers of novelties\nfor the premium market. I recall a comb with a shoehorn as\na handle; made of plastic, it was a giveaway at the Times\nSquare Hotel in New York in the 1940s. Such combinations\ncan make the imagination take flights of fancy: how about a\ntoothbrush with a blackhead squeezer at the other end? or a\ncombination of eyecup and eyelash curler? or a nail file\nwith a toothpick?</p>\n<p>This book is full of similar strange combinations-of\nwords, that is, not gadgets. The language is difficult enough\nto deal with as it is, and I lose my sense of humor with\nitems like <em>lexiconia</em>, <em>fuzztache</em>, <em>willectomy</em>, and the rest.\nThose who are willing to spork out $12.95 (about 13¢ each)\nfor this sort of nonsense are welcome to it. Two more\npoints: I am not averse to coining words myself and am\nresponsible for <em>thimblewit</em>. Second, Sherk lists <em>Norsex</em> as the\nlogical companion (in the north of England) to <em>Wessex</em>, (in\nthe West), <em>Sussex</em>, (in the south), <em>Essex</em>, (in the east), and\n<em>Middlesex</em>, (in the middle): as for what the English up north\ndid for their sex, I'm surprised he hasn't heard of <em>Norfolk</em>.\nThe latest news, good or bad, depending on your viewpoint,\nis that a second version is on the way.</p>\n<p><em>[L.U.]</em></p>",
