Such forms, were however,\ngenerally corrected by restoration of the r-sound, with varying\ndevelopments, giving variants such as the MnE <em>learn</em>,\nand its dialect equivalent, <em>larn</em>.  Such forms are examples of\nregression, which could occasionally be a little too correct,\nproducing r-pronunciations in words where the <em>r</em> is not\nhistoric.
