Crowley, Gale Research Co., 1975</p>\n<p>As some of our readers may know, since 1953 Gale\nResearch Company has published a series of valuable reference\nbooks, like the <em>Encylopedia of Associations</em> (9th\nedition, 1975), a <em>Directory of Special Libraries and Information\nCenters</em> (3rd edition, 1974), <em>Contemporary Authors</em>\n(containing bio-bibliographical information on more\nthan 38,000 current authors), and others.  The volume under\nreview here is a 1975 supplement to <em>The Acronyms\nand Initialisms Dictionary</em> (4th edition, 1973) that includes\na 1974 supplement.</p>\n<p>We usually define an acronym as a pronounceable\nword made up of the first letters or syllables of the name\nof an organization, product, etc.  Thus, familiar acronyms\nas <em>Jeep</em> (<em>GP</em> vehicle = General <em>Purpose</em> vehicle), <em>Nabisco</em>\n(<em>National Biscuit Company</em>), <em>radar</em> (<em>radio detecting and\nranging</em>), <em>laser</em> (_light a_mplification by stimulated _e_mission\nof _r_adiation), etc.  We are not quite certain what the editor\nof <em>NAI</em> means by 'acronym' for, in the Foreword to\n<em>NAI</em> she refers to <em>MFSB</em> (Mother, Father, Sister, Brother)\nas an acronym, and it's bevond us how one pronounces\n<em>MFSB</em> as a word ([?]?).  She also identifies\n<em>WFL</em> and <em>WTT</em> as acronyms, though we couldn't\nimagine pronunciations other than [\\ill] and\n[\\ill].  Those, to us, are abbreviations.  Abbreviations\nare distinguished from acronyms in that\nthey consist of only the initial letters of a title name\nand are usually unpronounceable (except as a sequence\nof names of alphabetical characters), like <em>NBC</em>, <em>CBS</em>,\nand <em>ABC</em>.  There is, it must be acknowledged, an area\nwhere the two overlap as in <em>SNCC</em>, normally an unpronounceable\nsequence, which is actually pronounced\n[snIk], and in <em>AID</em> (American Institute of Decorators) and\n<em>ACTH</em> (_a_drenocorticotropic _hor_mone), which though quite\npronounceable, never are in practice.  This overlap, however,\ncan be resolved by proper linguistic research that\nwould determine whether a given item is, in fact, pronounced\nas a word or as a sequence of names of alphabetical\ncharacters.  Unfortunately, <em>NAI</em> doesn't resolve this\nquestion, for it simply lists the entry and follows the listing\nwith the fully spelled-out form, offering no further\ninformation.</p>\n<p>As a reference book, its value is thereby undiminished;\nbut as anything but an unedited list of acronyms and abbreviations\nits usefulness to the linguist and lexicographer\nis limited by the paucity of attendant information.</p>\n<p>This Gale book is expensive if the purchaser considers\nonly such factors as composition, paper, printing, and\nbinding.  But when consideration is given to the fact that\nGale's is the only game in town, the price must be evaluated\nin terms of how badly one needs the information it\ncontains: if you cannot do without it, <em>New Acronyms and\nInitialisms</em> is not too expensive at $30 for a 131-page,\nlarge-format, softcover book.  (Incidentally, <em>NAI</em>, at $30,\ncontains 19,000 terms, while the <em>Acronyms and Initialisms\nDictionary</em>, at $27.50, contains 103,000.)</p>\n<p>Turning to the entries themselves, little can be added\nto this review save to comment on the amusement and\nspeculation raised by some of them.  One would think that\nan abbreviation or acronym comes about not only because\nthe original term is too long but because it is very frequently\nused in conversation, or writing, or both.  Therefore,\nwe were somewhat mystified by the circumstances\nrequiring shortening of terms like <em>Amicale des Anciens\nVolontaires Fran√ßais en Espagne Republicaine</em> (<em>AVER</em>),\n<em>Business Office Must</em> (<em>BOM</em>), <em>Flat-Tile Roof</em> (<em>FTR</em>),\n<em>Mean Time Between Unscheduled Removal</em> (<em>MTBUR</em>),\nand <em>Stealing Takes Everyone's Money</em> (<em>STEM</em>)--the last\nof which we can imagine no context for even when freeassociating.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that English and other languages\nhave added to their lexicons through the use of acronyms,\nand <em>New Acronyms and Initialisms</em>, together with its predecessor,\ncan provide a valuable collection for study of\nthis aspect of word-building.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
