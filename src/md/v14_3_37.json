Much earlier, Borgmann and others developed\ncharade sentences, such as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flamingo pale, scenting a latent shark.<br>\nFlaming, opalescent in gala tents—hark!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>J.A. Lindon called the phonetic equivalent of diliterals\n“stutterances” (<em>Word Ways,</em> August 1972) such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Al, be no albino.<br>\nAuntie, this is antithesis.<br>\nAgreed a greedy man, “Demand Patty's patties.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In connection with Norman Shapiro's letter\n[XIV,1], he may be interested to know that there exist\nat least two articles in <em>Nauka i Zhizh</em> on Russian palindromic\npoems; both articles have been translated by\nHaim Kilov and S. El'Man and appear in the February\n1984 and August 1987 issues of <em>Word Ways.</em>  Herbert\nPfeiffer published in <em>Neue Texte</em> (an Austrian poetry\njournal) a German palindrome about one page long; a\ncopy of it appears in the May 1985 <em>Word Ways,</em> together\nwith a partial translation.</p>\n<p>However, he (and other readers) will be most interested\nto hear that Señor José María Albaigés Y\nOlivart, Numancía 87, Esc. B., 12.3, 3.a, Barcelona\n29, Spain, has formed an International Palindromists'\nClub with the object of exchanging ideas and publishing\ndiscoveries in this field.  In June 1987 the club issued\na 38-page newsletter to its members, detailing\nwhat had up to then been learned.  It is written in\nSpanish, but there are English translations for many of\nthe items.  Anyone writing to them would, I am sure,\nbe welcomed with open arms.</p>\n<p><em>[A. Ross Eckler, Morristown, New Jersey]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
