Halsey</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Editorial Director,Christopher G. Morris, Editor.</span></em>\n<em>Macmillan, 1975</em></p>\n<p>Let the dictionary first define itself: “A book that has\nwords of a language arranged in alphabetical order, together\nwith information about them.  This dictionary tells\nwhat words mean, how they are spelled, how they are\nused, how they are pronounced, and where they come\nfrom.”  And how does this one measure up?  Very well, on\nthe whole.  It gives more than this quiet definition promises,\nnot only in what it presents, but in how.</p>\n<p>Assuming age 12 as the limit of “child” is easier for\nthe child than for the elders (it makes <em>us</em> all that much\nolder); but some of the <em>MDC</em> definitions are hardly childlike.\nFor example, <em>diaphragm</em>, 2: 'A disk used to change\nsound into electrical signals, or to change electrical signals\ninto sound.  It is used in telephones and microphones.'\nThus the “for children” in the title might well deprive this\nbook of some of its most responsive and needful readers.\nOh, for the day when the stuffier world of letters breaks\ndown and owns in print the best word we have, the one\nwe all use: This is a <em>kids'</em> dictionary--and <em>kids</em> is a word\n<em>they</em> use, accept, and are reluctant to part with.</p>\n<p><em>MDC</em> is a pretty good book, with information on\netymology and pronunciation and definitions that don't\ndepend on the well-done illustrations.  The definitions are,\non the whole, well-said, concise, and helpful, and not condescending.\nThey make the way to an intermediate dictionary\neasy and natural.  The definition is given first, immediately\nafter the headword which--praises be!--doesn't\nbother with the traditional and usually unetymological syllable\nbreaks.  Then come verbal illustrations, which are\ngenerous, and then the headword again, followed by pronunciations,\nparts of speech, and plurals or past tenses.\nEtymologies are not provided for every entry, but are\ngiven for some of the interesting and simple ones, e.g.\n<em>pasteurize, kindergarten</em>.  Also helpful is a note occurring\nat homophones, e.g. <em>knight</em> says: “another word that\nsounds like this is <em>night</em>.”</p>\n<p>The definitions and the words selected for entry are\nbasically sound; but limiting a <em>plumber</em> to water pipes is\npretty narrow, and defining <em>Nazi</em> in terms that make one\nsound no worse than a Whig or a Tory seems odd; so does\nrestricting the definition of <em>Jew</em> to 'A person whose religion\nis Judaism.'  The definition of <em>reservation</em> won't delight Indians;\nand defining middle age as 40-60 without specifying\nold or young is amusing.</p>\n<p>Kids sometimes go to a dictionary to look up words\nthat scare or puzzle them and that they instinctively don't\nask adults.  <em>MDC</em> does quite well here with the likes of\n<em>cancer, divorce</em>, and <em>alcoholism;</em> it is less helpful on sex.\nThough <em>male, female, mammal</em>, and <em>breast</em> are well said,\n<em>pregnant</em> is not even entered--a ridiculous omission in a\nbook that defines <em>tetanus, overture</em>, and <em>marsupial</em>.  Religious\nbias, if any, seems Christian.  <em>Crucifixion, Mass,\nChristmas</em>, and <em>Easter</em> are all in; <em>Passover</em> is, but not <em>seder,\nmenorah, Purim, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah</em>--and <em>Israel</em>\nand <em>Israeli</em> are defined with no mention of Jews.</p>\n<p>A happy forward-looking note is the inclusion of\nmetric definitions, e.g. at <em>kilometer, meter, gram, liter</em>.\nSome headwords are followed not by definitions but simply\nby a series of verbal illustrations: <em>the, and, to, yet, but,\nis</em> are handled thus.  Some of the verbal illustrations are less\nthan helpful.  At <em>calico:</em> “Sara has a calico cat.”</p>\n<p>Pronunciations try to be fair, but essentially represent\neastern U.S. Praises to the realistic “poinsetta” in the\nsame moment of bewilderment over the pedantic 3-syllable\nnotation of <em>licorice</em>, though both the -<em>iss</em> and the -<em>ish</em> forms\nare given.</p>\n<p>A brief practical test, based on ten words chosen at\nrandom from Charles M. Schulz's <em>Snoopy Come Home</em>\n(1962) and <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em>\n(1973 printing of the first of C.S. Lewis's Narnia Chronicles),\nshows <em>MDC</em> doing fairly well by both authors.\nNarnia's <em>reindeer, enormous, pillar, hatchet, exclaim,\nshrug</em>, and <em>larch</em> are in; <em>sledge</em> (a vehicle), <em>Turkish De-light</em>,\nand <em>rampant</em> are not.  From <em>Snoopy</em>..., the notorious\n<em>mad punter</em> is covered at <em>mad</em> but not at <em>punt</em> or <em>punter</em>;\nand when the question is, “Is there no stopping that\n<em>fiend?</em>”, <em>MDC</em> omits <em>fiend</em>.  The definition at <em>vulture</em>, on the\nother hand, is excellent; <em>stew, burglar, ancestor</em>, and <em>frustrated</em>\nare all right; <em>loathe</em> is left out; and though the word\ndoesn't occur in this book, Linus's friends will miss the\n<em>ophthalmologist</em>.</p>\n<p>...which brings us to the pictures, where kids are\npresented in various shapes and colors, and several are\nwearing glasses.  The sizes of the pictures are often out of\nproportion, especially in the natural history area where\n<em>trout</em> and <em>whale</em> are both 2½” long; some illustrations are\ntoo cluttered--the <em>stoop</em> is barely visible, since it is filled\nby six people of various colors plus a dog and a cat, and\nfor good measure there's a white man and a caged bird\nlooking out the window.</p>\n<p>But by and large, <em>MDC</em> is a good dictionary for\nyoung readers.  It is less helpful for young <em>hearers</em>, since\nprofanity, obscenity, and ethnic slurs are all absent.  Perhaps\nit's about time we aired these and said point blank\nthat they are offensive?</p>\n<p><em>Audrey R. Duckert, University of Massachusetts</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
