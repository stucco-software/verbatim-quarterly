Kimmelman</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Philadelphia</span></em></p>\n<p>In an essay published recently in a history journal,\nthe editor substituted “foul ups” for the correct\nterm I had used in referring to certain incidents witnessed\nduring army days.  For quoting a Vietnam-era\nline of graffiti, “Fighting for peace is like fxxxing (my\ncryptic spelling throughout) for chastity,” the witty\ncolumnist Molly Ivins was blasted in a long letter to\nthe editor of <em>The Progressive</em>.  In contrast, we have the\nstory about the ten-year-old who, caving in to the\nnagging of his ever-suspicious grandmother, admits\nthat his grandfather did indeed let slip a “dirty” word\n(<em>shmuck</em>) on their fishing trip, but won't quote it:\n“What I can tell you is that it rhymes with fxxx.”  And\nthere is the story of the touching letter in a shaky script\nfrom a ninety-year-old in the nursing home, thanking\nthe community service people for the gift of the transistor\nradio with ear-piece that freed her from having\nto share the radio of her roommate, Mrs. Hamady, and\nnow she can tell Mrs. Hamady “to go fxxx herself.”</p>\n<p>My interest in the life and times of the word stems\ndirectly from a recollected bit of army business during\nWorld War II.  In early 1942, a bizarre directive came\ndown from on high, one of a kind in the memory of\narmy “lifers,” or regulars.  Issued by Lt. General\nMacNair, commander of all U. S. ground troops, it\nstated that less authoritarianism and greater courtesy\nmust thenceforth characterize all orders to enlisted\nmen, and it closed with “the day of the shouting sergeant\nis over.”  It was to be read to all formations.  Our\nregimental commander used the opportunity to append\nan order of his own to all company-grade officers\nto make special efforts “forthwith” to eliminate the use\nof obscene language in their commands.</p>\n<p>As a junior officer in charge of an infantry medical\ndetachment, this assignment was mine.  On a\nmuggy morning in Camp Livingston, Louisiana, the\nregular business of reveille completed by 6:30, I read\nout General MacNair's directive.</p>\n<p>“Any questions?”</p>\n<p>“Question, sir!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Sergeant Willard.”  This was an “old” national\nguardsman of 30, a barker, heart and soul of the\noutfit.</p>\n<p>“May I say, sir,” shouting, “that when the day of\nthe shouting sergeant is over, on that day the army will\nhave died, sir!”  preceded and followed by the snappiest\nsalute in that man's army.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Sergeant Willard.  Now — any questions?”</p>\n<p>Nothing but grinning faces.  “I will now read the\norder of the regimental commanding officer.  Subject:\nobscene language.  To: All regimental personnel.”\nThere followed a paragraph linking decent language\nand decent conduct.  I wound up with, “You know\nwhat that means.  From now on, the <em>fxxx</em> word is taboo\n!  Dismissed!”  No questions solicited.</p>\n<p>Perhaps three seconds of perfect silence.  Then the\ndam burst.</p>\n<p>“Taboo you, Thorp!”</p>\n<p>“Where's Taboo-up Metcalf?”</p>\n<p>“You're asking for it, Taboo-face!”</p>\n<p>“Delgado, get this tabooing morning report to\nregimental!”</p>\n<p>It became a party.</p>\n<p>Nearly three years later, in January 1945, I arrived\nas a P.O.W. at Stalag IV B, in Muhleberg, East Germany,\npart of a battered lot of several hundred American\nsoldiers trapped and finally taken prisoner in the\nBattle of the Bulge.  Stalag IV B housed mostly British\nenlisted men, about seven thousand at the time, and\nthough the camp never attained the notoriety of some\nother grim stalags, it entered the literature unnamed\nin <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>, the novel by Kurt Vonnegut.\nThe portrayal of the camp and the reception by the\nBritish P.O.W.s, camouflaged though it is, is so vivid\nthat on reading it when it appeared in 1969—and\nsince—I have found myself transported back there,\nfrozen feet and all.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...out marched 50 middle-aged Englishmen.</p>\n<p>They were singing, “Hail, Hail the Gang's all Here”\n...These lusty ruddy vocalists were among the\nfirst English-speaking prisoners to be taken in the\nSecond World War.  Now they were singing to\nnearly the last...The Englishmen were clean\nand enthusiastic and decent and strong...They\nwere adored by the Germans, who thought they\nwere exactly what Englishmen ought to be.</p>\n<p>The Englishmen had never had guests before and\nthey went to work like darling elves, sweeping,\nmopping, cooking, baking...</p>\n<p>There was silence now, as the Englishmen looked\nin astonishment at the frowzy creatures they had so\nlustily waltzed inside...“My God, what have\nthey done to you, lad?  This isn't a man.  It's a broken\nkite!</p>\n<p>— <em>Slaughterhouse-Five or The Children's Crusade</em>,\nDelta Book, Dell Publishing Co., 1969,\npp. 80-84.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The take-charge British prisoners dazzled us, as\nthey had Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim.  Bedraggled, starving\nand exhausted after a final four days crushed in\nbox cars, we were, I learned later, the most disheartening\nlot of ragmen they had seen in their more than\nthree years of imprisonment.  Responding in the tradition\nof trained British “ranks,” they radiated full responsibility,\nherding us to plank tables, scurrying\nabout like a choreographed swarm of caterers.  Their\nboots were polished and their worn tunics had all their\nbuttons.  These were the remnants of the defenders of\nTobruk, Tobruk in the North African desert, in the\nyear 1941, when the Allies were losing the war!  To me,\nthey were creatures from a lost planet, another world.\nThey served us tea in “Klim” tins, and a cracker each.\nThey indulged our incoherent questions and smiled\nreassurances.  They returned us to life.</p>\n<p>An impeccable, moustachioed Sergeant Major\nMacMahan, gaunt like all the others, wearing the beret\nand polished insignia of a Scots regiment, stood\nerect as a flagpole at one end of the barrack hut surveying\nit all, the angel in charge.  To his deputy, carefully\ndoling hot water from a canteen cup into a row of\nsmall tins, he snapped, “Mind the measuring now,\nthere's twenty-fxxxing-four to serve 'ere!”</p>\n<p>I heard it.  Whatever my state till then, I knew I\nwas not now hallucinating.  That was the first I had\never heard the word used as a “bridge.”  It was snapped\nout loud and clear, after the fashion of the proper\nBritish soldier, with none of the slurring so characteristic\nof the American using it as an adjective.  (Compare\n“y'r <em>fxn</em> well told” with “you're <em>fxxxing</em> well told, ole\nboy!”) I was in no condition to be charmed.  But impressed—I\nwas forever impressed.</p>\n<p>After a few days, befriended and coached by these\nveterans of a different time and a different kind of war,\nmost of us revived enough to make do behind the\nbarbed wire in the blighted landscape.  Assigned after\nsome weeks to a few hours per week in the makeshift\ndental clinic in the prison revier or hospital, I took to\nbusying myself during the great gaps of empty time by\nsearching out and putting on paper British army-language\nspecials, like <em>mucker</em> 'partner,' <em>scoff</em> 'overeat,'\n<em>fluff</em> 'girl,' <em>skilly</em> 'meal,' <em>griff</em> 'rumor,' <em>duff</em> 'dessert.'\nMost numerous and engaging by far were the novel (to\nme) uses of the ubiquitous, all purpose Anglo-American\nword <em>fxxx</em>.</p>\n<p>Hearing of my hobby, the prison “editor” paid a\nvisit.  With a willing little group of helpers he periodically\nput out the prison “newspaper.”  This was a wall\nposter containing innocuous camp news items, all\npainstakingly penned by hand.  A new issue was unveiled\nto a hungry readership about once every six\nmonths.  The suggestion by the editor, Eric Hurst, that\nI work up my lexicon on <em>fxxx</em> for the forthcoming issue\nwas a great boost.  I felt a sense of real purpose in\nmining for new specimens in conversations with these\nold “kriegies” (P.W.s) from almost everywhere in the\nworld where the King's and everyone else's English and\nAmerican were spoken.  I was also the beneficiary of\nspecial contributions from numbers of users and listeners\nwho had never previously felt the pull of scholarship.</p>\n<p>Reviewing our completed lexicon, Hurst and his\ncolleagues pronounced it a respectable body of work,\nacceptable for publication in the newspaper.  It never\nmade it, however.  Just one week later, elements\nof Marshal Konev's 1st Ukranian Army liberated the\ncamp and to our great joy, the world of the prison\nnewspaper ceased to exist for us.</p>\n<p>Though the manuscript remained out of sight yellowing\nin a footlocker for 43 years, the work was never\ncompletely out of mind, recalled on occasions when\nsome special item caught ear or eye.  For example,\nthere was the title of the popular British film of the\n1970s, with Dirk Bogarde, <em>I'm Allright, Jack</em> (see <em>Fuji-yama</em>,\nLexicon), and the name borne by a boutique in\ndowntown Philadelphia, “Sweet Fanny Adams” (see\n<em>Sweet Fxxx-all</em>, Lexicon).  Special mention should be\nmade of the fact that there are some items in this\nlexicon similar to those in the classic <em>Dictionary of\nSlang and Unconventional English</em>, by Eric Partridge\n(8th Edition, 1984), which first appeared in 1937.\nLuckily for the lofty sense of purpose which infused\nand inspired us, none of us knew of its existence then.\nExcept for the elimination of several redundant items,\nthis is the lexicon produced in 1945.</p>\n<p><em>Lexicon</em></p>\n<p><em>Fxxx</em> [<em>Anglo-American</em>]</p>\n<p><em>Noun.</em>  1.
