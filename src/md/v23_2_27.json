  "html": "<link rel=\"type\" href=\"ObiterDicta\"><h1 data-rel=\"title\">OBITER DICTA:  <em>Future to the Back</em></h1>\n<p><em>Judith Weiss Cohen, Pawtucket</em></p>\n<p>Whatever happened to the word <em>back</em>? I feel as if I have been transferred back to the future, or should I say “future to the back”? I look back to yesterday and ahead to tomorrow, but recently the meaning of <em>back</em> seems to have reversed behind my back. <em>Back</em> is often now used to mean 'forward.' Dictionaries show no such change. The adverb <em>back</em> still means 'in, to, or toward a past time,' and the adjective <em>back</em> is still defined as 'of a past date; not current'; but I continually find examples of backward writing.</p>\n<p>In an Associated Press story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Library of Congress put off a major exhibit on Sigmund Freud and promptly found itself on the couch.... The show was pushed back to late 1997 and possibly later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a <em>Providence Journal</em> story about a person considering a new job:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The 32-year-old father said he would do it only if he could push back the starting time until 11am instead of 9.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In one of thousands of articles about O. J. Simpson, in <em>The New York Times</em> Judge Ito was quoted as saying, in response to a request that the trial date be moved ahead, that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[I]t was too late to move the date back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reverse news from <em>The New Yorker</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>National Weather Service renewed its prediction for a 32.5 foot crest, but put it back another day, to Thursday. “It just kept coming at us like a bouncing ball.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A backward bouncing ball?</p>\n<p>From Larry McMurtrey's <em>Lonesome Dove</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He hurried to Santa Rosa, risking further damage to the wagon, only to discover that the hanging had been put back a week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More <em>Providence Journal</em> back talk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The hearing had been scheduled for Tuesday, then pushed back to Friday.</p>\n<p>Lawmakers pushed back from Feb. 1 to Nov. 1 the effective date of a law requiring all motorists to carry liability insurance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A possible theory for reversing the meaning of <em>back</em> is that the sense is 'further [back] in the schedule,' not 'further back in time'; but a usage such as the following in a published television schedule for 8pm may negate this argument:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking for <em>Roseanne</em>? You'll have to wait until 9:30. ABC pushed the program back 90 minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I sent pages of examples to the editors of New Edition of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>. They replied that my evidence</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...is filed for the attention of our new words editors. If they find that we have accumulated a number of examples of <em>back</em> in this sense in our files and on our databases then it will be considered for drafting as an established usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>",
