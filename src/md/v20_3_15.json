Writers would be well advised to read this book for, although it was probably far from the minds of the author and the publisher that it would ever be put to such (practical) use, Slotkin's work would prove very enlightening to the serious writer, aiding him not only in appreciating and fine-tuning his own technique but in alerting him to the various techniques a writer must employ to take advantage of all resources. It is consoling to learn that at least one of the stories, “Uncle Jake and the Bell-Handle” (1885), remained unpublished till 1969—though one hastens to add that it was written when Crane was only fourteen.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
