What makes the book so useful is\nthat with each classification are listed many examples from\nliterature.  Usually, a book of this kind lists only one or two\nexamples, and the listing of a half dozen or more not only\nserves the reader with useful information but aids the clarity\nof the description.</p>\n<p>How this book is going to help anyone “avoid triteness in\n[his] next club speech” I cannot say; I can say that the title\nand blurbs should be ignored.  Buy the book: it will add a\nuseful and interesting work to your library.</p>\n<p><em>L. U.</em></p>",
