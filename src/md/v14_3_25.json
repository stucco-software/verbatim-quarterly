But the book has a few\nproblems of its own.  In the brief section on Grammar,\nat the beginning, is the information, “Let me (him,\nher, it, us, them) hammer.”  That is the imperative of\n<em>let,</em> but I get the distinct feeling that the author has\npicked up <em>let</em> + <em>pronoun</em> + <em>verb infinitive</em> as an imperative\nconstruction in English because that is the\ncustomary way in which Latin, French, and other\nforeign-language (“true”) imperatives are normally\nrendered in English.  English has only one true imperative,\nwhich is the same form as the infinitive and, as\nRoberts states, would be just <em>Hammer!</em> (often spelt\nwith the exclamation mark).  The “let us” forms, in\nstrict analysis, are the imperative of <em>let</em> and only paraphrases\nof the infinitive following.  Further on, we find\nthat descriptive adjectives form their comparatives and\nsuperlatives either by adding <em>-er</em> and <em>-est</em> or by prefixing\n<em>more</em> and <em>most.</em>  But the latter is so only (and\nmainly) for adjectives of more than three syllables (in\nthe positive), and the examples, <em>more happy, most\nhappy</em> are not entirely idiomatic, <em>happier, happiest</em>\nbeing preferred.  Perhaps, because of <em>The Most Happy\nFellow,</em> song and musical, <em>happy</em> is a modern exception,\nbut most people would consider <em>more silly, most\nsilly</em> or <em>more dingy, most dingy</em> to be less idiomatic\nthan <em>sillier, silliest</em> or <em>dingier, dingiest.</em></p>\n<p>On into the alphabetic section, where we find,\nunder the entry for <em>adverse, averse,</em> the example, “She\nis adverse to your suggestion that the money should be\nborrowed.”  But is <em>adverse</em> idiomatically used of people?\nSounds awkward to me.  <em>Adverse winds</em> or <em>adverse\ncircumstances</em> sounds natural.  The entry for <em>affect,\neffect</em> ignores the noun <em>affect:</em> granted, it is somewhat\nspecialized, but these days people encounter words in\nthe strangest places, and terms from psychology (in\nparticular) tend to be bandied about indiscriminately.\nAt <em>affinity</em> we are told it is used with <em>between</em> or <em>with:</em>\nwhat happened to <em>for?</em>  At <em>amend, emend</em> we learn that\nthe former means 'improve,' the latter 'revise, correct':\nthe latter is right, the former wrong, as any American\ndealing with <em>amendments</em> to the Constitution—merely\naddenda or modifications in many cases—will testify;\nalso, who would say, “You had better try to amend\nyour manners, my boy,” which is the example given?</p>\n<p>By this point, we have reached only page 4 of the\nalphabetic entries, and it seems pointless to continue.\nA quick browse through other pages reveals, generally,\nthat the examples are more idiomatically appropriate\nto the level of the author of the book than to that of its\nuser, whom we might reasonably assume to be less\nsophisticated as well as less knowledgeable: “The unflappable\nhostess quietly apprised him of the state of\nhis trousers.”  “In contrast to his brother's altruistic\nbent, Perry's instinct for self-preservation shows true\negoism.”  “She eked out her diet of oats with apples and\nnew-laid eggs.”  “What does the posting offer in terms\nof living accommodation?”  “Most illiterates know only\na marginal standard of living.”  Et cetera.</p>\n<p>These idiomatic infelicities of American English\nmay pass muster in the region of Quebec (where the\nauthor grew up) or in Nova Scotia (where he spent his\nformative years), but they do not do so in this part of\nNew England.  In no event do we consider <em>preventive</em>\n(formed from <em>prevent</em> + -<em>ive</em>) to be interchangeable\nwith <em>preventative</em> (formed, presumably, from <em>preventate</em> + -<em>ive</em>).</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
