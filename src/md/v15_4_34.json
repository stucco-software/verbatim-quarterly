There is, however, no such Spanish\nword.  Rather, two explanations may be offered for\nthis English word.  My explanation is that English-speakers\nborrowed Spanish plural <em>tamales</em> (whose singular\nis <em>tamal</em>), from which they back-formed a new\nsingular, <em>tamale</em> (i.e., the division into morphemes in\nSpanish is <em>tamal-es</em> whereas English-speakers took it to\nbe <em>tamale-s</em>).  English has both <em>frijol</em> and <em>frijole</em>, the\nlatter of which may be explained in the same way:\nEnglish-speakers borrowed Spanish plural <em>frijoles</em>\n(whose singular is <em>frijol</em>), from which they back-formed\na new singular, <em>frijole</em> (again, the morpheme\ndivision in Spanish is <em>frijol-es</em> whereas certain English-speakers\ntook it to be <em>frijole-s</em>).  English <em>frijol</em>, on the\nother hand, is derived straightforwardly from the\nSpanish singular.</p>\n<p>A different explanation of <em>tamale</em> was offered in\n<em>American Speech</em> 48, 3-4, 1973, p. 292: “Just as the\nAmerican recalls that French words should be stressed\non the final syllable, he recalls, or thinks he recalls,\nthat all Spanish words should end with a vowel: <em>sombrero</em>,\n<em>señorita</em>, <em>noche</em> and so on.  These items are all in\nthe singular.  Thus, by analogy, many Americans make\n<em>tamale</em>, instead of the correct <em>tamal</em>, the singular of\n<em>tamales</em>....  By the same analogy, <em>equipal</em>, the splint\nand leather patio chair so popular in Mexico, becomes\n<em>equipale</em>....”</p>\n<p>The second explanation is possible, though numerous\nSpanish words end in a consonant and I don't\nknow how the two explanations could be verified.  The\nleast one may say is that no English dictionary published\nthrough 1987 gives a fully correct etymology for\n<em>tamale</em> or <em>frijol(e)</em>.</p>\n<p>An English noun which is definitely back-formed\nfrom a plural is <em>blints</em> (often misspelled “blintz”).  Yiddish\nhas (singular) <em>blintse</em>/ (plural) <em>blintses</em>, hence\n<em>blints</em> is an English innovation.  Interestingly, whereas\n<em>tamale</em> and <em>frijole</em> have acquired a nonetymological\nvowel, <em>blints</em> has lost an etymological vowel.  In general,\nback-formation of new singulars from plurals is a\nsign that the plural is textually more frequent than the\nsingular (indeed, the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> lists\nonly <em>frijoles</em> and no singular form whatsoever for\nEnglish).</p>\n<p>After the new singulars emerged in English, new\nplurals were formed.  Although English <em>tamales</em>, <em>frijoles</em>,\nand <em>blintses</em>, as now usually pronounced, appear\nto be derived from Spanish <em>tamales</em>, Spanish <em>frijoles</em>,\nand Yiddish <em>blintses</em>, they are actually innovations,\nformed in English by the addition of English <em>-s</em> (in the\nfirst two cases) or <em>-es</em> (in the third) to the innovative\nEnglish singulars.  This is proven by the fact that the\nEnglish plurals are pronounced with [z] and not, as in\nthe case of the Spanish and Yiddish plurals, with [s].\nThat is, since Spanish or Yiddish [s] &gt; English [z]\nwould be phonologically unlikely here, <em>-s</em> and <em>-es</em> in the\nEnglish plurals are the native English plural allomorphs\nrather than Spanish- or Yiddish-origin allomorphs.\nOnly among the few people who pronounce\nthe English plurals with [s] are these words derived\nfrom the plurals used in Spanish or Yiddish.  Generally,\nthese are people strongly influenced by one of these\ntwo languages.</p>\n<p>Brooke's derivation of <em>machete</em> from Spanish <em>macho</em>\n'male' is a folk etymology: the two words are unconnected\nand the correct etymology may be found on\npp. 746-750 of vol. 3 of Joan Corominas and José A.\nPascual's <em>Diccionario critico etimológico castellano e\nhispánico</em> (Madrid, Gredos, 1980).</p>\n<p><em>[David Gold, Haifa]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
