The word <em>ghost</em> has so many silly and\nlaughable connotations that this change was centuries overdue.\nAs always, this sensible change was balanced by the\nsudden idea that we have been misspelling for years the\nname of the man who built the Ark.  Now it is spelled <em>Noe</em>,\nnot <em>Noah</em>.  All I can conclude is that maybe the Church is\ntrying to convert over to Spanish.</p>\n<p>[<em>Jerry Mendel, Plainfield, New Jersey</em>].</p>\n<h2></h2>",
