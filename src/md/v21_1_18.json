Champlin, Jamestown, Rhode Island</em></p>\n<p>In his poem, <em>Birches</em>, Robert Frost describes a custom among country boys of climbing birch trees to the very crown, so high the tree can no longer support them but bends over submissively and lowers them to the ground. Frost calls this custom <em>swinging birches</em>, and the one who practises it, a <em>swinger of birches</em>. Though the custom was not universal, back in the days when youngsters still invented their own entertainments, enough of them swung the limber birches for it to be a common pastime. I even have found a Ukrainian native who remembered swinging birches.</p>\n<p>But being widespread, the game apparently earned other names depending on locality. In the rural Rhode Island towns of Foster and Glocester (Providence County) two other names for the pastime have surfaced. Asked if he had ever climbed the trees and let them return him to the earth, John Holdsworth of Foster exclaimed, “Oh, I've <em>swaled</em> hundreds of 'em.” Swaled? Another oldtimer, Henry Hawkins of Glocester likewise speaks of swaling birches, adding that it did not always work out as one hoped it would: sometimes the 15-20-foot gray birch would tip part way down only to falter, leaving the climber dangling halfway, a predicament, indeed. There is no going back.</p>\n<p>As a noun, <em>swale</em> rolls off the tongues of countrymen frequently enough, and means a 'tract of wet ground,' as in the geological term describing rolling prairies that have swells and swales. But <em>swale</em> as a verb harks back to English usage of an early age. The <em>OED2e</em> suggests Shropshire as the source of the verb, and it cites an 1863 quotation that bears out our meaning: “The great plumed hat flapped and swaled over my eyes.”</p>\n<p>As if that were not variation enough, another Glocester dweller, Walter Battey, refers to this custom as <em>swedging birches</em>. Swedge? I recognized the verb <em>swedge</em> as meaning 'bend or spread left and right the teeth of a handsaw that had become too straight through much use, and hence caused the saw to bind.' A tool called a <em>swedge</em> soon remedies this ailment. The term <em>swedging a birch</em> thus seems to have sprung from this bending action. Such are the imaginative borrowings of the English language. <em>OED2e</em> lists <em>swedge</em> as a variant of <em>swage</em> and suggests that <em>swage</em>, in turn, is an early form of <em>swag</em> a 'swaying or lurching motion.' In support, the dictionary offers this quotation dating circa 1530: “that the fruit may not ... disfigure the Tree by swagging it down with weight.”</p>\n<p>Do these obscure verbs, <em>swale, and swedge</em>, have a future? Only time will tell, or only as long as youngsters swing, swale, or swedge birches.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
