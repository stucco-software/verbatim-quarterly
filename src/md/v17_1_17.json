  "html": "<link rel=\"type\" href=\"Epistola\"><h1 data-rel=\"title\">EPISTOLA <span data-rel=\"contributor\">Norman R. Shapiro</span></h1>\n<p>Two items caught my eye in a recent number\n[XVI,2].  The first is Jonathan Bricklin's attribution to\none “Georges Louis” of the observation that “Style\nis the man himself” (p. 18).  Now, it may just be that\nsomeone by that name—a Frenchman, one would\ngather from the spelling “Georges”—uttered those\nwords or foreign equivalents thereof.  But I think it\nmore than likely that Mr. Bricklin is referring to the\nfamous French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclere,\ncount de Buffon, better known to literary history\nsimply as “Buffon.”  The oft-quoted citation is from\nthe <em>Discours sur le style</em>, his acceptance speech delivered\nbefore the Académie Françcaise on August\n25, 1753.  As here, it is usually wrenched a little out\nof context.  Buffon did not mean that man paints an\nautobiographical portrait by his style.  Rather, that of\nall the things an author might describe, all are extraneous\nto him except for his style, which is his alone,\nand hence his only possible passport to literary immortality:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>La quantité des connaissances, la singularité des\nfaits, la nouveauté même des découvertes, ne sont\npas de sûrs garants de l'immortalité....  Ces\nchoses sont hors de l'homme, le style est l'homme\nmême.</p>\n<p>[The number of things known, the curiosity of the\nfacts, the very novelty of the discoveries are no\ncertain guarantors of immortality....  These\nthings are outside of man, while style is man\nhimself.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second item, on a lighter note, is one of\nMichel P. Richard's homophonic epigrams: “I regret\nthat I have but one asterisk for my country” (p.22).\nIt reminded me of a little jingle that I read years ago\nin some college (alleged) humor magazine and\nwhich I rescue here from a well-earned oblivion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mary had a little plane\nIn which she used to frisk.\nNow wasn't she a silly girl\nHer little *!?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Norman R. Shapiro, Wesleyan University]</em></p>",
