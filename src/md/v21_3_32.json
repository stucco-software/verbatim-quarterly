Not many European-based toponyms in Africa fit in with the theme, but some that do would include <em>Brazzaville</em>, <em>Luderitz</em>, and <em>Pietermaritzburg</em>.</p>\n<p>In concluding, and with apologies to Robert Frost, it seems that Africans in the subequatorial part of the continent would have been attentive to the observation he might have made that, “Something there is that doesn't love a Z.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h1></h1>",
