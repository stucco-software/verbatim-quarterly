Rood, ed., (Facts On File, 1988), xi + 427pp.</p>\n<p>This is an interesting, useful reference book containing\ninformation about the better-known writers of\nAmerica.  It is divided into eighteen chapters varying\nin length, each dealing with a different aspect of the\nauthors and their works, among them,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writers Related to Writers<br>\nSchooldays (which colleges and universities spawned which writers)<br>\nAmerican Literary Pseudonyms<br>\nAmerican Literary Title Sources<br>\nLiterary Cons: Hoaxes, Frauds, and Plagiarism in American Literature<br>\nThe Profession of Authorship:</p>\n<p>Authors/Publishers/ Editors/Agents<br>\nThrown to the Wolves: Reviews and Reviewers</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography\nand a detailed Index.</p>\n<p>As can be seen from the chapter headings, some of\nthe material is trivial, but nonetheless interesting for\nthat.  It is not at once apparent why the book is styled\nan “almanac,” but that is unimportant: there is no\nother book I know of that contains as much diverse\ninformation about American writers as this one.  Its\nreadability and organization make it suitable for\nbrowsing—even for reading straight through—so in\nthat respect, at least, it does not resemble books in the\n“Oxford Companion” series.  It contains many photographs\nof writers, some quite early; these enliven the\nappearance of the book but accomplish little else, unless\none is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked\nlike at the age of 15 (as a printer's devil) or in the\nappearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle of a\nrailroad track in Cleveland in 1916.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to make any sensible connection between\nthe lives of authors and their creations.  A handful\nmight have led colorful existences, some are objects\nof interest because they died early, committed suicide,\nwere related to (other) famous people, and so forth;\nbut such information seldom reveals as much about\ntheir output as do the creations themselves, and in\ncertain cases one is probably better off not knowing\nquite so much.</p>\n<p>This book appears to have been diligently researched\nand has much to recommend it as an adjunct\nto most libraries, public and private, large and small,\ngeneral and specialized.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
