To be specific:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Scots English <em>Mac</em>- 'son of' is not derived from Gaulish <em>mapo</em> 'son' but from Gaelic <em>mac</em>, although both forms are from Proto-Celtic ?_ma(k)kwos_ 'son.'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>English <em>Druid</em> is not derived from Old Celtic ?_derwos_ 'true' but from Gallo-Latin <em>Druid</em>- 'Celtic priest,' which, in turn, probably comes from Proto-Celtic ?_dru-wid_- 'treeseer.' It is true that, at the Proto-Indo-European level, both ?_deru_- and ?_dru_- may be variants of a root ?_der_-, meaning 'strong' or the like, but it is as bizarre to call either derivative form ancestral to the other as to call an older sister \"ancestral\" to a younger.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the cases of <em>bard</em> and <em>bushel</em>, Crowley derives the English forms from Old Irish \"through\" Old Celtic in the former case and Gaulish in the latter.  Here, there are two problems.  First, it is hardly possible for any form to reach English from one foreign language by way of a second which is older than the first.  And second, it is improbable that all the English words listed by Crowley as having come from Irish or Gaulish actually did so.  In most cases, they must have come from Old Brythonic (the poorly attested language ancestral to Welsh, Cornish, and Breton). Since it was Britain that the Anglo-Saxons invaded, rather than Gaul or Ireland, any other assumption would be farfetched.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the cases of <em>bodkin, carpenter, Druid, vassal</em>, and <em>Cornwall</em>, Crowley confuses bases with words when he derives the English forms from Gaelic <em>biodach</em>, Old Celtic ?_carpentos_, Old Celtic ?_derwos_, Old Celtic [?]<em>vassos</em>, and Old Celtic ?_kornovjos_, respectively.  If we took him literally, the English forms ought to be ?_boddock_, ?_carpent_, ?_derrow_, ?_vass_, and ?_cornowy_ instead of what they are.  In each case, stem enlargement—of predominantly non-Celtic origin—has taken place, with the result that, in at least four of these cases, the resultant words are of mixed (Celtic and non-Celtic) origin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When he writes some of his Old Celtic words with <em>v</em> and others with <em>w</em>, Crowley implies that these are two separate phonemes, when in fact they are one.

Quite apart from the fact that few linguists now countenance the employment of such loaded words to describe sound change, I think that it is an open question which of the two forms in more \"corrupt.\"  For <em>Devon</em> does not in fact come from <em>Dumno</em>-.
