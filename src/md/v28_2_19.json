One of the worst parts of editing a small, unusual (not to say eccentric) magazine is reading the submissions to it.</p>\n<p>Lately, as VERBATIM comes (back) to the attention of more and more people, the number of submissions in both categories has been rising. A mention in <em>Poets Roundtable</em> has led to a massive influx of verse, much of it . . . inappropriate, but also given us one or two gems, which you will see soon. Notice of the magazine in other writers' periodicals has resulted in query letters, submissions, prison correspondence, and random pieces of suspicious mail, and also a few new subscribers. (Welcome!) I thought I would take this space to discuss, briefly, our editorial policy, so that the readers are not the last to know it.</p>\n<p>I am frequently asked how I choose what appears in VERBATIM. I refrain from answering “by Magic Eight Ball,” although I understand that it may sometimes appear as if that is, in fact, our editorial method. I look for articles that explain and illuminate without condescending; that are funny; that are moving; that are fascinating; that are less than 3,000 words; that are all of the above. I sometimes strong-arm learned professors into writing about their areas of expertise, and I accept unsolicited manuscripts from people with no academic credentials at all. I ask readers (in surveys and in private communications) what subjects interest them, and I search out that material.</p>\n<p>There are some Holy Grail articles that I would like to see, that in many cases I have asked for, and that have not yet come into my hands: an article on brain injury and language; an article on Verlan, the Pig Latin of French (or articles about invented languages and cants of other, non-English languages). An article on interesting features of African languages, contrasting real languages with the BwanaGreat-White-Hunter languages of the movies. Articles on the insider jargons of professions: best boys, dental hygienists, taxidermists, sous-chefs, prison wardens   Articles about bygone language theories. And there are many more on my wish list.</p>\n<p>If there are topics we haven't covered on <em>your</em> wish list, please send those ideas to me. If you want to see a particular person's byline in VERBATIM, send that in as well. In fact, suggestions of any kind are welcome (although there's a limit to the number of times we can act on “go soak your head!”) to any of our snail-mail or email addresses, or even by phone. Request away! I'll be here, reading.</p>\n<p>—<em>Erin McKean</em></p>",
