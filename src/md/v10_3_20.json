But in Japanese, the word given\nfor 'excuse me' is <em>moshi-moshi</em>, which is used almost exclusively\nfor 'hello' on the phone.  (To attract attention, try <em>shitsurei desu\nga</em> or <em>anone</em>; to apologize, <em>gomen nasai</em> or <em>sumimasen</em>—a\ndistinction Mr. Berlitz's list ignores.)  And if the author can\nbutterfinger one out of eight in Japanese, what is his average\nlikely to be for Thai, Hindustani, Turkish, or Polish?</p>\n<p>Indeed, of 36 pages indexed under “Japanese,” at least 15\ncontain errors—up to 7 per page; and though some may be\nmisprints, that is no help when the non-polyglot reader can't\ncatch them.  Mispronunciation abound, including an attempted\nlatrine-wall pun on <em>fuku</em> (really pronounced rather like English\n“hook”).  Still in Asia (to excerpt and spitlist running four pages\nsingle-spaced) the author confuses alphabets with syllabaries\n(115-117), misnames days of the week (105), misinterprets the\nChinese for <em>revolution</em> (260), and mis-romanizes Generalissimo\nChiang's name in <em>pinyin</em> (262); heading West, he ends Stalin's\nChristian name with a “p” (215), leaves the ICHTHYS acronym\nincomplete (250), and thinks Yiddish <em>schwanz</em> means simply\nand purely “tail” (179); at home, he derives Reno, Nevada,\nfrom the Spanish for—believe it or not—'reindeer' (166).  So\nmuch for common sense and standard sources!</p>\n<p>Outside languages as such, Mr. Berlitz sometimes displays\nmere ignorance, as when missing the point of “owls to Athens”\n(205) or characterizing the egregious Frederick the Great as a\nladies' man (249); more often he adopt Von Däniken's Method\n(if it makes good copy, print it and let documentation wait),\nresurrecting such pinchbeck oldies as the myth that “German\nalmost became the official language of the United States” (43)\nor the pedantic misdiagnosis of Cindrella's slipper as “really\nfur” (239).  Then there's the chapter entitled “There Were\nOthers Before Columbus,” which ransacks Amerind languages\nfrom Patagonia to Puget Sound for verbal similarities “proving”\nvisits here by everybody from Japanese through Sumerians to\nBerbers.  In previous works, Mr. Berlitz has employed such\narguments <em>ad ignorantiam</em> and <em>ad captandum</em> to promote belief\nin a lost antediluvian civilization centered on Atlantis; and his\nmethodology is worthy of his thesis.  As my 14-year-old points\nout, there are only so many sounds available; given wide\nenough vocabularies, you can prove relationships between and\nlanguages you like.</p>\n<p>Previous works by Mr. Berlitz fall into two groups: here,\nsuch straight pedagogy as <em>Spanish Step by Step</em>; there, such\nflights of fancy—really a single flight, continually, buoyed up by\nnew hot air—as <em>Doomsday 1999 A.D., Mysteries From Forgotten\nWorlds</em>, and <em>The Mystery of Altantis</em>.  The latter list is the place\nfor <em>Native Tongues</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[Gordon B. Chamberlain, Corvallis, Oregon]</em></p>",
