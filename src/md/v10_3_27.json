A ship is a <em>sea-wood</em> and a harp a\n<em>pleasure-wood</em>.  A warrior is called a <em>shield-bearer</em>, his sword a\n<em>battle-friend</em>, and war a <em>battle-play</em>.  The body is a <em>bone-house</em>\nor <em>flesh-clothing</em>.</p>\n<p>Some of the oldest words in English are disguised compounds,\nthe elements of which have been so closely welded\ntogether that they are no longer perceived as two-morpheme\nentities.  The word <em>daisy</em> was fashioned by speakers of Old\nEnglish from the poetical “day's eye.”  Few people today think\nof <em>daisy</em> as containing two parts, although Geoffrey Chaucer,\nwithout benefit of any etymological elbow book, guessed well\nwhen, in the Prologue to <em>The Legend of Good Women</em>, he\nreferred to the sun as “the dayesyē, or elles the yē [eye] of\nday.”</p>\n<p>Other words quite changed from their formerly compounded\nstate include <em>gospel</em> (originally gōdspel, 'good tidings'),\nhusband (<em>hūsbonda</em>, 'house dweller'), <em>sheriff</em> ('Shire-reeve'), and\n<em>answer</em> ('and swear').  “God be with you” has become <em>good-bye</em>,\nand <em>All-hallow-even</em> and <em>Cristes mæsse</em> (“Christ's mass”) have\nturned into <em>Halloween</em> and <em>Christmas</em>.</p>\n<p>When the spelling and pronunciation of compound elements\nchange, meaning often does, too.  <em>Holiday</em> comes from\n“holyday,” but many holidays, like Independence Day and\nLabor Day, are not holy.  A <em>bonfire</em>, earlier a “bone-fire,”\nseldom burns bones.  Even when the spelling is retained in both\nhalves, the pronunciation may change in such a way that it\nobscures the compound nature of the word.  How conscious are\nyou of the compound elements in the following words, and\nhow do you pronounce them?:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>atone</em><br>\n<em>background</em><br>\n<em>blackguard</em><br>\n<em>boatswain</em><br>\n<em>breakfast</em><br>\n<em>clapboard</em><br>\n<em>coxswain</em><br>\n<em>cupboard</em><br>\n<em>forecastle</em><br>\n<em>handkerchief</em><br>\n<em>necklace</em><br>\n<em>vineyard</em><br>\n<em>waistcoat</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Extensive borrowing from Latin, Greek, and French,\nlanguages that lack the compound-making enthusiasm of English,\nhas not halted the proliferation of compound words in our\ntongue.  We continue to yoke words together, especially in\nAmerica, from the early <em>backwoods, sourwood, butternut</em>, and\n<em>selectman</em> to the contemporary <em>pantyhose, waterbed</em>, and <em>software</em>.\nIn <em>The American Language</em>, H. L. Mencken points with\ngreat pride to our love of compound words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In them America exhibits its habit of achieving short\ncuts by bold combinations.  Why describe a gigantic\nrainstorm with the lame adjectives of every day?  Call\nit a <em>cloudburst</em> and immediately a vivid picture is\nconjured up.  <em>Roughneck</em> is more apposite and savory\nthan any English equivalent, and unmistakably American.\nThe same instinct for the terse, the vivid, and the\npicturesque appears in <em>boiled shirt, claim jumper, home\nstretch, comedown, bottom dollar, cold snap, crazy\nquilt, ticket scalper, prairie schooner</em>, and <em>flatboat</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How can we know for certain when two words have\nbecome a compound word?  How can we make precise distinctions\nbetween two separate words like <em>black bird</em> ('a bird that is\nblack') and <em>blackbird</em> ('a species of bird') or <em>hot dog</em> ('perspiring\ncanine') and <em>hot dog</em> ('frankfurter')?  One method is to listen for\nthe presence of contrasting stress, which, in almost all noun\ncompounds, means heavy forestress.  Say aloud the pairs of\nsentences below, noting how you distinguish in speech between\nthe two separate words and the compound words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Walking down the street, I saw a <em>hot dog</em>.\nWalking down the street, I ate a <em>hot dog</em>.</li>\n<li>Mary lives in a <em>white house</em>.\nThe President lives in the <em>White House</em>.</li>\n<li>I ride on <em>one horse</em>.\nI live in a <em>one-horse</em> town.</li>\n<li>He scolded the <em>dumb waiter</em>.\nHe loaded the <em>dumbwaiter</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the second sentence of each pair we see the three ways\nthat compound words may be written—open (<em>hot dog, White\nHouse</em>), hyphenated (<em>one-horse</em>), and solid (<em>dumbwaiter</em>).  But in\neach example the stress falls heavily on the first element, and\nthere is no pause between the two parts as we speak the word.\nThis contrasting stress pattern helps to emphasize the close\nconnection between the elements and often endows the whole\ncompound with a special meaning.</p>\n<p>A few more examples will serve to show how dramatically\nwords can change meaning when they are merged into compounds.\nWe all know what the color black looks like, but we\nseldom think twice about the fact that blackbirds, blackberries,\nand blackboards are not always black.  The blackbird hen is\nactually brown; blackberries are red before they are ripe; and,\nnowadays, many blackboards are green or some other color.\nSimilarly, fastfood eateries often dispense plastic “silverware,”\nhot dogs are cold in the refrigerator, the light can be on in a\ndarkroom, homework can be done at school, cupboards don't\nhave to contain cups or boards, and bathrooms often don't\nhave baths in them.  In fact, a bathroom isn't always a room,\nsince a dog can “go to the bathroom” under a tree.</p>\n<p>The characteristic stress pattern and the special meaning\nof compounds welds the parts together into units that cannot\nbe separated.  We can talk about a “dumb, clumsy waiter,” but\nwe cannot interpose a word between the elements in <em>dumb-waiter</em>.\nWe might see a “white country house,” but we cannot\ninsert a word in the middle of <em>White House</em>.  Further proof of\ninseparability in compounds is that we can say “a very hot\ndog,” where “very” modifies the one word “hot,” but we\ncannot say “a very hot dog,” where <em>hot dog</em> means a sausage.</p>\n<p>English compounds are amazingly versatile creatures that\ncan assume any grammatical function: noun (<em>earthquake</em>),\npronoun (<em>herself</em>), adjective (<em>colorblind</em>), adverb (<em>sometimes</em>),\nverb (<em>dryclean</em>), preposition (<em>without</em>), or conjunction (<em>whenever</em>).\nMoreover, almost any combination of the parts of speech\nmay be used to form a compound, although some are more\ncommon than others.  Focusing on the four major parts of\nspeech, the Noun-Adjective-Adverb-Verb matrix below illustrates\nthe diversity of compound formations in English:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>NOUN</th>\n<th>ADJECTIVE</th>\n<th>ADVERB</th>\n<th>VERB</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>NOUN</strong></td>\n<td><em>spaceship</em></td>\n<td><em>homesick</em></td>\n<td><em>flashback</em></td>\n<td><em>godsend</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADJECTIVE</strong></td>\n<td><em>madman</em></td>\n<td><em>bittersweet</em></td>\n<td><em>blackout</em></td>\n<td><em>freeload</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADVERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>upshot</em></td>\n<td><em>evergreen</em></td>\n<td><em>henceforth</em></td>\n<td><em>underplay</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>VERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>scarecrow</em></td>\n<td><em>fail-safe</em></td>\n<td><em>tumbledown</em></td>\n<td><em>hearsay</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Independent morphemes may marry in such ingenious\nways that the part of speech of a compound may be different\nfrom that of either of its components, as in the last two entries\nabove: <em>tumble</em> (verb) + <em>down</em> (adverb) = <em>tumbledown</em> (adjective);\n<em>hear</em> (verb) + <em>say</em> (verb) = <em>hearsay</em> (noun or adjective).\nThis happy state of affairs raises the question: can the third\ndimension of the four-by-four matrix be filled out so that each\nof the sixteen types functions as a noun, adjective, adverb, and\nverb, yielding a total of sixty-four entries?  Here is my response\nto that burning question, in the form of a four-by-four-by-four\nmatrix: *Even this matrix does not cover all the possible grammatical alliances.\nAdditional combinations include <em>into</em> (adv + adv = preposition),\n<em>whenever</em> (adv + adv = conjunction), <em>he-man</em> (pronoun + noun\n= noun), <em>each other</em> (pronoun + adj = pronoun), <em>himself</em> (pronoun + noun = pronoun), and <em>whoever</em> (pronoun + adv = pronoun).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>NOUN-NOUN</th>\n<th>NOUN-ADJ.</th>\n<th>NOUN-ADVERB</th>\n<th>NOUN-VERB</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>NOUN</strong></td>\n<td><em>spaceship</em></td>\n<td><em>bootblack</em></td>\n<td><em>flashback</em></td>\n<td><em>godsend</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADJECTIVE</strong></td>\n<td><em>shipshape</em></td>\n<td><em>homesick</em></td>\n<td><em>head-on</em></td>\n<td><em>handmade</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADVERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>sidesaddle</em></td>\n<td><em>knee-deep</em></td>\n<td><em>hands down</em></td>\n<td><em>shell-shocked</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>VERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>tiptoe</em></td>\n<td><em>court-martial</em></td>\n<td><em>zero in</em></td>\n<td><em>handpick</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>ADJ.-NOUN</th>\n<th>ADJ.-ADJ.</th>\n<th>ADJ-ADVERB</th>\n<th>ADJ.-VERB</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>NOUN</strong></td>\n<td><em>madman</em></td>\n<td><em>deaf-mute</em></td>\n<td><em>blackout</em></td>\n<td><em>slowpoke</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADJECTIVE</strong></td>\n<td><em>common-place</em></td>\n<td><em>bittersweet</em></td>\n<td><em>straight-forward</em></td>\n<td><em>rough hewn</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADVERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>barefoot</em></td>\n<td><em>northeast</em></td>\n<td><em>moreover</em></td>\n<td><em>roughshod</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>VERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>blackball</em></td>\n<td><em>high-low</em></td>\n<td><em>black in</em></td>\n<td><em>freeload</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>ADVERB-NOUN</th>\n<th>ADVERB-ADJ.</th>\n<th>ADVERB-ADVERB</th>\n<th>ADVERB-VERB</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>NOUN</strong></td>\n<td><em>upshot</em></td>\n<td><em>evergreen</em></td>\n<td><em>whereabouts</em></td>\n<td><em>downpour</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADJECTIVE</strong></td>\n<td><em>offhand</em></td>\n<td><em>overdue</em></td>\n<td><em>never-never</em></td>\n<td><em>income</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADVERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>overboard</em></td>\n<td><em>outright</em></td>\n<td><em>henceforth</em></td>\n<td><em>overmatched</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>VERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>outlaw</em></td>\n<td><em>outsmart</em></td>\n<td><em>fast forward</em></td>\n<td><em>underplay</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>VERB-NOUN</th>\n<th>VERB-ADJ.</th>\n<th>VERB-ADVERB</th>\n<th>VERB-VERB</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>NOUN</strong></td>\n<td><em>scarecrow</em></td>\n<td><em>speakeasy</em></td>\n<td><em>diehard</em></td>\n<td><em>hearsay</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADJECTIVE</strong></td>\n<td><em>breakneck</em></td>\n<td><em>fail-safe</em></td>\n<td><em>tumble-down</em></td>\n<td><em>slapdash</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ADVERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>makeshift</em></td>\n<td><em>punch-drunk</em></td>\n<td><em>worn out</em></td>\n<td><em>straddle mount</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>VERB</strong></td>\n<td><em>pickpocket</em></td>\n<td><em>blow dry</em></td>\n<td><em>give up</em></td>\n<td><em>make believe</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Most of the items above are self-explanatory, but some\nrequire a brief exegesis.  <em>Shell-shocked</em> (n + v = adv), <em>over-matched</em>\n(adv + v = adv), <em>punchdrunk</em> (v + adj = adv), and\n<em>worn out</em> (v + adv = adv) can function adverbially in\nsentences like “He staggered from the ring shell-shocked,\novermatched, punchdrunk, and worn out.”  <em>High-low</em> and <em>fast\nforward</em> are recent but well-entrenched compounds in English;\none who leads first the high and then the low card of a two-card\nsuit in bridge <em>high-lows</em>; one who presses the cue button\non a tape or video recorder <em>fast forwards</em>.</p>\n<p>The shiny newness of compounds like <em>high-low, fast\nforward</em>, and <em>blow dry</em> (the only examples I could think of for\ntheir respective slots) indicates the experimental vigor of\ntwentieth-century English.  I sense a massive, collective consciousness\namong English speakers, who, it seems, would not\nbe satisfied until the language evolved to the point where all\nsixty-four slots in the matrix could be filled.</p>",
