Although it is not impossible to\nfind a subjunctive in British writing of today, it is\nbecoming increasingly difficult; indeed, in a book I\nrecently completed for Oxford University Press, virtually\nall subjunctives were replaced by indicatives\n(which, because of the solecisms created in American\nEnglish, occasioned my rewriting of the text to\navoid the problem).  British writers (among whom I\nnumber journalists, who, after all, probably write\nmore English than most people) sometimes go to\ngreat lengths to avoid using the subjunctive, resulting\nin writing that jars what poor sensibilities might\nremain to Americans:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...[S]he cancelled all his interviews after two\ndays and insisted he flew home... Cape dared\nsuggest he travelled by train.  [From “Books,”\n<em>The Sunday Times</em>, 28 October 90:8:9.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not impossible to say, but it means 'She\ninsisted that he had already flown home [though it\nis unlikely that he had].'  “She insisted that he fly\nhome” means 'She wanted him to fly home,' though\nwhether he actually did or not would be revealed in\na later chapter.  <em>Cape dared suggest he travelled by\ntrain</em> conjures up an image of Cape (“his” publisher)\nhaving the effrontery to put forward the theory that\nthe absent “he” absconded by rail.  Had the subjunctive\nbeen invoked, these mysterious motives\nwould have vanished in a trice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because we were an alien family, dad and mum\nwere very keen that we learnt how to compose\nourselves in this new society.  [From an article by\nMagnus Magnusson in “Saturday Review,”  <em>The\nTimes</em>, 20 October 90:70.]</p>\n<p>We advise that the above items are not used\nuntil the retailer or the company has been contacted.\n[Customer Safety Warning Advt. by\nLeisuretime Products Ltd, Sundial House, 89-93\nGoldsworth Road, Woking, Surrey GU21 1LT, in\n<em>The Sunday Times</em>, 29 May 1988, B2.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The practice is neither consistent nor universal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It failed to be manufactured because she insisted\nit be made in Britain...  [From an article\nby Joseph Connolly, <em>The Times</em>, 7 November\n90:19]</p>\n<p>Someone on the Isle of Wight complains that\nyou couldn't get the children off to bed if it were\nstill light at midnight,...  [From the op-ed column,\n“...and moreover,” <em>The Times</em>, 29 October\n90:12.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although it has nothing to do with subjunctives,\nI cannot resist the temptation to reproduce the following\nsentence from an article by Sir Roy Strong,\npresumed aesthete and literatus, yet evidently victim\nof the universal virus that afflicts many users of\nEnglish when they scent the proximity of <em>like</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The paper used to smell in the same way that\nbooks from Eastern Europe still do today.  [From\nthe “Saturday Review,”  <em>The Times</em>, 13 October\n90.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whatever consolation it might afford Americans,\nthe British are with them in their ignorance of\nthe difference between <em>fewer</em> and <em>less:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maher points out that his Dillons flagship in\nGower Street carries no less than 250,000 titles\nand his other bookshops average 25,000.  [From\n“Books,” <em>The Sunday Times</em>, 21 October 90:8:9.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And some have trouble with the sequence of\ntenses (not a trivial problem, I admit), yielding in\nthis instance what might be called the “son-for-a-day”\nsyndrome:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I now know them to have been Mr and Mrs\nPowrie-Smith, and a chap I take to have been\ntheir son.  [From the op-ed column, “...and\nmoreover,” by Matthew Parris, <em>The Times</em>, 27\nOctober 90:12.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>",
