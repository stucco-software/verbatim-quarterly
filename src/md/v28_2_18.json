I was especially glad to see “Up to” challenged in the Summer number. That has long been one of my favorite objects of derision. Quite a number of years ago I was asked by a publisher to review a manuscript for a wildflower book, and one of my major criticisms was the author's use of phrases like “Up to 3 feet or more” (for the height of a plant)—which, I pointed out, covered everything from zero to infinity. Just this past summer our state automobile club magazine published a “Correction,” stating that in promoting one of its products it had declared, “Save 50 percent or more . . .”. The alleged correction? “Save up to 50 percent or more . . . ”. As I pointed out in a letter (unacknowledged, of course) it would be simpler just to say “Save something.” “Up to” by itself simply means [nearly] “less than” or “no more than.” It is more a warning than a major promise!</p>\n<p>Overdoing the arithmetic is also illustrated by the slogan of a local supermarket many years ago: “No one packs more in a bag for less.” Apparently other stores could pack more in a bag for the same price, or perhaps the same groceries in a bag at less cost. Some time ago Toyota used a similar phrase in advertising, to the effect that no other car provided more features for less; in other words, some other car might offer the same features for less (or more features for the same price). Very strange admissions in advertising indeed!</p>\n<p>[<em>Edward G. Voss, Ann Arbor, Michigan</em>]</p>\n<h1></h1>",
