This is equally true of other areas where Celtic civilization used to flourish.  Remainders, in specific words, turns of phrase, and very commonly in place-names are common in France, southwest Germany, and to a lesser extent in N.

All Celtic languages still spoken (Irish and Scots Gaelic, Welsh and Breton) reckon in this manner: <em>two score, three score and ten</em>, etc.  In modern French only the four score (<em>quatrevingt</em>) has survived.  Oddly enough, reckoning is also done in this manner in the Basque language, which is considered to be unrelated to any other known language.  I am not aware of such usage in German, although, especially in the Bavarian dialect, Celtic survivals are alive and well, such as in the word <em>Trumm</em> (cf. Scots Gaelic <em>truime</em>) 'an unusually large and ponderous object' or 'a very sturdily built man.'  But in S. Germany the 'half-a-hundred' as an alternative to 'two-score-and-ten' has survived.</p>\n<p>The Old-Irish <em>carpat</em> 'carpenter' must be a loanword derived from the Latin <em>carpentum</em>, 'wagon' or 'chariot,' first used in Augustan times.  Hence came <em>carpentarius</em>, initially used as an adjective (Pliny) and still later as 'a maker of carriages.'  Celtic words for 'carpenter' differ widely.  The oldest may be <em>saor</em>, an undifferentiated 'universally skilled artificer,' 'companion of kings,' and sometimes 'god.'</p>\n<p>An interesting aspect of <em>cateran</em> (Scots Gael. <em>ceathairne</em>) is its connection with the number four, i.e. 'fourth estate,' Celtic society had three classes with defined status and privileges: the king, the nobles, and the freemen.  At the bottom of the pyramid were the landless peasants, tinkers, jugglers, etc.  Though they did not have rights that were spelled out, there was the possibility of “upward mobility.”  The term did not become one of scorn until relatively recent history, when political and economic upheavals drove some of the Scots into rebellious acts and brigandage.</p>\n<p>On “Irish Bulls” [VERBATIM II, 1, 1] and the German bull, by an odd coincidence of assonance, the German word for this linguistic extravagance is <em>Verbalhornen</em>.  Dictionaries usually translate this as 'to bowdlerize.'  This is incorrect, inasmuch as the worthy Rev. Bowdler won his fame by presenting the world with a “cleaned up” version of Shakespeare.  Johann Balhorn, a German printer who died at Luebeck c. 1574, took liberties with the works he printed, but his thrust was to heighten the impact and elegance, rather than the elevation of the moral tone.  Collections of fables, very popular in his days, traditionally had a picture of a rooster on the last page.  Balhorn is credited with an edition in which the rooster had no spurs, but proudly stood beside a basket filled with eggs.</p>\n<p>The exercise in futility of “going from Pontius to Pilate” is an example of “German bull.”\n[John J.
