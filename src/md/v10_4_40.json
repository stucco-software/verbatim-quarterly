Now I'm gonna to Houston.”  The sales\nmanager delayed his note, and the next day there was\nanother brief letter from the illiterate salesman, as follows:\n“I got an order for halfa million from this Houston cumpny.\nI couldove sole them the moon.”  Delighted, the sales\nmanager made his way to the president's office and showed\nhim the messages and the orders.  The next day, the\nfollowing note from the prexy appeared on the bulletin\nboard in the sales office, along with the communications\nfrom the salesman.  The president's letter read: “We ben\nspendin to much time tryin to spel instead uv tryin to sel.\nLet's keep an eye on dem sails.
