Pub. in US as the Arcade Dictionary of Word Origins by Arcade Publishers (div. of Little, Brown), 1991), viii (unnumbered) + 583pp.</p>\n<p>Although one might be led to believe that all\ndictionaries of etymology are alike, the truth is that\nthey differ in a number of respects, and it is useful\nfor those interested in language to have several\ntypes available.  The <em>OED</em>, for example, has very\nlong and elaborate etymologies, some of which\nmight have been superseded (presumably in\n<em>OED2e</em>), which means you have to have the latest\nedition.  Then, too, the <em>OED</em> does not always transliterate\nforeign scripts, which might put those who\ncannot read Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic, Thai, etc., at a\ndisadvantage when examining cognates or loanwords.\nSome of the smaller dictionaries, from the\n<em>MW-III</em> and the <em>Random House Unabridged</em> on down\nthrough the college and desk sizes, contain etymologies\nreflecting up-to-date scholarship but these\nworks may not be particularly user-friendly: after all,\nsurveys have shown that etymological information is\nthat least frequently sought by dictionary users, so it\nill behooves publishers to devote a great deal of expensive\nspace to it.  In contrast to these standard\nworks, John Ayto has compiled a very commendable,\nuser-friendly book which is eminently readable\n(as is all of Ayto's writing).</p>\n<p>I do have a few reservations—(naturally!  How\ncould a reader identify an Urdang review if it did not\nhave reservations?)  First, I found the system of cross\nreferences inconsistent.  In the front matter we are\ntold that if “a related word is mentioned but no date\nis shown for it,...the word has its own article....”\nThat is not consistently the case, though it would be\ntoo boring to cite examples.  Second, (in the entry\nfor <em>albatross</em>), Alcatraz ought to have been identified\nas the “former” prison-island (it is still an island, of\ncourse), and the generalization that <em>ail</em> is “virtually\nobsolete except in the metaphorical use of its present\nparticipial adjective <em>ailing</em>....” fails to take account\nof the common expression, <em>What ails you/\nhim/her/it/them?,</em> and fails to explain what is metaphorical\nabout <em>She is ailing</em>.  Third—though here\nwe might not be dealing with Ayto's decision as\nmuch as the publisher's—it is simply not convenient\nto have a dictionary of etymology that excludes all\nbound prefixes and suffixes, though these are\nglossed, as required, when they are part of an entry.\nFourth, I think it a mistake to merge under one\nheadword words of distinctly different provenances\n(that is, homographs), as in <em>gloss</em>.  And, finally, there\nare far too many typographical errors for a book of\nthis sort: under <em>absent</em>: “4nt”; <em>after:</em> “millenium”;\n<em>loo:</em> “existance.”</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, there are many cogent observations,\namong them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>glitz</em>... “Its fortuitous resemblance to a blend of\n<em>glamour</em> and <em>Ritz</em> contributes to its expressiveness.”</p>\n<p><em>glass</em> [The entire entry is a gem.]</p>\n<p><em>know</em> [A well-constructed short essay on its cognates.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The chief virtue of the book is that it presents a\ngreat deal of information about word origins in\nhighly readable form.  Indeed, there is so much information\nburied in the entries that the publisher\nwould have been well advised to prepare an index to\nafford users better access to the nether reaches of\nthe language.  Perhaps in a second edition...?</p>\n<p>People often think that—at least by now—all\nthe words in the language have been successfully\nand accurately etymologized.  While that is true\nabout the majority of words, it does not obtain for all\nthe words and certainly not for many of the colorful\nparts of the language, notably slang and idiomatic\nexpressions.  For those words of doubtful origin (like\n<em>dive</em> 'disreputable bar,' <em>jingo, rag</em> 'taunt,' <em>toy</em>, etc.),\nAyto presents the current wisdom, where available,\nand lets the user decide for himself from among the\ntheories proffered.</p>\n<p>For those seeking a well-written, up-to-date,\netymological dictionary that sets forth its information\nin understandable English and is not riddled\nwith the cryptic symbols and abbreviations found in\nthe more ponderous, scholarly works, the <em>Dictionary\nof Word Origins</em> would be a good choice.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
