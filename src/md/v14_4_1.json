In\nCalifornia, plates of this sort are more accurately\nknown as Environmental License Plates (ELPs), since\nthe proceeds from this program are used to fund environmental\nprojects such as wildlife parks.  California's\nELP program is the largest of its kind in the country;\nthe state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) lists\nmore than a million ELPs in its official compendium,\nmany of them reflecting the humor and punning talents\nof their creators.  Under the California program,\nvehicle owners may choose any combination of letters\nand numbers between two and seven characters in\nlength for their plates.  (Prior to 1977, the maximum\nnumber of characters allowed was six.)  The only restrictions\nare that the selections must not duplicate\npreviously issued plates or be offensive or misleading.\nPersonalized plates seem to reflect contemporary language\nand society.  For example, as the <em>Los Angeles\nTimes</em> reported on September 20, 1984, the most\nsought-after personalized plate in California in 1970\nwas PEACE.  In 1984, however, the most common\nrequests included GO FOR IT, IM A 10, and PORSCHE.</p>\n<p>In order to present names, descriptions, or sayings\nwithin the restricted format of a license plate, creators\nusually have to resort to some form of language reduction\nor wordplay.  Reduction in many cases employs\nprocesses parallel to those used in creating signage\n(e.g., <em>nite, lite, thru, Xing, laff</em>), classified advertisements\n(e.g., <em>dept mgr, ob/gyn</em>), or other reduced\nforms, such as the call letters of radio stations (e.g.,\nKLSX for <em>classics</em>.)  In many cases, understanding a\nplate is all but impossible without the help of certain\ncontextual cues.  For example, the point of BORN TAN is\nunderstandable only if one has happened to spot the\ndriver of the car, a black woman.  Similarly, understanding\nRGR8GRM may be easier if one has seen the\nolder woman driver (presumably, “our great gram”).\nMy friend, given only the above plate configuration as\na clue, suggested that the plate might belong to “Roger\n8-Gram,” a local drug pusher.  The place where one\nsees a plate may likewise help in interpreting it.  For\nexample, I glimpsed PERADOX in the parking lot of the\nUCLA Medical Center.  Given the location, I guessed\nthat the car might belong to a couple who are physicians.\nSimilarly, NATE PT spotted behind a convalescent\nhospital, connoted “physical therapist” for me, rather\nthan “part-time” or some other equally plausible, alternate\ninterpretation of PT.  Sometimes quite a bit of\nbackground information, as well as context, is necessary\nin order to interpret a reference.  For example, the\nplate NADER 1 (illustrated in <em>Life</em> magazine on November\n17, 1972) is understandable only if the reader\nknows that the make of car so described—a Corvair—was\nonce described as unsafe by consumer activist\nRalph Nader.</p>\n<p>Given all of the possibilities for license plate subject\nmatter, how do vehicle owners go about creating\ntheir personalized messages?  While most of their strategies\nby necessity involve contraction and abbreviation\nof forms (to fit into the six-or seven-character limitation),\nothers involve character substitutions or\nadditions to achieve the desired result.  ELP strategies\nappear to fall into one or more of the following categories.\nThe plates described below, unless otherwise\nidentified, are actual ELPs selected from the official\ncompendium published by the state of California.</p>\n<p>1.  Dropping vowels, particularly schwa and silent\n<em>e</em>.  This seems to be one of the strategies\nmost commonly used in ELP formation.  Sample\nplates include:</p>\n<p>APPLPI\nCAMBRDG<br>\nCHPMNK<br>\nEGR2RUN<br>\nIDESGNR\nJRNLST<br>\nJZPLAYR<br>\nLTLPAUL\nMTRL GUY<br>\nNAVGTOR<br>\nPARALGL<br>\nRDRUNNR</p>\n<p>2.  Dropping consonants.</p>\n<p>MRXIMNT (Mr. Excitement)\nMY MSTG3 (on a Mustang)\nPONIAC<br>\nSGLFILE<br>\nSKYSKPR<br>\nWYLFIRE</p>\n<p>3.  Using substitute characters rather than conventional\northography to represent perceived\nsounds.</p>\n<p>BEATLZ<br>\nDIDJA3\nEXSOLJA<br>\nFSHN BIZ<br>\nISUPOZE<br>\nJAGWAR<br>\nMYKAR<br>\nODOKTOR<br>\nSINTHIA\nSPSHULI</p>\n<p>4.  Substitution, addition, or deletion of characters\nto represent accent or dialect.</p>\n<p>4GWAMA\nHAHVAHD\nIMNACTA<br>\nIWUVYOU<br>\nOIRISHI<br>\nSHOYL B<br>\nWATEVAH</p>\n<p>5.  Repetition of characters to represent stress, intonation,\naccent, or pronunciation.  It is not\nclear, however, which of these plates reflect these\npurposes and which reflect merely their creators'\ninability to obtain a more traditional or closer\nspelling of a name or phrase.  Examples include:</p>\n<p>AAHOOGA\nBEEEEEP<br>\nBILEEE<br>\nBOOOOOM<br>\nBOOOOZE<br>\nEETALY<br>\nIMKOOOL\nOOOOGAH<br>\nRROWRR<br>\nRRRITA<br>\nSOOOLA<br>\nZOOOOOM</p>\n<p>6.  Combination of numerals and letters.  Some\nplate makers utilize alphanumeric forms, creating\nhybrid messages that could be written entirely\nin numeric or alphabetic characters.  Examples\ninclude:</p>\n<p>7.  Use of numerals and letters as homophones or\nnear homophones.</p>\n<p>a)  Simple: A homophone substitutes for a syllable\nor word:</p>\n<p>ADVIZ4U<br>\nBGOOD<br>\nBOYIDER\nCBIRDGO<br>\nCMY81GO<br>\nEZTOC\nODE4JOY<br>\nRDOG<br>\nT42ME4U\nT4U2NV<br>\nUBGD2ME</p>\n<p>Examples using Roman numerals include:</p>\n<p>IIGETHR<br>\nIIIWLR\nVIIHEVN</p>\n<p>In some cases, plates using such homophones are\nwonderfully ambiguous, such as the message\n2HIP MD.  Was this car a gift to an orthopedic\ndoctor or is this the self-description of a “too-hip”\nphysician?</p>\n<p>b)  Complex: The sound of a homophone, usually\na numeral, is incorporated into another, adjoining\nsound.</p>\n<p>A2TH4U<br>\nA2THMAN<br>\nCUL8RQT<br>\nDR4A2TH<br>\nH82BL8<br>\nICALQL8\nLB8OVEN\nNAVG8OR<br>\nOBFUSC8</p>\n<p>c)  Use of character repetition to achieve the\nvalue of the homophone + plural ending.  The\nrepetition of a character often signals a change\nin meaning from that of the character standing\nalone.  For example, Y would usually be taken as\na homophone for <em>why:</em> YY, however, would probably\nbe read as <em>wise.</em>  Similarly, EE might be used\nto represent <em>ease,</em> while TT might convey <em>tease.</em>\nExamples of plates utilizing this technique include:</p>\n<p>CBBB<br>\nDR4IIII<br>\nEXQQQME<br>\nIIIIBLU\nIMCRAAZ\nXUUUUME</p>\n<p>d) Homophonic characters are sometimes used to\nrepresent colloquial or reduced forms in English.</p>\n<p>4UNME1<br>\nADDMUP<br>\nILBCNU<br>\nIMNACTA<br>\nINDEYE<br>\nLOTZAFN<br>\nN2DRTS\nN4GETBL</p>\n<p>8.  Use of abbreviations, initializations, blends,\nacronyms, or symbols.</p>\n<p>a)  Many conventional abbreviations are commonly\nused:</p>\n<p>15MAR57<br>\n75BMW\nCOPYMGR<br>\nDEPTMGR<br>\nGV2UCLA<br>\nLAFD911<br>\nOBGYN2B<br>\nWWIACE</p>\n<p>b)  Nonstandard abbreviations include specialized\nterms from disciplines such as medicine (CAT\nSCAN, CODE3MD); chemistry—e.g., C2H5 (ethyl,\nperhaps a pun on the name <em>Ethel</em>), C2H5OH (ethanol),\nC3H8 (propane); and from the business\nworld (SASAIR, HJS GRFX, KSCVFM).  There is quite\na lot of overlap in abbreviated forms, leading to\npotential ambiguities.  MAC might refer to a Macintosh\ncomputer of Apple Computer, Inc., or to\na Big Mac hamburger at MacDonald's. IRA may\nrefer to an Individual Retirement Account or to\nthe Irish Republican Army.  CAT could indicate a\nradiological procedure or Salomon Brothers' certificates\nof accrual on Treasury securities.</p>\n<p>9.  Use of foreign words, phrases, abbreviations,\nacronyms, etc.  All of the processes outlined\nabove can be applied to non-English words and\nphrases as well as to English.  Furthermore,\ncomplete foreign words may occasionally be used\nto convey an idea or attitude that is not as readily\nserved by an English translation.  Examples of\nforeign plates include MAIS OUI, NOTABNY ('nota\nbene'), JOI VIVR ('joie de vivre'), 2CHE PAS ('ne\ntouches pas' = 'don't touch'), LA BEL V ('la belle\nvie'), BET NOIR ('bête noire'; seen on a black\ncar), and OISEAU '(bird').</p>\n<p>10.  Use of codes, ciphers, or other techniques for\nconveying private messages.  Occasionally, regardless\nof the linguistic processes selected by\nthe plate creator, the message is presented in\nsuch a way that it is hidden, or at least not\nreadily decipherable.  While this is true for some\nof the plates illustrated above, the encoding referred\nto here involves manipulating the order of\nthe characters in some fashion; the resulting\nform is unrelated to the expected phonological\nor other pattern.  One example of this process\nmay be seen in the plate for actor William Conrad,\nreading DARNOC, i.e., “Conrad” spelled\nbackwards (reported in <em>Newsweek,</em> March 31,\n1975).  This plate illustrates what is technically\nreferred to as a “transposition cipher,” one that\ndoes not change any letters of the original message.\nSimilarly, the plate ETSYBAY appears to be\nthe name <em>Betsy</em> rendered in pig Latin.  Presumably,\nmany other types of writing in cipher, employing\nboth alphabetical and numerical characters,\ncould be used to create ELPs.</p>\n<p>As I continue to explore the infinitely varied world\nof personalized plates,  I find that they seem to fall into\none or more of the categories outlined above.  However,\ngiven the human penchant for ever more novel forms of\ncreativity, it will undoubtedly be only a matter of time\nbefore someone, somewhere, comes up with a unique\nidentifier, created in a completely new and individual\nmanner.</p>",
