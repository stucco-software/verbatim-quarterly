Some Spanish examples follow, with their translations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>plato</em> 'dish' / <em>plata</em> 'silver'<br>\n<em>cigarro</em> 'cigar' / <em>cigarra</em> 'cicada'<br>\n<em>foco</em> 'focus' / <em>foca</em> 'seal'<br>\n<em>arrobo</em> 'rapture' / <em>arroba</em> 'a weight'<br>\n<em>Pinocho</em> 'Pinocchio' / <em>pinocha</em> 'pine needle'<br>\n<em>dicho</em> 'saying' / <em>dicha</em> 'happiness'<br>\n<em>tumba</em> 'tumble' / <em>tumba</em> 'tomb'<br>\n<em>libro</em> 'book' / <em>libra</em> 'pound'<br>\n<em>pértigo</em> 'carriage' / <em>pértiga</em> 'pole'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The less common masculine -<em>e</em> and -<em>on</em> endings are also well represented:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>velete</em> 'thin veil' / <em>veleta</em> 'weathercock'<br>\n<em>tirón</em> 'a pull' / <em>tirona</em> 'seine'<br>\n<em>tizón</em> 'brand' / <em>tizona</em> 'sword'<br>\n<em>volante</em> 'flywheel' / <em>volanta</em> 'carriage'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unlike the examples recorded by Professor Read—in most cases fanciful creations not to be found in any dictionary—Conjugal Oddities consist solely of current Spanish nouns.  Furthermore, none of the terms involved has its own opposite gender; thus <em>foco</em> 'focus' has no feminine of its  own, <em>rodilla</em> 'knee' has no masculine, and so on, a fact that adds piquancy to the game.  So far we have collected several dozen of these pairs, and thorough research would no doubt yield many more.</p>\n<p>Although the majority of masculine nouns in Italian end in -<em>o</em> and the feminine in -<em>a</em>, just as in Spanish, we found relatively few Conjugal Oddities in that language.</p>\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>fiato</em> 'breath' / <em>fiata</em> [obsolete] 'time'<br>\n<em>filo</em> 'thread' / <em>fila</em> 'row'<br>\n<em>lamio</em> 'dead' / <em>lamia</em> 'witch'<br>\n<em>latte</em> 'milk' / <em>latta</em> 'tin plate'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One reason for this scarcity may be that often two apparently unrelated Italian nouns reveal, on closer examination, an unsuspected kinship that disqualifies them.  For instance, <em>purgo</em> 'tank for rinsing wash' / <em>purga</em> 'cathartic.'</p>\n<p>French presents a different problem.  Whereas in Spanish and Italian one need change only the last letter of most masculine nouns into an -<em>a</em> to obtain their feminine equivalents, in French the change often requires the addition—or the substitution—of several letters: <em>blanc/blanche; maître/maîtresse; chauffeur/chauffeuse; puceau/pucelle; baveux/baveuse</em>.  In this connection it can be safely stated that the greater the variance in endings of the genders relative to each other, the lesser the chance of encountering unrelated pairs.  Hence, the dearth of French Conjugal Oddities.  Nevertheless, French is flexible enough to assure the hunter of paired, unrelated nouns such interesting finds as: <em>jaquet</em> 'jacksnipe' / <em>jaquette</em> 'jacket'; <em>mépris</em> 'contempt' /<em>méprise</em> 'mistake'; <em>culot</em> 'bottom' / <em>culotte</em> 'breeches'; <em>picot</em> 'splinter' / <em>picote</em> 'smallpox'; <em>minet</em> 'kitten' / <em>minette</em> 'hop trefoil.'</p>\n<p>Morphological changes stemming from different cultural backgrounds have given rise to the curious diversity we find today in Spanish, Italian, and French paired, unrelated nouns.  It would be most enlightening to learn whether other language groups have their own Conjugal Oddities.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
