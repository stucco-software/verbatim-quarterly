Occasionally a super-Lulu appears, as in the ad in the Wall Street Journal for a <em>frozen ethnic food manufacturer</em>.  Luluized groups are not uncommon: NASA has an <em>Energetic Particle Team</em>, and the governor of California can call on a <em>7-person mudslide advisory panel</em> (7-person mudslides are something like 4-person bobsleds, I assume).
