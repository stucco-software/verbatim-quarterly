What a\npleasure it is to report that John Wiltshire of Melbourne's\naccount of Samuel Johnson and the medical\naspects of his life is just the sort of exposition and\nanalysis that this reviewer once considered writing\nand that Wiltshire has done it better and on a\nbroader canvas.</p>\n<p>Wiltshire starts with a review of Johnson's own\nmedical history: juvenile scrofula, poor vision in one\neye, the famous “tics and gesticulations,” gout,\nasthma, a stroke with transient aphasia, and finally\n“dropsy” with death due to arteriosclerotic heart\ndisease with congestive failure.  Add to this an account\nof his recurrent attacks of melancholia, and\nthe patient is clearly revealed.  By his own statement\nJohnson was “a dabbler in physick,” and the reader\nis given a full account of Johnson's medical readings\nand how he assimilated his knowledge for purposes\nof self-medication.  Johnson's doctors—Bathurst,\nLawrence, Brocklesby, Heberden, and others—are\nnot neglected.</p>\n<p>In further chapters Wiltshire sets forth considerable\nuseful information about medicine in 18th\ncentury England, its theories, its mode of practice.\nJudicious use of primary sources and an aptitude for\na telling vignette combine to make these chapters\nuseful and intelligible to a reader unfamiliar with the\nperiod.  Wiltshire makes full use of Johnson's own\nwriting, especially the essays in <em>The Rambler</em> and\n<em>The Idler</em>, to analyze Johnson's frequent, almost habitual\nuse of medical ideas as metaphors.</p>\n<p>A well-shaped chapter deals with the astronomer\nin <em>Rasselas</em> as an example of the man of learning\nwhose actions are severely limited by a psychiatric\nproblem.  Unique in the annals of Johnsoniana is a\nfull treatment of Dr. Robert Levet, an unlicensed\npractitioner who was a valued member of Johnson's\npeculiar household, and Wiltshire's close reading of\nJohnson's elegy on Levet is welcome and commendable.\nThe monograph concludes with a chapter on\ntherapeutic friendship, dealing chiefly with Johnson's\nattempts to steer Boswell into a more sensible\nway of life and behavior.  These were only transiently\neffective because Boswell was less than candid\nto his mentor about his compulsive drinking and\nwhoring.</p>\n<p>Some minor cavils: Occasional paragraphs are\ndevoted to the exposition and dismissal of various\npseudo-psychoanalytic theories about Johnson's personality,\na waste of time and space because no Johnson\nscholar relies upon them.  Also, the exposition of\nmedical ideas about melancholia relies chiefly on the\ncontribution of William Battie; the two Scotsmen,\nWilliam Cullen and Robert Whytt, deserve equal\nbilling for their contributions toward mid-18th century\nideas on melancholia.  But on balance Wiltshire's\nbook is sound and sensible, a distinguished\ncontribution not only to Johnsonia but to the wider\nfield of eighteenth-century studies.</p>\n<p><em>[William B.
