Why not\n<em>English people</em>?</p>\n<p>(2)  Readers may be puzzled by Philip Howard's gloss of\nthe British English slangism <em>bottle</em>, namely 'spirits, chutzpah,\nguts, courage' (<em>English English</em>), since they are accustomed to\nthe second word as a designation of a negative quality.\nHowever, as a result of emulated polysemy, it has come, in\nEnglish, to denote a positive quality, too (see the explanation of\nJewish English <em>khutspe</em> on pp. 273-274 of “Words of Jewish\nOrigin in English Dictionaries: The Case of <em>farblondzhet</em>,”\n<em>American Speech</em> 39, 3, 1984, pp. 271-278).</p>\n<p>Howard was right to reject a “learned Hebrew exegesis\nfrom the Talmud by which the transliteration <em>bottel</em>, meaning\n'to make something useless or void', has moved into the slang\nof British low-life.”  Since there has been no direct connection\nbetween “British low-life” and the Talmud (or the Hebrew\nlanguage in any of its forms), there is a missing link (or links) in\nthis rejected etymology, namely the Yiddish adjective <em>botl</em>\n'void, invalid'.  However, since the English noun <em>bottle</em>\ndesignates something positive and the Yiddish adjective <em>botl</em>\nhas negative associations, the explanation is far-fetched and\nHoward correctly rejected it.</p>\n<p>(3)  I have not read VERBATIM IX, 1 and 3, but there is\nenough in Zellig Bach's letter in XI, 1 to prompt me to express\nsupport for his position (I had already pointed out the absurdity\nof treating Sholem-Aleykhem as given name plus family\nname in “On Quality in Translation: II,”  <em>Babel</em> 18, 4, 1972, pp.\n29-30).  In trying to find the best spelling for this pen name, we\ncan best proceed from the Yiddish greeting to the name.  The\nwriting of Yiddish in Latin letters was standardized by Yiddish\nlinguists in the 1940s and the Standardized Yiddish Romanization\n(as it is now called) is unequivocal with respect to the\nspelling of the greeting: <em>sholem-aleykhem</em>.  It so appears in Uriel\nWeinreich's Yiddish and English dictionary which Bach cites\n(and not <em>sholem-aleichem</em>, as he miscopies from this dictionary).\nWith respect to the pen name, the obvious solution is\nmerely to capitalize the greeting, hence <em>Sholem-Aleykhem</em> (the\nhyphen, as Bach hints, will prevent misinterpretation of this\nname as given name plus family name).  This spelling has been\nadopted, among other places, in Leonard Prager's <em>A Selective\nand Annotated Bibliography of Yiddish Literary and Linguistic\nPeriodicals and Miscellanies</em> and in the <em>Jewish Language\nReview.</em></p>\n<p>It is interesting that <em>Mark Twain</em> is sometimes so misinterpreted,\ntoo (“Twain, Mark” in bibliographies or “Twain's\nhumor,” etc.).  The fact that <em>Mark</em> is a common English given\nname encourages this misinterpretation.</p>\n<p><em>[David Gold, University of Haifa]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
