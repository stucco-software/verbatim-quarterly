During most of\nrecorded history, people have clung to the belief that\nthe left side is inferior to the right one.  Muslims are\neven exhorted never to extend the left hand for greeting\nbecause it is considered unclean (being used for\npurposes of personal hygiene).</p>\n<p>From a purely scientific point of view there is of\ncourse nothing to indicate that either side of a (more-or-less)\nsymmetrical body in nature is the better or\nmore favorable one, and one of the earliest refutations\nof such superstitious beliefs appeared, not unexpectedly,\nduring the Enlightenment, though it was not at\nfirst based on pure reason but on a theological argument.\nLeibniz observed that God could have chosen to\ncreate either right or left first.  As a mathematician, he\nwas naturally concerned with symmetry (the two sides\nof an equation must have the same value).  Another\nfamous and more recent mathematician, Herman\nWeyl, in quoting him, said that “Scientific thinking\nsides with Leibniz.  Mythical thinking has always taken\nthe contrary view, as is evinced by its usage of right\nand left as symbols for such polar opposites as good\nand evil.  You need only think of the double meaning of\nthe word <em>right</em> itself.”</p>\n<p>Yet, in another branch of science, namely in\nstereochemistry, the leftward direction does seem to\nindicate properties that are unfavorable (at least from\nthe point of view of human beings and other higher\nanimals), in that many <em>levo</em>- compounds are the active\nor benign forms of an organic compound, while the\n<em>dextro</em>- forms are inactive or toxic.  The exact opposite\nalso occurs, however, thus apparently confirming the\ngeneral scientific view of nature not distinguishing between\nleft and right, up or down, inside or out.  That\nwas also the accepted view of all physicists, expressed\nin the axiom of the Conservation of Parity, until about\nsome 30 years ago, when two physicists, Tsung-Dao\nLee and Chen Ning Yang, discovered that some nuclear\nparticles can and do “discern” as it were, between\nleft and right, and that they have a distinct preference\nfor the leftward turn.  As so often is the case, the subatomic\nworld is mirrored on the cosmic scale: astronomers\nhave found that a very much larger number of\ngalaxies spin leftward rather than in a clockwise direction.</p>\n<p>The ambivalence of beliefs, whether mythical or\nscientific, on left and right is aptly reflected in the\nterms used for the two directions in the world's languages,\nas a glance at the accompanying Table shows.\nThis Table shows the major families of languages with\ntheir principal members and their terms for <em>left, right</em>\n(direction) and <em>right</em> (as a synonym for, 'correct,\nproper').  Practically all languages have several terms\nfor the latter concept.  If that is the case and one of\nthem denotes also the right side, that term was chosen\nfor the 'right' = 'correct' column.  The use of the same\nword for the right-hand side and for 'correct, true,'\nand related concepts is by no means a linguistic universal,\nand does not hold true even for languages\nwhich belong to the same family or branch.  Thus, all\nGermanic languages use the same Indo-European (IE)\nroot<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-a1-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup> <em>reg</em> for the derivation of words indicating 'correct,\nproper,' and the Latin word for 'king,' <em>rex</em>, is also\nformed from the same root (hence, the notion of the\ndivine right of kings, and the legal principle “the king\ncan do no wrong”).  That root is, however, not used in\nthe three Scandinavian languages for the right side of\nthe body, nor are their words for 'left' related to those\nused in English, German, or Dutch.</p>\n<p>In the Romance languages, Latin <em>dexter</em> is at the\nroot of all words for the right side, and the words for\n'correct' are all derived from the same IE root as\ntheir German counterparts.  But some interesting developments\nhave taken place regarding the words for\nthe left side: the Latin <em>sinister</em> originally meant 'left'\nand also 'favorable'; only later on, under Greek influence,\ndid the word come to mean the exact opposite,\n'unfavorable,' and the left side or the left hand were\nconsidered to be those to be avoided lest something\nunlucky or untoward might happen.  Pliny used the\nword <em>sinisteritas</em> in the sense of 'awkward behavior'\nas opposed to <em>dexteritas</em> which meant to the Romans\nexactly what its modern English form means to us.  In\nFrench, <em>senestre</em> was in use until about the 15th century,\nwhen all of a sudden <em>gauche</em> became the word\nfor 'left'; yet even the most modern and comprehensive\nFrench dictionary cannot trace its etymology to\na definite source, which is shrouded in the mists of\nthe distant past: it probably had something to do\nwith being askew or turning aside.  In Spanish, <em>sinies-tro</em>\nwas used until the 12th century, e.g., in the epic\nof <em>El Cid</em>; thereafter, the Basque word for 'left,'\n<em>ezker</em>, began to be used throughout the realm of the\nVisigoths as <em>ezquierro</em>, later changed to the modern\n<em>izquierdo</em> and similar words in Portuguese, Catalan,\nGascon, and Provençal.  While Italian has retained\nthe <em>sinistro</em> of its direct ancestor, it also uses <em>manco</em>\nfor 'left hand,' derived from Latin <em>mancus</em> 'maimed,\ninfirm' (French <em>manqué</em> 'lost, defective' is from the\nsame Latin word), again based on the idea of the left\nhand being the weaker one.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>FAMILY</th>\n<th>LANGUAGE</th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th>'correct'</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Germanic</td>\n<td>English</td>\n<td>left</td>\n<td>right</td>\n<td>right</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>German</td>\n<td>links</td>\n<td>rechts</td>\n<td>richtig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Dutch</td>\n<td>links</td>\n<td>rechts</td>\n<td>recht</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Yiddish</td>\n<td>links</td>\n<td>rekhts</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Danish</td>\n<td>venstre</td>\n<td>hφjre</td>\n<td>rigtig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Norwegian</td>\n<td>venstre</td>\n<td>hφgre</td>\n<td>riktig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Swedish</td>\n<td>nster</td>\n<td>höger</td>\n<td>riktig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Icelandic</td>\n<td>vinstri</td>\n<td>haegri</td>\n<td>rétt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Italic</td>\n<td>Latin</td>\n<td>sinister</td>\n<td>dexter</td>\n<td>rectus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Italian</td>\n<td>sinistro</td>\n<td>destro</td>\n<td>retto</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>French</td>\n<td>gauche</td>\n<td>droit</td>\n<td>droit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Spanish</td>\n<td>izquierdo</td>\n<td>derecho</td>\n<td>recto</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Romance</td>\n<td>Portuguese</td>\n<td>esquerdo</td>\n<td>direito</td>\n<td>reto</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Catalan</td>\n<td>esquerre</td>\n<td>dret</td>\n<td>recte</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Romanian</td>\n<td>nga</td>\n<td>dreaptă</td>\n<td>drept</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Celtic</td>\n<td>Welsh</td>\n<td>aswy</td>\n<td>deheu</td>\n<td>cywir</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Irish</td>\n<td>ciotóg</td>\n<td>dheas</td>\n<td>ceart</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hellenic</td>\n<td>Greek</td>\n<td>aristeros</td>\n<td>dexios</td>\n<td>orthos</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Albanian</td>\n<td>majtë</td>\n<td>djathtë</td>\n<td>drejtë</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slavic</td>\n<td>Russian</td>\n<td>levyi</td>\n<td>pravyi</td>\n<td>pravyi</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Czech</td>\n<td>levo</td>\n<td>pravo</td>\n<td>pravý</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Polish</td>\n<td>lewy</td>\n<td>prawy</td>\n<td>prawy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Bulgarian</td>\n<td>liavo</td>\n<td>nadiasno</td>\n<td>pravilen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>SerboCroatian</td>\n<td>levo</td>\n<td>desno</td>\n<td>pravo</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Baltic</td>\n<td>Lithuanian</td>\n<td>denšinėn</td>\n<td>kairę</td>\n<td>teisingai</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Latvian</td>\n<td>kreisi</td>\n<td>labi</td>\n<td>pareizi</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Iranian</td>\n<td>Armenian</td>\n<td>tzakh</td>\n<td>atch</td>\n<td>ughigh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Farsi</td>\n<td>chap</td>\n<td>rast</td>\n<td>rast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Indic</td>\n<td>Sanskrit</td>\n<td>vāma</td>\n<td>dakshina</td>\n<td>shuddha</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Hindi</td>\n<td>bānyān</td>\n<td>dānyān</td>\n<td>thīka</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FinnoUgric</td>\n<td>Finnish</td>\n<td>vasemalla</td>\n<td>oikealla</td>\n<td>oikea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Estonian</td>\n<td>vasakul</td>\n<td>paremal</td>\n<td>otse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Hungarian</td>\n<td>bal</td>\n<td>jobb</td>\n<td>helyes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Turkic</td>\n<td>Turkish</td>\n<td>sol</td>\n<td>sağ</td>\n<td>doğru</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mongolian</td>\n<td>Mongolian</td>\n<td>dzüün</td>\n<td>barüün</td>\n<td>dzöw</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Chinese</td>\n<td>zu\\?\\</td>\n<td>yôu</td>\n<td>dui</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SinoTibetan</td>\n<td>Burmese</td>\n<td>be</td>\n<td>nya</td>\n<td>to-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Tibetan</td>\n<td>yöö</td>\n<td>yëë</td>\n<td>tsöö</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Thai</td>\n<td>paisai</td>\n<td>paiqua</td>\n<td>tūk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Japanese</td>\n<td>hidari</td>\n<td>migi</td>\n<td>tadachii</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Korean</td>\n<td>oenp'yon</td>\n<td>orunp'yon</td>\n<td>parunyon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Vietnames</td>\n<td>bên

Slavic languages show remarkable uniformity\nin their use of terms for 'right' and 'left,' all of which\nare based on the same roots and are practically interchangeable\nexcept for minor differences.  Most Asian\nand African languages as well as the two principal\nSemitic languages do not identify 'correct' with the\nright side, but surprisingly, Korean (a language probably\nnot related to any other known language or linguistic\nfamily) shows the same usage pattern as English.</p>\n<p>It is obvious that the compilation of the Table\ncould have been done only with the help of bilingual\ndictionaries and in some cases that of native speakers\nof a language.  Dictionary look-up proved to be unexpectedly\ndifficult.  Many dictionaries fail to indicate\nthe grammatical form of words, that is, whether the\nforeign term for <em>right</em> and <em>left</em> is an adjective, adverb,\nor noun, and whether there are differences between\nthese forms (in English there are none, but in inflected\nlanguages there may be, which is not always made\nclear by lexicographers).  In doing look-up, many times\nit was necessary to verify the correct meaning of a\nterm in an English-to-foreign dictionary by consulting\nalso a foreign-to-English one, especially when no context\nwas given in the former; conversely, some large\ndictionaries offer so many different shades of meaning,\nillustrated by phrases, that it becomes difficult for the\nuninitiated to grasp the meaning that would best express\nthe concept of right or left for the purposes of a\ncomparative table.  One is left to wonder how well\nbilingual dictionaries perform their intended task if it\nis difficult to figure out the correct term for such basic\nnotions as opposite directions.  For some of the less\nwell-known languages we resorted sometimes to the\ntypes of small dictionaries or glossaries prepared for\ntourists, on the assumption (both naive and mistaken,\nas it turned out) that a traveler looking for directions\non the street would need to know the words for right\nand left.  To our great astonishment, only very few of\nthese popular guides included what we were looking\nfor, while offering translations of phrases such as “This\ntablecloth is not clean” and similar inanities.</p>\n<p>The basic notions of right and left are not expressed\nin any consistent pattern by the world's languages.\nMany of them have the same terms for <em>right</em> in\nboth its English meanings.  Most languages have several\nwords expressing the concept of <em>right</em> in the sense of\n'correct,' one of which may also be the word for the\nright side of the body or the right hand.  Almost all\nlanguages have only one word for <em>left</em>, and many of\nthem derive that word from one that expresses weakness\nor has an ominous ring to it.  We shall let Oliver\nHerford have the last word on both right and left:.</p>\n<p>Ambidextrous: not letting your right hand\nknow who is holding your left hand.</p>\n<hr>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a1\">\n<p>From a phrase in James Joyce's <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, p. 384.26. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a> <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a1-2\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1-2\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩<sup>2</sup></a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",
