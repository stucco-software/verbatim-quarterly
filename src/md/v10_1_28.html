<p>Karen Elizabeth Gordon, (Ticknor &amp; Fields, 1983), 93pp.</p>
<p>The subtitle may be a bit arch, and one may be given to
wonder how only 13 marks of punctuation can possibly merit
coverage in about 84 pages, but the secret is that there are a lot
of attractive, amusing illustrations and the type is large.  The
book is, moreover, fun to read and is populated (in some of the
example sentences) by people who might be close relations of
those who populate <em>Wordsmanship</em>, by Claurène duGran:
Charmiane, Nobiscus Kahn (professor of Angst), Charlotte
Tingle (a sophomore), Saint Fracas, Lady Zipworth, et alii.
Books <em>(Om, Om on the Range)</em>, place names (the Nismer-East
Blagundia Express), and friendly nonsense abound.</p>
<p>All this helps to relieve the boredom of examples usually
encountered in such material.  For instance, in the brief treatise
on the comma, subsection dealing with introductory participial
or infinitive phrases, we find,</p>
<p><em>Menacingly bopping down the road, the thug consulted
his horoscope and decided to take the day off</em>.</p>
<p>Under “A question mark can turn a declarative or imperative
sentence into an interrogative one,” we find,</p>
<p><em>You don't mind playing croquet in the mud?</em></p>
<p>Mind you, this is not the <em>Chicago Style Manual</em>, but for many
the usually odd and often off-putting examples will serve as
useful mnemonic devices for recalling an arcane instruction.
The book has verve, panache, cachet: an ideal gift for a
perspiring writer, though the donor is likely to wish he'd kept it
for himself.</p>
