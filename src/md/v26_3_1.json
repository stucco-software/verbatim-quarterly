Its origin would then be crystal clear. In Hittite, <em>l¯a lu</em> means 'penis' and was obviously a baby word like Modern German <em>lulle(r)n</em> 'to piss' (Friedrich 1934: 210–11). When German children go potty, they go <em>lu-lu.</em> Old words about which nothing is known are often easier to etymologize than the equally impenetrable slang of our time. For example, if <em>nerd</em> were coined in Proto-Germanic, it would naturally fall into the components <em>n-er-d:</em> <em>n-,</em> the negation, <em>er-</em> the root of <em>erth¯o</em>  'earth', and the suffix <em>-d,</em> as in Old English (<em>ge)byr-d</em> 'offspring', derived from <em>beran</em> 'to bear (children)', so 'not of this earth'. Perhaps <em>loo</em> and <em>nerd</em> even existed in the days of asterisked forms (for loos and nerds certainly did) but have not come down to us. Such things are not inconceivable. As early as 1598, <em>punk</em> 'whore' was already known, and in 1603 the even more derogatory <em>punkling</em> turned up. Then <em>punk</em> reemerged in American English in the 1920's and burst into bloom a few decades ago. <em>Punk</em> may be one of many words with the root <em>p / b</em> + a vowel (+<em>n</em>) +<em>k / g,</em> etc. designating swollen objects, like <em>pig, Puck, bug,</em> etc.</p>\n<p>According to the <em>OED,</em> James Joyce was the first to use <em>loo,</em> but the example in <em>Ulysses</em> contains a pun and is not fully transparent. This typically British word was felt by most people who used it before the 1960s to be of recent coinage. Its origin has not been discovered. Every attempt to guess it now starts with retelling Allan S. C. Ross's 1974 article, in which a number of hypotheses on <em>loo</em> are discussed and rejected. There have been a few more publications: Nixon (1978), Hedberg (1980), Shapiro (1987), Cohen (1991), and Wescott (1991–92), not to mention passing remarks in all kinds of books. Cohen summarizes Ross's survey but does not come to any conclusions.</p>\n<p>The conjectures known at the moment are as follows: <em>loo</em> is from <em>ab-LU-tions;</em> from the sign <em>one</em> (that is, simply a vertical stroke) <em>-zero-zero</em> often seen on the doors of lavatories (zero signifies a toilet bowl or rather a hole in a primitive toilet); from the long-forgotten cry <em>gardyloo,</em> uttered when emptying a chamber pot out the window (from some French phrase like <em>gardez-vouz</em> <em>de l'eau</em>); from French <em>lieu d'aisance,</em> or <em>lieu</em> <em>à l'anglaise,</em> or simply <em>l'eau</em> 'water'; from the name of the French preacher Le Pere Bourdaloue (1632–1704); from dialectal <em>looard</em> 'leeward' (that is, from the part of a small boat where latrines were constructed); from <em>loo</em> = <em>lew</em> 'shelter'; and from a sporadic French joke: <em>water</em> (short for <em>water closet</em>) suggested <em>Waterloo,</em> and <em>loo</em> is all that is left of the joke. The <em>Waterloo</em> etymology is Ross's; Cohen prefers <em>loo &lt; looard.</em></p>\n<p>Derivations that are the result of intelligent guessing cannot be verified, and this is the main problem with them. To quote Ross (1974: 313) on <em>ablution</em>: “This word was (is?) used in the British Army to mean the building on a base which contains wash-places and lavatories. The difficulty here is twofold. First, there is no evidence at all that <em>loo</em> was originally an army word. Secondly, loo seems a very peculiar abbreviation of <em>ablutions.</em>” Even if <em>loo</em> were originally an army word and if we agreed that the stressed syllable can represent the entire word in slang, under what circumstances did it emerge? Perhaps <em>loo</em> = <em>Waterloo,</em> perhaps <em>loo</em> = <em>Lou</em> (we have <em>john,</em> the earlier word was <em>jakes,</em> and names like <em>Tante</em> <em>Meier,</em> <em>Tante</em> <em>Lotte</em> 'lavatory' are universal: see Katora 1961: 163; so why not <em>Lou</em>?), perhaps <em>loo</em> = <em>(doub)le u</em> (from <em>WC</em>); <em>dubby</em> from <em>doub(le u)</em> existed at one time. Some of these hypotheses are better, others are worse, but how can we choose the best one?</p>\n<p>I assume that <em>loo</em> emerged some time during WWI, when Joyce picked it up, and that despite its initial popularity at Oxford and Cambridge it was brought home by discharged British soldiers. Curiously enough, all over Europe words for “(public) toilet” sound rather similar: German <em>Klo &lt; Klosett,</em> French <em>lieu</em> for <em>lieu d'aisance,</em> Dutch <em>Plee</em> (on which see especially Van Haeringen 1968), lamely derived from French <em>petit cabinet</em> (<em>plee</em> has the doublet <em>pleti</em>); German <em>Lokus</em> 'lavatory' also begins with <em>lo-.</em> <em>Loo</em> may have been coined to parody some such word, perhaps under the influence of <em>ablutions,</em> perhaps in imitation of <em>lieu.</em> It may have caught the fancy of students who knew the Latin verbs <em>lui</em> and <em>ablui</em> 'to wash (off)' and associated them with flushing. Puns on Latin sometimes give rise to pseudolearned words that quickly enter into the standard vocabulary. Soldier humor may have been responsible for the coining of <em>loo,</em> while student humor contributed to its spread. A persuasive etymology of <em>loo</em> will be discovered only if someone succeeds in reconstructing the exact context in which this word was first used.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Cohen, Gerald. 1991. <em>Loo</em> 'Lavatory” — Compilation of Material but with No Sure Solution Yet.
