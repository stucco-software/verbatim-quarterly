In April 1996, a political advertisement on television used the word <em>legislator</em> when the context made clear that <em>legislature</em> was intended. That ad disappeared after a few days; I wish I could feel confident that its removal was caused by concern for the language. Again and again one hears local and national broadcasters according an extra syllable to past participles as if the words were back-formed from adverbs, e.g., “allegèd, assurèd, composèd, markèd, suffusèd, supposèd.” NBC News “anchor,” Tom Brokaw, who regularly says “bo'l” and “Clin'on,” recently introduced a report on “brust” cancer. A slip of the tongue, perhaps; but, during one memorable two-week period in 1994 beginning in Thanksgiving week and ending December 2, while reporting on Bihac, he came up with “Bihar,” “Bihak,” and “Bihash” before getting it right. Is that acceptable?</p>\n<p>BBC has its Pronunciation Unit which advises on usage and pronunciation. Australia has had its watchdog Standing Committee on Spoken English. Now we learn [ANTIPODEAN ENGLISH, XXII, 4] that <em>SCOSE</em> is being disbanded. I urge and advise its members to listen to US broadcasters for a week or two. Listen and reconsider your decision.</p>\n<p><em>[Mary M. Tius, Portland, Maine]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
