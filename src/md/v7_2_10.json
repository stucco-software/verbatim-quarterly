'Took a couple\nof trankos and went right out' was the reply. It was the\nword trankos that brought the flavour of Australia rushing\nback. It is what Sidney Baker (<em>The Australian Language</em>)\ncalls a hypocorism, a form ending in <em>-ie</em>, <em>-y</em>, or <em>-ey</em>, or\n(especially in Australia) <em>-o</em>, to make diminutives or pet\nforms. In England such forms are associated with children's\nlanguage (<em>nursie, potty</em>), but such forms are not always or\nin all languages childish. Latin developing into the modern\nRomance languages acquired many diminutives, and Russians,\nItalians, or Swiss Germans, as well as Australians, use\ndiminutives more freely than the English do.</p>\n<p>Potentially any word might take an <em>-ie</em> or <em>-o</em> or be\nshortened. It is difficult to generalize a separate meaning in\nAustralian English for each of the three possibilities.\nPerhaps <em>-ie</em> is more truly diminutive than <em>-o</em>, representing\nstandard English unstressed 'little' rather than similarly\nunstressed 'old,' so that if there were a word *<em>trankie</em> it\nwould be 'the little tranquillizer' while <em>tranko</em> is 'the old\ntranquillizer,' both expressing affection. A possible shortened\n*<em>trank</em> would mean much the same, perhaps emphasizing\nfamiliarity more than anything else.</p>\n<p>In fact *<em>trankie</em> and *<em>trank</em> do not to my knowledge exist,\nand I have encountered <em>tranko</em> only in this one instance.\nBut when hypocorisms become established they sometimes\nshow all these forms (<em>Com, Commie</em> and <em>Commo</em> all gain\nentry to the <em>Australian Pocket Oxford Dictionary</em> as colloquial\nvariants of <em>Communist</em>). But more often the <em>-ie</em> or <em>-o</em>\nform exists alone. <em>Schoolie</em> 'teacher,' <em>barbie</em> 'barbecue,'\n<em>brekkie</em> 'breakfast,' <em>greenie</em> 'large wave,' or <em>trannie</em> 'transistor\nradio' appear to have no <em>-o</em> variants. Neither does\n<em>Pommy</em> 'Englishman,' though the shortened <em>Pom</em> is common.\nSometimes one or another of two coexistent forms\nbecomes established in a set phrase as <em>Pommy bastard</em> but\n<em>whingeing Pom</em> 'English migrant who complains about\nAustralia.'</p>\n<p>The existence of one form rather than another appears\nto be unpredictable, a matter for the particularity of dictionaries\nrather than the generality of grammar books. A\nPresbyterian may appear as a <em>Presbo</em> or a <em>Pressie</em>, not, it\nseems, a *<em>Presbie</em> or *<em>Presso</em>. A member of the Salvation\nArmy may be a <em>Salvo</em> or a <em>Sallie</em> but not *<em>Salvie</em> or *<em>Sallo</em>.\nSome words have <em>-o</em> alone; <em>arvo</em> 'afternoon' and <em>nasho</em> 'national\nservice, compulsory military training' are examples of\nthis. Again we might take a perfectly good Scottish diminutive\n<em>chuckie</em> 'fowl' and abandon it in favour of the shorter\n<em>chook</em>. Sometimes there are regional variants, as Western\nVictorian <em>blockie</em> and South Australian <em>blacker</em> 'occupier of\nsmall fruit farm,' or <em>premie</em> 'premature baby,' which I\nalways heard as <em>prem</em> in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>There is an unpredictable element in pronunciation as\nwell. <em>Chrissie</em> 'Christmas' is pronounced with [s] but <em>possie</em>\n'(comfortable) position' with [z]. Similarly <em>Tassie</em> 'Tasmania'\nand <em>Brissie</em> 'Brisbane' have pronunciation with [z]. This\ncould suggest that these words are simply formed on the\nspoken full forms, which are pronounced with [z], but this\nwould not explain the [z] pronunciation in <em>Aussie</em>\n'Australia(n)' or * mossie* 'mosquito.'</p>\n<p>Besides phonetic and morphological arbitrariness, there\nis an unpredictable element in the semantics of hypocoristic\nforms, at least in Australia. A <em>clippie</em> is a female bus-conductor\nbut a <em>connie</em>, with otherwise the same meaning,\nneed not be female. The <em>-ie</em> termination often suggests\nendearment as in <em>coldie</em> 'bottle of cold beer' or <em>sickie</em> 'period\nof sick leave,' but it occurs in <em>blowie</em> 'blowfly' (as well as\n<em>mossie</em>). And if it occurs in <em>sickie</em>, why not in <em>compo</em>\n'(worker's) compensation'? There may be a phonetic explanation:\nit would have been difficult to pronounce an <em>-o</em>\ntermination in <em>chewie</em> 'chewing gum' for instance, and this\nmay explain the formation of <em>blowie</em>. Sometimes etymology\n(and even spelling) determines a form, as in <em>speedo, Abo,\nchoco</em> 'conscript' (from <em>chocolate soldier</em>), or <em>uni</em>\n'university.' Terms like <em>smoko</em> 'a break for a cup of tea' and\n<em>fleeco</em> 'one who picks up fleeces in a woolshed' arise from\ncalls such as 'Fleece oh!.'</p>\n<p>Why do manly Australians (for we are talking especially\nof male language in this) promote diminutives?\nPerhaps what all hypocoristic forms have in common is an\natmosphere of familiarity. They reduce things to size.\nViolet's father in Arnold Bennett's novel <em>Imperial Palace</em>\nreferred to the overpowering hotel of the title as the 'pally'\nin order to maintain his self-respect. So <em>nasho</em> and even the\nrather official <em>compo</em> and the early pejorative <em>reffo</em> 'refugee'\nshow a desire to acclimatize the unfamiliar, not to be impressed,\nto cut down tall poppies. But familiarity is also a\nwarm thing and to shorten place names—<em>Darlo</em> 'Darlington,'\n<em>Paddo</em> 'Paddington' (these two are Sydney suburbs) or\nthe <em>Gabba</em> 'Woolloongabba'—makes them sound like home.\nPerhaps we need hypocorisms in a new country.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
