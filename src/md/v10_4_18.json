However, the dominant figure is Grandfather Myron\nAdams, “born at the tag-end of the eighteenth century,” who\n“consciously affected its archaisms” (to charm and often baffle\nhis grandchildren).  Add to that a generous amount of the slang\ncurrent along the Erie Canal in the 1820s and beyond, and we\nhave a savory mixture of vocabularies.  The secret, as the saying\ngoes, may be in the blend.</p>\n<p>Not many of the book's colloquialisms can be found in\nH. L. Mencken's <em>The American Language</em>.  Quite a few do turn\nup in <em>Slang and Its Analogues</em> (1890-1904), compiled by J.S.\nFarmer and W. E. Henley.  And a number of the “archaisms”\nare explained in the Merriam-Webster <em>Third New International\n(NID3)</em>; in fact, the source given for some of the <em>NID3</em>\ndefinitions is none other than <em>Grandfather Stories</em>.  Most of this\nquaint and flavorsome talk can be at least generally understood\nfrom the context; but in some cases, fortunately, Grandfather\nAdams translates Erie Canalese and other arcane expressions.\nThe following selective glossary relies primarily upon the book\nitself rather than upon dictionaries.

One of the largest groups is made up of\nfamiliar-seeming words used in archaic or dialectal senses:\n<em>accosts, affording, ambition, avails, bunkum, composition, copious,\ncruel, cupidity, notorious, officious, and pompous.</em></p>\n<p>There is a rich vocabulary of insult, or expressions of\ndisdain: <em>ash-bucket apprentice, bouker, higgler, ingler,\nignorama, makebate, parmateer, redemptioner, scrawn, scrim-shanker,\ntheologaster</em>, and <em>wastethrift</em>.  And among terms of\nabuse listed on p. 248 we find <em>chatter like a clape, dummock,\nFederalist muckworm, poxy Democrat</em>, and <em>drop that forge bar.</em></p>\n<p>Still another category includes what might loosely be\ncalled medical terms: <em>anatomist, cad-wagon, cachexy, cataplasm,\ncholera sermon, resurrectioner</em>, and of course the <em>contagionist,\nmeteorastic</em>, and <em>telluric</em> schools of medicine.</p>\n<p>Certain words and phrases illuminate economic conditions\nand social attitudes during the youth and maturity of Grandfather\nAdams: the <em>almshouse auction, poormaster</em>, and <em>poor\nvendu</em>; the <em>ash-bucket apprentices</em> and <em>redemtioners</em>; the\nrejection of such outsiders as <em>foofoos</em> and <em>gyppos.</em></p>\n<p>If we are grateful to Myron Adams of 19th-century\nRochester, New York, for the piquant, redolent language of\n<em>Grandfather Stories</em>, we should feel even more indebted to the\nphonographic memory, discriminating ear, and literary art of\nhis admiring grandson, Samuel Hopkins Adams.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
