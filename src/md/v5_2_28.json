As a handy desk\nreference for legal secretaries, this book should prove useful,\nbut it must be understood that it does not take the place of a\nlaw dictionary.

The pickings are quite sparse\namong the listings, for the smallest synonym dictionary will\nprovide more.  But the discriminations, a series of brief essays\ndiscussing semantic clusters like <em>shy, bashful, coy, diffident,\nmodest</em>, or <em>help, aid, assist</em>, are useful.  Collective Nouns (<em>ex-\naltation of larks</em>, etc.), Collateral Adjectives (<em>ape, monkey:\nsimian</em>), Color Terms, and a list of “some of the major sciences\nor branches of technology” round out the book.</p>\n<p><em>The Written Word</em> is a chunky little book about the size\nof a Big Little Book but not as thick.  (<em>The Right Word</em> is the\nsame size; <em>The Legal Word Book</em> is 5½” × 8¼”.)  According to\nits cover blurb, it is “A concise, practical guide to writing, usage,\nand style.  Featuring a Usage Glossary based on the recommendations\nof <em>The American Heritage Dictionary's</em> unique\nUsage Panel, to help you use words correctly.”  I have mixed\nfeelings about blurbs that contain incomplete sentences beginning\nwith a participle, but very definite feelings about\n<em>AHD's</em> Usage Panel, which set descriptive linguistics back 150\nyears (virtually the Stone Age as far as the study of language is\nconcerned).</p>\n<p>This is not a very carefully done book.  In the first place, it\nlacks an index to the section on grammar; in the second, it\nmakes errors that range from recommending <em>Origins</em> (without\ngiving Partridge credit), an execrable choice, to misspelling\n<em>Chambers Biographical Dictionary</em> [sic].  Also, the <em>Book\nof Lists</em> is missing as are many other reference sources.  The information\ngiven in alphabetical order in the Usage section is\nstraightforward except where the phrase “not acceptable” appears:\nnot acceptable to whom?  to the Usage Panel?  On the\nother hand, the treatment of <em>finalize</em> seems to be free of any\nsuch taint.</p>\n<p>In general, these books suffer from the fact that their\nbroad subjects cannot be properly convered in the compass of\nso few pages (of such small size).  However, if the need is\nlimited it is easily fulfilled, and, as far as they go, these are\nadequate digests of useful information for the (very) casual\nuser of language.
