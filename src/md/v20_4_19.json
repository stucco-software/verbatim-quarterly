The use of <em>blanquillos</em> for <em>huevos</em> is common in Mexico City. (I suspect that this is a reaction to government's attempt to enforce sex education in the schools in the early thirties. The clergy was violently opposed, and any term which related to sex in any way was considered “sinful”). While one buys <em>blanquillos</em> by the dozen in supermarkets and by the kilo in the regular market, everyone orders <em>huevos rancheros</em> for breakfast, including the somewhat confused American lady tourist who blithely ordered “Un ranchero con dos huevos.”</p>\n<p>As one travels northwards to Mexico, <em>huevos</em> becomes the preferred term, and is generally used from Jalisco north. I don't know about usage in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>Actually, there are a number of words used in northern Mexico for which there are either euphemistic or variant terms in Mexico City, viz. <em>panocha—piloncillo, tomate—jitomate</em>. I can't resist recounting what happened to my father one time. He was familiar with the northern usage of <em>panocha</em> for a cone of raw sugar. In Mexico City the term refers to female private parts (fpp), so when he asked the stout woman vendor if she had any <em>panocha</em>, the woman angrily replied “Si tengo, pero no pa' Usted, cabrón!” Needless to say, my father was so abashed he didn't buy raw sugar under any name.</p>\n<p>When I was in the foreign service in South America, I noticed changes in word usage, some of which could be very embarrassing for the unwary. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Argentina Brazil Chile Mexico Peru</p>\n<p><em>avocado</em> <em>palta</em> <em>abacate</em> <em>palta</em> <em>aguacate</em> <em>palta</em></p>\n<p><em>caja 'box'</em> fpp<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a1\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup> — <em>box</em> <em>box</em> <em>box</em></p>\n<p><em>concha</em> fpp <em>ladle</em> fpp <em>shell</em> — 'shell'</p>\n<p><em>pico</em> 'peak' — mpp<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-a2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">2</a></sup> <em>peak</em> <em>peak</em></p>\n<p><em>pinga</em> 'cane — <em>pinga</em> — — mpp liquor'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On another matter, I very much enjoyed K. Narayana Chandran's charming folk etymology on the origin of the word <em>cashew</em>. Although India is the leading producer, the cashew nut (<em>Anacardium occidentale</em>) is of New World origin. Food critic Raymond Sokolov in his column “A Matter of Taste,” in an article entitled “A Serious Candy,” <em>Natural History</em>, August 1982, states “...the Brazilian origin is clear. Many of the world's vernacular names for the cashew descend from the Amazonian Tupi word <em>acajúr</em>, [the Dominican Republic's] <em>cajuil</em>, the Portuguese <em>cajú</em>, the English cashew.” The Portuguese introduced cashews to their colonies at Goa and Mozambique.</p>\n<p>[Ann Hopping, Fresno]</p>\n<hr>\n<h2></h2>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-a1\">\n<p>1fpp—female private parts <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-a2\">\n<p>mpp—male private parts <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a2\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 2\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",
