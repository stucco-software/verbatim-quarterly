Others\nin the series provide guides to French, Italian, German,\nMexican, and Latin American menus. Except for the French\none, which has (in the edition I have) 163 pages and costs\n$3.95, each of the others is priced at $2.95. I have had\nrecourse to the French edition and have found it quite\nuseful, though it must be pointed out that at about 33 dishes\nper page, such a work can scarcely exhaust all of the dishes\nin any national cuisine (except, perhaps, that of the United\nStates). “Ellison takes the fear out of foreign restaurants”\ngoes the blurb, evoking images of Milquetoasts quaking in\nterror before intimidating maîtres d'hôtel and scornful\nwaiters.</p>\n<p>All the basic dishes are here, each given an English\nequivalent or translation: you can easily avoid inadvertently\nordering <em>cabeza de ternasco asado</em> (roast baby lamb's head)\nor <em>cabeza de ternera</em> (roast boned veal head poached in\nbroth)-unless, of course, they strike your fancy. If you are\na gourmet, you may not be satisfied by a mere identification\nand should then go to a more comprehensive work that lists\ningredients and recipes. But for the casual gourmand, the\nMenu Readers should be sufficient and could be made more\nuseful only by printing them on gravy-proof paper. [Orders,\nenclosing payment in full and 30(1; additional for postage for\neach book, should be sent to Ellison Enterprises, 2951 S.\nBayshore Drive, Miami, FL 33133: Florida residents add\nsales tax.]</p>",
