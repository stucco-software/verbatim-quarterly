Still, we hear the term misused: an acronym is an abbreviation, but not all abbreviations are acronyms; that is, an acronym is a pronounceable sequence of letters (which might, but do not, necessarily, form a recognizable word) made up of the initial or beginning letters of a name or phrase. Thus, by my (admittedly arbitrary) standards, <em>ASAP</em> is not an acronym because it is customarily pronounced [ay ess ay pee] and not [ay sap]. <em>AWOL</em> is an anomalous example: if it stands for <em>Absent WithOut Leave</em>, then the <em>O</em> is hard to describe, for <em>without</em> is one word. Sometimes, acronyms are made up of parts of words, as in <em>Nabisco</em>, from <em>National Biscuit Company, radar</em>, from <em>ra</em>dio detecting <em>a</em>nd <em>r</em>anging, and scores of others. <em>Laser</em> is a “perfect” acronym, formed from <em>light a</em>mplification by <em>s</em>timulated <em>e</em>mission of <em>r</em>adiation—provided that it is agreed that “prepositions, articles, and other particles do not count.” Hauptman also cites <em>nimby</em> <em>'n</em>ot <em>in my back yard'</em> and <em>Wasp</em> 'white Anglo-Saxon <em>Pr</em>otestant.”</p>\n<p>However useful and important the interpretation of abbreviations, acronyms, and what have come to be classed as “word-initial elements” might be, they are amply covered in extensive works that have been published (and periodically supplemented and updated) by Gale Research Company. Such works are necessary, particularly to those who dabble in the nether reaches of research and have to understand references to <em>PMLA, TESOL</em>, and other arcana. Except for such practical purposes, the usefulness of a short book devoted to “the fascinating world of acronyms and abbreviations” lies beyond my ken and is about as exciting as learning that a hive of bees has been trained to hum “God Save the Queen.” In the pages of VERBATIM have appeared comments on acronyms: the word <em>acronymania</em> appears in “Prep School Slanguage,” by Richard Lederer [IX,4]: Spring, 1983], but I cannot say whether he coined it. More recently, comment has appeared in these pages—the exact reference eludes me at the moment—concerning <em>bacronyms</em>, that is the coining of a phrase or name solely in order to ensure its yielding a catchy, suitable acronym.
