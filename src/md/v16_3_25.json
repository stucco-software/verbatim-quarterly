He has also been sentenced to a concurrent\neight-year term for using the verb in an\nanachronistic context.</p>\n<p>Lucien Maître-Créche, a 48-year-old copywriter\nspecializing in fast-food accounts, was found\nguilty by a jury of eight men and four women of\ndeliberately using the imperfect subjunctive tense of\nthe franglaism <em>jumbo frankfurter</em> in a series of ads\nposted in the Paris Metro system.  <em>Jumbo Frankfurter</em>\nis a French corruption of the American expression\n<em>jumbo frankfurter</em>, and is used in French as a verb\nmeaning, literally, 'to eat a large hot dog.'</p>\n<p>The expression is one of several hundred that\nthe French government has forbidden in all official\ncommunications, as well as in all public advertising.\nLegal penalties vary according to the context in\nwhich the word is used, the gender (in the case of\nnouns), and the tense and mood (in the case of\nverbs).  Thus, while it is a misdemeanor to employ\nthe expression <em>jumbo frankfurter</em> in public discourse,\nto date only one person has been charged with the\noffense: a Libyan terrorist who asked for a large hot\ndog during his arraignment for blowing up an art\nmuseum in Dijon.  Maître-Créche, on the other\nhand, was charged with a felony, punishable by a\nmaximum prison sentence of 25 years, because the\nterm was not used in “the ephemeral, innocuous\ncontext of speech,” according to the prosecutor, but\nin the “semi-non-ephemeral, culturally reverberative\ncontext of advertising.”  He will begin serving\nhis sentence immediately.</p>\n<p>The cause of Maître-Créche's legal troubles was\na poster depicting Rabelais' famous comic figure\nGargantua staring forlornly at an empty hot-dog roll\nand sighing, “Que j'eusse bien aimé jumbo frankfurther\naujourd'hui!” ['Boy, I could have really gone\nfor a big hot dog today!']  Officials at the Ministry for\nCultural Recidivism, alarmed that the proliferation\nof the posters could create an unfortunate conception\nin the minds of French children that the imperfect\nsubjunctive tense of the verb <em>jumbo frankfurter</em>\ndated all the way back to Rabelaisian times—thus\nlending the expression a certain historical pedigree—immediately\nordered the copywriter's arrest.</p>\n<p>“Ce n'est pas une question de <em>jumbo frankfurter</em>\nou de ne pas <em>jumbo frankfurter</em>,” said Ministry Director\nGaston-Fenelon de la Rue Saugrenue.  “Ici, en\nFrance, n'importe qui a le droit de <em>jumbo frank-furter</em>.\nMais on n'a pas le droit d'apprendre aux enfants\nque, l'époque de Rabelais, les gens auraient\n<em>jumbo frankfurter</em>.  Pas de question, Pepe.”  [It's not a\nquestion of having a big hot dog or not having a big\nhot dog.  Here in France, anyone has the right to eat\na big hot dog.  But people do not have the right to\nteach our schoolchildren that back in the days of\nRabelais people ate big hot dogs.  No way, Jose.']</p>\n<p>Sources say that Maître-Créche's unusually stiff\nsentence resulted from a legal ploy that backfired.\nOnce it became obvious that the case was being lost,\nthe defendant's lawyer blamed the whole flap on a\nprinter's error, maintaining that his client's original\nad copy depicted Gargantua speaking in the future\ntense of the verb:  “Un de ces jours, on jumbo\nfrankfurtera dans les coins”  ['One of these days,\nfolks around here will be eating big hot dogs.']  The\nuse of the future tense carries a $12,000 fine, but no\nprison sentence.  But the printer denied the allegation,\nand as no copy of the mislaid print order was\never found, the jury decided that the copywriter had\nperjured himself.</p>\n<p>A last ditch defense effort to portray MaîtreCrèche\nas a peasant ignorant of France's tough laws\non the use of such expressions backfired when the\nprosecution unveiled a book found in the defendant's\noffice entitled 108 <em>Franglaish Expressions\nThat Can Get You Put in Jail If You Use Them In This\nCountry.  ['108 Expressions Franglaises Qui Pourraient\nVous Poser des Problè mes Judiciaires dans Ce\nPays.']</em></p>\n<p>Experts on French criminal syntax say that\nMaître-Crèche was lucky that he didn't use the future\nanterior tense, which is punishable by the guillotine.</p>",
