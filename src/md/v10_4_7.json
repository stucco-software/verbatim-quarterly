Available\nfor it are ten “modules” (programs) dealing with logic,\nwords, music, art, foods, geography, fractions, and the (I\nsuppose) inevitable arcade games.

Most of\nthe items offered are quite inexpensive, though how good they\nare I cannot say, as I haven't seen them “in the flesh.”  Creative\nPublications' address is P.O. Box 10328, Palo Alto, California\n94303.  The toll-free phone number (for orders) is 800-624-0822\n(800-321-0707 in California).  There are many beautiful full-color\nphotos of seashells throughout the catalogue.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
