Some of\nus have picked up a few taboo words or phrases from German\n<em>(scheissen)</em> or from French <em>(merde; je m'en fou)</em>—at least the\nterms that have a taboo translation in English—but for the most\npart we are unfamiliar with such terms in another language.</p>\n<p>It was interesting to read <em>Lexical Innovation: A Study of\nSlang, Colloquialisms and Casual Speech</em>, by Karl Sornig (John\nBenjamins North America, 1981), because it contains many\nwords and phrases from several Indo-European languages that\nare unlikely to be met with by most of us.  In the following\nparagraphs, I have drawn freely from materials in Sornig's\nbook—but for my own purposes in this article: the book itself\nuses the examples to illustrate a variety of sources of slang in\naccordance with the author's analysis of the “nether” reaches\nof the language, an analysis I shall only touch on here and\nthere.</p>\n<p>One interesting source of slang in (apparently) many\nlanguages is in borrowings.  This, in Austrian <em>jemandem eine\nPantschen</em> '[give] someone a blow,' <em>Pantschen</em> can be traced to\nEnglish <em>punch</em>.  German <em>Schickse</em> 'girl, prostitute' comes from\nYiddish <em>schickse</em> 'gentile girl.'  Austrian <em>tschinkwe</em> 'valueless,\nworthless' is from Italian <em>cinque</em> 'five,' while Italian <em>kitsh</em> 'trash'\nwas borrowed from German <em>Kitsch</em>, with the same meaning.\nTurkish <em>iskarta</em> 'refuse, rubbish' is from Italian <em>scartare</em> 'to\ndiscard, secrete,' and French <em>je m'en fou</em>, a mild translation of\nwhich is 'I don't give a damn,' ended up in Austrian as\n<em>schmafu</em> 'mean, stingy.'</p>\n<p>Not all borrowings ended up as corruptions of the original\nword or phrase: some were translated, as Italian <em>erba</em> 'herb'\n(which probably originated as a translated version of English\n<em>grass</em> 'marijuana') and Italian <em>cavallo</em> 'horse,' a “literal” translation\nof the English slang word for 'heroin.'</p>\n<p>Slang has always been with us.  Historically, French <em>tête</em>\n'head' is traced to Latin <em>testa</em> '(ceramic) pot.'</p>\n<p>A German slang term for 'money' is <em>Marie</em>, a loanword\nfrom Gypsy <em>maro</em> where it means 'bread,' a metaphoric\nextension familiar to speakers of contemporary English.  Theater\npeople know the expression <em>Break a leg!</em> meaning 'Good\nluck!,' but how many know its origin in German <em>jemandem\n(Hals- und) Beinbruch wünschen</em> 'wish someone would break\nhis (neck and) leg'?  In Hebrew and Yiddish, <em>broche</em> means\n'benediction' and <em>hazloche</em> means 'luck'; whether the expression\nis the result of an error or a pun is not clear.  Another\nexpression resulting from a loanword distortion is British\nEnglish <em>(That's) another pair of shoes</em>, with <em>shoes</em> a corruption\nof French <em>chose</em> 'thing,' <em>pair of</em> having been added as a joke.\nTurkish <em>sakal döken</em> 'those who dropped their beards' derived\nfrom French <em>Cercle d'Orient</em>, a club of pro-European, clean-shaven\nintellectuals in Istanbul in the 19th century.  Nor is the\nphenomenon of distorting loanwords a modern one; in fact,\nthere are indications that the process has diminished considerably\nsince the advent of printing and literacy.  Latin <em>lapathum</em>\nbecame French <em>patience</em> (the plant) by false analogy of <em>la</em>- with\nthe French article.  Latin <em>mandragora</em> 'mandrake' became\nFrench <em>main de gloire</em>.</p>\n<p>False analysis created French <em>candel-arbre</em> literally 'candletree,'\nfrom <em>candelabre</em> from Latin <em>candelabrum</em> in which\n-<em>abrum</em> is merely a neuter suffix.  And <em>noble</em>, a coin of France\nand, later, of England, originated because of association with\nLatin <em>nobilis</em>, whereas its true origin was in Greek <em>obolos</em>,\nrendered as <em>un obol(os)</em>.  (This latter kind of false analysis also\ngave rise to English <em>(an) apron</em> and <em>(an) adder</em>, from <em>a napron</em>\nand <em>a nadder</em>.)</p>\n<p>Slang loanwords in Italian from English include <em>tiltato</em>\n'tired' and <em>flippato</em> 'excited' from English slang <em>tilted</em> (as in\npinball machine lingo) and <em>flipped (out)</em>.</p>\n<p>It is not always easy to tell whether a slang coinage has\narisen because speakers are being playful, secretive, or discreet.\nCertainly much of criminal slang may be the result of deliberate\nsecretiveness, and the creation of neologisms for narcotics\nseems to lag only slightly behind the adoption by the unhip of\nterms that have been around for a while: <em>dope, snow, smack</em>,\nand their synonyms are quickly replaced by dealers who trade\nin language as readily as in drugs.  Discretion in avoiding taboo\nwords is evidenced by some expressions in British rhyming\nslang: <em>Bristol Cities</em> for <em>titties</em>, for instance.  (For many more\nsamples, see <em>A Dictionary of Rhyming Slang</em>, by J. Franklyn,\nRoutledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1960.)  On the other hand, <em>titfer</em>,\nshort for <em>tit for tat</em>, which is rhyming slang for <em>hat</em>, can hardly\nbe more than mere playfulness, likewise <em>trouble and strife</em> for\n<em>wife</em>—unless she is within earshot.  Discretion was also at work\nin Austrian <em>Das ist für Friedrich</em>, literally 'It is for Frederick'\nbut really meaning 'It is worthless.'  This is a reduction of <em>Das\nist für Arsch und Friedrich</em> in which <em>Arsch</em> 'arse' has been\nsuppressed: <em>für Arsch und Friedrich</em> 'good-for-nothing.'</p>\n<p>English <em>(the) blues</em> is traced to a shortening of <em>(the) blue\ndevils</em>, which had its association with <em>delirium tremens</em> and its\nhallucinations.  The Austrian 1000-Schilling banknote was\ndubbed <em>ein Blauer</em> 'a blue one,' but that designation has given\nway to <em>Jeans</em>—yes, in Austrian slang—on the obvious association\nwith something everyone recognizes as being blue.  (For the\nmost interesting treatment of <em>blue</em> see William Gass's book <em>On\nBeing Blue</em>, Godine Press.)  Other metaphoric reflexes can be\nseen in Italian <em>autostrada</em>, 'a skinny girl' (lit. 'highway')\n(because she has no curves), Italian <em>ossigeno</em>, 'money' (lit.\n'oxygen' because you can't live without it), Austrian and\nGerman <em>Mühle</em>, 'bicycle' (lit. 'mill' because one has to grind\naway at pedaling), Austrian <em>Hebamme</em>, 'corkscrew' (lit. 'midwife'\nby obvious analogy).  <em>Not worth a bean</em> appears in\nGerman as <em>nicht die Bohne</em>, where it has also acquired the\nmeaning 'certainly not.'</p>\n<p>Slang is sometimes characterized by understatement—\nlitotes, if you want the literary term for the device.  In English\nwe see <em>lift, liberate</em>, and other euphemistic words for 'steal.'\nThe normally harmless (though seemingly infinitely productive)\nword <em>take</em> appears in this context, too, as in the old song:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mamie took the measles, Mamie took to bed,<br>\nMamie took a doctor, and this is what he said:<br>\n“Take a little something, till you're feeling prime.”<br>\nMamie has been taking something—something all the\ntime.<br>\nOnce she took a notion in a dry-goods store—<br>\nShe would be a lady, that if nothing more—<br>\nBut the bold floorwalker made her put it back:<br>\nMamie was a klepto-Mamie...klepto-Mamiac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In French, <em>prendre</em> (lit. 'take') means 'steal,' and, for other\nexamples of understatement one need look no further than\nTurkish <em>kaşimak</em> (lit. 'scratch') 'beat someone up'; Latin\n<em>infirmitas</em> (lit. 'weakness') 'disease'; Turkish <em>genel ev</em> (lit. 'open\nhouse') 'brothel'; French <em>poison</em> (lit. 'poison') from Latin\n<em>potionem</em> 'drink'; French <em>enceinte</em> (lit. 'girded') 'pregnant.'  This\ndevice is so familiar in English that we scarcely pay much\nattention to it: <em>lady of the evening, call girl, working girl</em> are\nwell-known euphemisms for prostitute; <em>(a) story</em> for <em>(a) lie</em>;\n<em>second-story man</em> for <em>sneak-thief</em>; <em>cosa nostra</em> (lit., in Italian,\n'our thing') borrowed into English for <em>(the) Mafia</em>, etc.</p>\n<p>On the other side, we have euphemism and overstatement:\nLatin <em>mentiri</em> (lit. 'to mention') 'to lie,' comparable to Italian\n<em>trovare</em> (lit. 'to find, locate') with the same meaning; Spanish\n<em>ester pelado</em> (lit. 'to be skinned') 'to be robbed' (compare\nEnglish <em>skin</em> or <em>fleece</em> (someone), etc.); Slovenian <em>sveta vodica</em>\n(lit. 'holy water') 'brandy' (compare Gaelic <em>uisgebeatha</em>, lit.\n'water of life,' now <em>whiskey</em>); Italian <em>bottega</em> (lit. 'shop')\n'prison,' <em>cadavere</em> (lit. 'carcass') 'ugly person'; Turkish\n<em>temizlemek</em> (lit. 'clean up') 'kill' and <em>sari kiz</em> (lit. 'blonde girl')\n'hashish'; Arabic <em>abu jahja</em> (lit. 'father of life') 'angel of death';\nItalian <em>il benedetto</em> (lit. 'the blessed one') 'epilepsy'; Slovenian\n<em>sindicalista</em> (lit. 'trade unionist, syndicalist') 'prostitute'; German\n<em>Emaille</em> (lit. 'enamel') 'make-up'; Turkish <em>isci</em> (lit. 'worker')\n'thief,' <em>esnaf</em> (lit. 'craftsman') 'prostitute,' and <em>toz</em> (lit. 'dust')\n'heroin'; English <em>bracelets</em> 'handcuffs'; Turkish <em>okşamak</em> (lit.\n'caress') 'beat someone up.'  The examples seem endless, and,\nindeed, this area is extremely productive of new applications of\nexisting words.  It would seem, though, that, in addition to\nplayfulness, sardonicism creeps into the naming process.\n(Indeed, the word <em>sardonic</em> itself is traced to the name given to\na Sardinian plant, which, when eaten, was said to produce\nconvulsive laughter ending in death.)</p>\n<p>We have seen that French <em>tête</em> 'head' came from the Latin\nslang word for 'head,' <em>testa</em> (lit. 'pot'); the expected form, from\nstandard Latin <em>caput</em> 'head' would have been <em>chef</em> or <em>chief</em>,\nsurviving mainly in the metaphoric sense 'chief.'  It remains,\nthough in, <em>kerchief</em> (from Middle English <em>kerchef</em> from Old\nFrench <em>cuevrechef</em> 'cover-head'), which appears also as Modern\nEnglish <em>handkerchief</em> (from the time when kerchiefs were\ncarried about in the hand for uses other than covering the\nhead), and in <em>pocket handkerchief</em> ('a headcovering carried in\nthe hand and kept in the pocket').  But I digress.  In English\nslang we have seen <em>bad</em> meaning 'good' <em>(He's real bad on the\nalto sax)</em>, though I think that sense may now be fading.  It may\nor may not be comforting to know that speakers of other\nlanguages engage in the same practice of “opposites”: Italian\n<em>bestiale</em> (lit. 'brutish, bestial; atrocious') 'great, marvelous, good'\nand <em>bestia</em> (lit. 'beast') 'friendly'; German <em>Strick</em> (lit. 'rope')\n'necktie'; Turkish <em>gavurca</em> (lit. 'language of the unbelievers')\n'any foreign language' (compare the origin of <em>barbarian</em>).</p>\n<p>As I commented earlier, it is not always easy to determine\nwhat motivates speakers to coin slang paraphrases: Is it\nsometimes merely the desire to avoid the old clichés (and\ncreate new ones)?  Can it be reflective of an effort to avoid\ncalling a spade a spade?  These and other factors are surely at\nwork in expressions that avoid the use of <em>crazy</em> and <em>insane</em>,\nespecially when those terms are not meant literally.  But here,\nagain, we get into trouble with <em>crazy</em>, which survives in its\noriginal, etymological and literal senses only in <em>crazy</em> ('irregularly\npatterned') <em>quilt</em> and in describing ceramic objects as\n<em>crazed</em>, the latter possibly bringing us full circle to Latin <em>testa</em>\n'(ceramic) pot' and, almost literally, to <em>cracked</em> (in the head).  In\nAustrian we have <em>hin bei der Marilln</em> (lit. 'defect in the\napricot'), in French <em>sauterelle dans la guitare</em> (lit. 'grasshopper\nin the guitar') and <em>hanneton dans le plafond</em> (lit. 'cockchafer in\nthe ceiling').  English resorts to <em>a screw loose, screwy, batty</em>\n(from <em>bats in the belfry), nutty, off one's rocker, off one's\ntrolley, dotty</em>, (British) <em>barmy (in the crumpet), a slate missing</em>,\nand just plain <em>nuts</em>.  Speakers also avoid talking about dying and\ndeath (as has been documented thoroughly elsewhere), resorting\nto <em>the grim reaper, (gathered to) Abraham's bosom, pass\naway, kick the bucket, buy the farm, meet one's maker</em>, and,\nfor the bankrupt whose backer predeceased him, <em>to meet one's\ncomaker</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we come to the unanalyzable, to those expressions\nthat Sornig describes as “downright absurdities”: Russian <em>odin\nkak spička</em> 'alone like a match'; German <em>dumm wie Bohnenstroh</em>\n(lit. 'stupid as bean straw') 'extremely stupid'; Turkish\n<em>çeviz kirmak</em> (lit. 'crack the walnut') and <em>findik kirmak</em> (lit.\n'crack the hazelnut') 'be a favorite with the ladies'; German\n<em>Anno Tabak</em> (lit. 'in the year of tobacco') 'in olden times';\nItalian <em>Zucche!</em> (lit. 'pumpkin') 'Certainly not!'</p>\n<p>Some slang is fleeting, particularly in these times when\nnewly minted coinages rapidly acquire the staleness of age\nthrough overexposure on television, radio, and in the press:\nthere is nothing more tiresome than a freshly created cliché.\nSome slang acquires respectability (e.g., French <em>tête</em>, English\n<em>jazz</em>).  Some remains vulgar, taboo, or just “slang.”  Some is\ncrude, some colorful, some insightful, some absurd.  Yet most of\nit is poetic—at least in the sense that it makes greater than\nordinary use of poetical devices like litotes, hyperbole, and,\nabove all, metaphor.  Of the two most productive sources of\nnew language, technology, which yields terms like <em>telephone,\ntransistor</em>, and <em>betalipoproteinemia</em>, and slang, which yields\n<em>climb the wall, horse</em>, and <em>swell</em>, which do you consider to be\n<em>real neat?</em></p>",
