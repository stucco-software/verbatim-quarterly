Gil Friedman, (Yara Press P. O. Box 1063, Arcata, California, 1990), xiv + 166pp.</p>\n<p>This is not a proper dictionary but a compilation\nof 600 quotations about love, companionship, etc.\n... “from the profane to the profound divided into\n191 categories by more that 300 authors, philosophers\nand celebrities including Kahlil Gibran, Bertrand\nRussell, Erich Fromm, Mother Theresa and\nZsa Zsa Gabor,” as the cover tells us.  How can 600\nquotations make up 166 pages you ask?  Well, the\nquotations actually make up 134 pages, with pages\n137-155 devoted to an Authors' Index, 157-163 to\na Bibliography, and 164-166 to a (continued) list of\npermissions acknowledgments.  The front matter\ncontains an alphabetical listing of the 191 categories.\nPerhaps the reader can tell that this is not my\nkind of book, but if one is a writer of Valentine's Day\ngreeting cards, or eschews the “From Poopsie to\nWoopsie” approach in advertising in <em>The Times</em>, or\njust has to collect everything that mentions love,\nthen order the book directly from the publisher.  My\nfavorite: “When Woodrow proposed to me, I was so\nsurprised I nearly fell out of bed.”—The second\nMrs. Woodrow Wilson.  Of course, we are not told\nwhose bed.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
