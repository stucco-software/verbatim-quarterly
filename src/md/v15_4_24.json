By extension <em>brahman</em>\ncame to mean a 'member of the sacred or sacerdotal\ncaste,' as <em>Webster</em> has it.  In order to avoid confusion\nI shall henceforth spell the word without capitalization\nto denote the 'caste' and with a capital to\nimply 'the Absolute.'  This in fact is the crux of the\nproblem.  When we use the word <em>Absolute</em> with a capital\n“a” we know that it has a very specific application.\nIt is high time that <em>brahman</em> be so spelt when the caste\nis implied, reserving <em>Brahman</em> when 'the Absolute' is\nmeant.  This will not only help the reader to distinguish\nbetween the two meanings but will conform to\nconventional capitalization in the English language.</p>\n<p>The error was originally made by the British in\n17th-century India.  Not only were the brahmans the\nbest educated Hindus they met, but also, more important,\nit was soon realized that among the Hindus the\nbrahman was a much more “sacred” group than say\nthe <em>molla</em> is among the Muslims, the <em>rabbi</em> among the\nJews, or the <em>priest</em> among the Christians.  From time\nimmemorial the brahmans of India had insisted upon\ntheir social and spiritual superiority.  In many of the\ncommon Sanskrit prayers a brahman is invoked or imprecated\nalong with the gods.  To do reverence to a\nbrahman was to do reverence to Brahman, for a brahman\nwas not simply the intermediary between man\nand the gods: he was a god.</p>\n<p>Confronted with this attitude and somewhat\nawed, the British acknowledged their respect by capitalizing\nthe word.  But what is even more curious is\nthat they also capitalized the expressions for the three\nother castes, viz. <em>kshatriya</em> 'martial class,' <em>vaisya</em> 'farmers\nand merchants,' and <em>sudra</em> 'menials.'  It is remarkable\nthat this anomaly still persists, even in many modern\nsources.</p>\n<p>The English-speaking world, expecially Great\nBritain, Canada, the U.S.A., and even India claim to\nbe the bastions of democracy, which clearly should not\nrecognize caste or class distinctions.  Is it not ironic\nthen that they should still perpetuate so blatant a fallacy?\nCompilers of our dictionaries should stop capitalizing\nthe words for the four Hindu castes and retain\nthe custom only for Brahma or Brahman when it implies\nthe Absolute.  Not only will it avoid confusion\namong users of dictionaries, but it will restore the\npreeminence of Brahma or Brahman while reducing\nthe brahmans to the status of the rest of us mortals,\nwhere they really belong.</p>\n<p><em>Harare (Reuter)</em> - A Latin greeting from the Pope\nbrought Zimbabwe's Parliament to a halt when the\nJustice Minister, Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa, objected\nto the use of what was not an official language.
