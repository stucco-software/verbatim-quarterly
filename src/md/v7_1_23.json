Eric Partridge, always very well-informed about\nmilitary slang, said that <em>chuff</em> had been used in the British\nArmy since about 1930 to mean 'food,' on the analogy of\n<em>chow</em>. Partridge gave as a second meaning of <em>chuff</em>, with\npretty precision, 'stimulation of male member by lumbar\nthrust in coition.' Whatever did the Prime Minister of New\nZealand, Mr. Holyoake, mean, in that case, when he used\n<em>to sit on one's chuff</em> to mean 'to sit back and do nothing'?</p>\n<p>Partridge noted the Janus meanings of <em>chuffed</em>. He\ndeclared that if one needed to distinguish them, one said\n<em>chuffed to fuck</em> or <em>chuffed to arseholes</em> or <em>chuffed pink</em> or\n<em>bo-chuffed</em> to mean 'gruntled,' and dead <em>chuffed</em> to mean\n'disgruntled.'</p>\n<p>Squadron Leader John Bloomfield of the RAF in Suffolk\nsent us an official Ministry of Defence memorandum\nabout chuffedâ€”RAF version 1960s:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Pongos have missed the nuances of the word and\nits proper use.<br>\n<em>dead chuffed,</em> very pleased<br>\n<em>highly chuffed,</em> quite pleased<br>\n<em>chuffed,</em> pleased<br>\n<em>dis-chuffed,</em> disenchanted<br>\n<em>chokka</em> (or <em>chockered</em>), displeased<br>\n<em>right chokka,</em> very displeased<br>\n(<em>Right and dead</em> can be transposed.)<br>\nHence I'm <em>chuffed</em> by your occasional articles. I'd be\n<em>dead chuffed</em> if you referred to the above, but <em>right\nchokka</em> if you can't be bothered to acknowledge this\nnote.<br>\nP.S. <em>Choked off</em> is another matter entirely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I doubt whether we are ever going to arrive at an explanation\nof <em>chuffed</em> that is going to satisfy everyone. In any\ncase the Janus word is distinctly old-fashioned in British\nEnglish.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile I am fussing about the piece of American\nslang <em>laid back</em> that has recently become all the rage in\nBritish journalism. I know that it means, roughly, 'cool,\neasy-going, relaxed, and generally admirable.' It is the derivation\nthat puzzles me. Is it just slumped back in one's\ncharacter as in one's chair? Or is it, more interestingly, a\npiece of Californian psychobabble?</p>\n<h2></h2>",
