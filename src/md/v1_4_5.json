One is:\n<em>Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames</em>, by Luis d'Antin van\nRooten, Grossman, 1967.  In that slender volume the\nauthor regaled a still slenderer audience with his\nfanatical phonetical rendition of children's rhymes,\nand worse, and it was merely necessary to read the\ncontents aloud in one's second-year French to have\nan ear-opening experience and to enjoy a feast of nonsensical\nproportions.</p>\n<p>I am sure that readers will recognize in <em>tous et\ncontes</em>, or two seconds, that the title is “Mother Goose\nRhymes.”  Having grasped that much, they are ready\nfor the following: “Raia qu'écorce/turban beret crosse\n/toussez afin laide y/a peau ne ouate torse/,” which is\nobviously, “Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross,” etc.\nIn the same (jocular) vein, but in reverse disorder, I\nunashamedly attempt a mad English version of the\nfollowing:</p>\n<p>If you failed to recognize the “Marshy Haze,” you are\nundoubtedly a good French scholar.</p>\n<p>On an equally low plane, if not lower, is the brash\nvolume <em>Anguish Language</em> by Howard L. Chase,\nPrentice-Hall, 1956.  This, unlike van Rooten's crime,\nconfines itself to a monolingual view, which is at once\nmore restricted and more demanding.  There is less\nphonetic exactitude but somehow greater play of\nphonetic fancy; if there is parody, it is largely incidental,\nsave in some grandiose overall fashion.  Two\nwell-known song titles emerge as “Freeze a Jolly Good\nFurlough” and “Hormone Derange” and convey some\nidea of the possibilities for metrical mayhem.  I submit\nwithout fear of praise the following effort of my own in\nthat direction:</p>\n<p>And, as a warning of the vile possibilities, I cite, from\nreams of ruinous efforts, the following titles (or first\nlines) of other works mangled by me:</p>\n<p>And, returning to a bilingual relationship, I close with\nthe beginning of the Aeneid, that resounding hexed\nammeter: “Armed with a rum cake and dough; crows\nlike he creamed us as tories.”  The effectiveness of this\ndepends upon standard American public high-school\nLatin pronunciation, obviously that employed by\nP. Wear-Gillious Marrow himself.  <em>Qu'ouate un oeuf!</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
