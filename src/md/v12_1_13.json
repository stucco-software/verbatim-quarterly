Later, I noticed that <em>hendiadys</em> was defined on page 133\nas “the expression of an idea by two words connected by and,\nwhen normal usage would be to subordinate one to the other,”\nbut on page 178, one of the examples given of <em>hendiadys</em> was\n“He is a man of great wisdom,” instead of the normal usage,\n“He is a very wise man.”  The construction involving and,\nwhich was a central feature of the definition of <em>hendiadys</em>\ngiven earlier, is nowhere to be found in the illustration.
