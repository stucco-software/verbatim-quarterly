The first clue was the\nmorning it wrote <em>dau-ghter</em>, although it had been taught\nto divide -<em>er</em>, like -<em>ly</em>.  The new choice was the subject of\nmuch breakfast discussion.  We reasoned that <em>daughter</em> is\na long word to shoeborn into the end of a narrow newspaper\ncolumn, that at -<em>er</em> the word still wouldn't fit, and\nthe computer must have used-in doing its best to fill the\nline-what appeared to be an arcane magnetic principle not\nimmediately apparent.  We felt we might be watching the\nbirth of inanimate intelligence.</p>\n<p>I must report that the <em>Times Herald Record</em> computer\nhas grown smarter.  It has dispensed with most historic\nas well as inhalation principles and does largely what\nit knows best: it counts; then very matter of factly it chops\noff the word, <em>Hatai!</em>  Here are three examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Ann Landers] Dear Glad: So am I.  I hope somebody out there listens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Witnesses said the violence was sparked off when a\ngroup of blacks tried to set fire to a Zulu boardingouse\nand the tribesmen retaliated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nixon's intended gifts of his San Clemente home could\ngive him a big tax deduction for six years.  Sort of a “squeezing\ncitizens” home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The computer counts so well that very few words are\nnow hyphenated in the paper, a great saving of space.\nAnd the new syllabication has enlivened the news, sometimes\nturning it into far-out poetry.</p>\n<p>But for certain readers, it's not good news.  Pulling\napart words into their syllables may be the most efficient\nway for poor readers to figure out printed matter.  There\nare hordes of marginal readers today who, for many other\nreasons, have already given up reading newspapers.  Dashing\nthe language any which way is, for them, no joke.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In a front-page article in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>\n[Nov, 9, 1976] about “Winners &amp; Sinners,” the <em>N.Y. Times</em>\nhouse organ dealing with grammatical and stylistic goodies\nand baddies in <em>The Times</em>, the information appears that\n<em>The Philadelphia Bulletin</em> has a similar bulletin.  To quote\nthe <em>WSJ</em>: “ 'The big problem is finding the time to sustain\nit,' says Sam Boyle, the Bulletin's assistant managing editor\nresponsible for Second Guessing [the title of the house organ].\n'It may not look like it's hard to put out, but believe\nme, it is.' ”</p>\n<p>We'll take you at your word, Sam.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
