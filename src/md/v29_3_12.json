Look closely at the map and you will see marked high on the hillside above the village the words Stennerskeugh Clouds. From the foot of the hill you might mistake them for clouds, but climbing the steep hillside, you can see they are large limestone outcrops gleaming through the green turf. This is Viking country—and no doubt the Viking named Steinarr was deceived then as we are today. It set me thinking that the word <em>cloud</em> must be related to <em>clod</em>, and this sent me scurrying to my <em>Shorter OED</em> to unravel the mystery. So I find the word comes originally from Old English <em>clúd</em> meaning 'lump or clod of earth,' and thence to <em>cloud,</em> used occasionally, as in this case, as a descriptive place name.</p>\n<p><em>Clod</em> leads us to <em>clot</em>, also a kind of lump, as in blood clot or clotted cream. Here we have the first hint of “stickiness” in the meaning: as also in <em>clay</em> (from OE <em>clæg</em>), the kind of soil that sticks to your boots, and <em>cloying,</em> a taste that doesn't leave your mouth. Stickiness of a different form brings us to <em>cleave</em>, that Janus word beloved of <em>VERBATIM</em> readers. <em>Cleavers</em> or goose-grass, a weed in my garden, is the stickiest of plants, both seeds and leaves clinging tenaciously to clothing, thus spreading it everywhere. The <em>OED</em> suggests a link to <em>climb</em> and <em>clamber</em> (these from OE <em>climban</em>), which takes us back to the rocky imagery too. <em>Clay</em> is related to <em>clog</em> ('block up,' 'hamper,' or 'hinder' and <em>claggy</em> (which means 'sticky'). <em>Claggum</em> is an old dialect word for treacle toffee, and <em>clagger</em> is a nautical term for a pudding made “from flour and slush,” a somewhat cryptic description from my dictionary of historical slang. <em>Glue</em> and <em>glutinous</em> come from the same root too, only this time not through Old English but through Latin. <em>Clog</em> has a double meaning: the other, for a wooden shoe, meant initially 'a block of wood' (lumps again!).</p>\n<p><em>Clamp</em> and <em>clump</em> are “sticky” words as well, and take us to <em>clammy</em> (damp or slimy) and <em>clumsy</em> (heavy or awkward), this last one conveying an image of objects slipping, not sticking! <em>Clam</em> (from OE 'clam': to bond, fetter) and <em>cleat</em> (a device to stop rope from slipping) are two words meaning 'tight gripping' or 'clasping,' and this sense appears again as <em>clinch, clench, cling,</em> and <em>club</em> (in the sense of 'club together').</p>\n<p><em>Clout</em> is another word for a lump of earth but has other meanings too that take us down a different path. “Ne'er cast a clout till May be out” was the old saw repeated in my childhood, when we shivered in thin clothes during a cold snap in early summer. <em>Clout</em> here means 'clothing,' and 'cloth' and 'clothes' too. These all derive from Old English <em>cláþ.</em> The word <em>clothes</em> is one of the most difficult for an English learner to master, requiring great agility of tongue movement, both in and out. So it's not surprising therefore to find a shortened version <em>clo'</em> in the <em>OED</em> too, a 19th-century cockney word.</p>\n<p><em>Clad</em> and <em>cladding</em> continue the thread of meaning from cloth, with the added notion of 'wrapping,' and have the same derivation. This is where we get to <em>clootie dumpling,</em> 'a sausage-shaped fruit pudding wrapped in a muslin and steamed'; it is not unlike an English Christmas pudding in taste and is eaten all year in Northumbria and Scotland. <em>Clootie</em> is a 'rag' or 'cloth'; however, this derivation is a bit of a puzzle, as <em>Auld Clootie</em> is also a northern nickname for the devil, and is said to derive from <em>cloven</em> (as in cloven-hoofed). This would come therefore from the other face of the Janus word <em>cleave,</em> this one meaning 'to split.'</p>\n<p><em>Cloth, clod,</em> and <em>clot,</em> and <em>clay</em> too, have often been tied to terms for stupidity and clumsiness, such as <em>cloth-eared, cloth-head, clod-hopper</em>, <em>clodpole</em>, and <em>clay-brained</em>. And <em>you silly clot!</em> was a common insult in my (now far-off) schooldays—immortalised in English literature by that wonderful creation of Geoffrey Willans in the 1950s, the hilarious misspeller, Nigel Molesworth.</p>\n<p><em>Clout</em> has several more meanings: 'a <em>clout</em> on the head (a blow),' linked again to <em>club</em> (something to hit with). <em>Clout</em> is also used figuratively to mean 'having influence': Her new job brought her a great deal of <em>clout.</em>' You might say that <em>clouds</em> are only figurative 'lumps' too. This brings us back full circle; they are, of course, just floating lumps of water vapour. And the derivation of Stennerskeugh? Well, I'm hoping one of you will answer that.</p>\n<p><em>[Clare Passingham is a freelance EFL teacher.]</em></p>",
