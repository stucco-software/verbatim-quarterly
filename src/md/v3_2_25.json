I can add <em>larcenious</em> (for the more usual <em>larcenous</em>), <em>aerious</em> (which the 17th century used for <em>aerial</em>), and <em>caesious</em>.

Both sentences are entirely correct, <em>but</em> being used in its meaning of <em>except</em> in the former and of <em>only</em> in the latter.  What is of particular interest is that the latter usage descends from a stage of English when the <em>but</em> (for <em>except</em>) was combined with a negative <em>ne</em> or <em>n</em>' before the verb, e.g. <em>He n' is but a boy</em>.  Thus we find John Lydgate writing in the early 15th century, <em>They nentende nyght nor day/ But unto merthe</em>, and William Caxton, later in the century, penning, <em>I ne entende but onely to reduce thauncient rhyme to prose</em>.
