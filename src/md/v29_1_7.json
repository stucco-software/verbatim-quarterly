What's happened to how (almost) everyone says the numbers? I refer to inserting <em>and,</em> such as in “a hundred and fifty'' or ''two thousand and four.'' I was taught that this is incorrect. But folks we once used as good usage references, such as network news reporters on TV, NPR, etc., are, with rare exception, all doing it this way. How are the schools teaching it these days?</p>\n<p><em>[Park Waldrop, Atlanta]</em></p>\n<p>Susan Elkin (“Going But Not Quite Gone,” XXVIII/2) asks “What use would a pig be to be to anyone if it were small enough to fit in a pocket? A <em>poke</em> . . . is an old form of the word <em>pocket</em>.”</p>\n<p>I don't think the reference is to a pocket at all.</p>\n<p>The oldest meaning of <em>poke</em> (if the <em>OED</em> is to be believed) is a bag or sack. The phrase “a pig in a poke” (according to the <em>OED</em>) means to buy something without seeing or knowing its value, that is, an object of claimed value (a pig) that the buyer is unable to examine because it is hidden inside a bag or sack (the poke).</p>\n<p>Another marvelous saying is, I believe, related. After the price is paid, the buyer opens the poke and discovers, instead of a valuable pig, a worthless cat. That's called “letting the cat out of the bag.” The <em>OED</em> reports the meaning of that phrase is to disclose a secret, i.e., that the pig in the poke is actually a cat.</p>\n<p>The <em>OED</em> doesn't make the connection between these two phrases, and I can't tell you where I first heard or read it, but it has been with me for many decades.</p>\n<p><em>[Benjamin H. Cohen, Chicago]</em></p>",
