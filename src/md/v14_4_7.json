In a book of mine published about a year\nago, for some unaccountable reason, I wrote that the\nBrontë's real name was Bell, while, of course, as every\nliterate person knows, it was the other way round.\nThere are certain kinds of mistakes that are mystifying:\ndespite having been advised countless times that\nthe first syllable of the name of that city in Texas is\npronounced “Hugh” and not “Who,” British presenters,\ncommentators, announcers, and, seemingly, anyone\nwho gets a chance to do so on radio or TV pronounces\nit “Who-stin” or (worse) “Who-ston.”  If they can ever\nbe persuaded to say “Hugh” for “Who,” it will probably\nbe carried over to the New York City street name,\nspelled the same way but pronounced “How-stin,” and\nwe shall be going on about that.</p>\n<p>Recently, published materials (articles, books,\netc.) written by otherwise qualified, usually responsible,\nand traditionally careful scholars have contained\nunconscionable errors—errors that could have been\navoided by minimal checking.  I will come to the article\nlater; for the moment, let us look at the book in\nhand.  For 20 years David Crystal was Professor of\nLinguistic Science at the University of Reading.  A few\nyears ago he resigned to write and, generally, to pursue\nstudies that do not include full-time teaching,\nthough he is an Honorary Professor at University College,\nBangor.  He is also linguistics consultant to <em>English\nToday</em>, a relatively new British language quarterly.\nI personally know Crystal to be a good scholar, and I\nlike his relaxed writing style.  All the more reason for\nme to express some surprise at some of the misinformation\nfound in his book.  A chapter on British and American\nEnglish begins with nine more or less categorical\nremarks about American pronunciation; unfortunately,\nmost of them are wrong:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The middle vowel of <em>tomato</em> rhymes with <em>mate</em>\nin AmE, but with <em>car</em> in BrE.  [As the song goes,\nyou say <em>tomayto</em> and I say <em>tomahto</em>.  Both\npronunciations occur in AmE, and a quick\ncheck in an AmE dictionary would have yielded\nthat information.]</p>\n<p>The first syllable of <em>lever</em> rhythms <em>[sic]</em> with that\nof <em>level</em> in AmE, and with <em>leaver</em> in BrE.  [I\ndon't know what the percentages or distributions\nare, but again, a quick check in an AmE dictionary\nwould have revealed that speakers of\nAmE—a lot of them, in fact—say “leaver.”]</p>\n<p>Conversely, the first syllable of <em>leisure</em> rhymes\nwith <em>lee</em> in AmE, but has the vowel of <em>let</em> in\nBrE.  [At this point one wonders whether Crystal\nhad gathered incorrect data within a single dialect\narea in the U.S. or whether he'd simply had\na bad informant.  The AmE dictionaries I\nchecked all gave both pronunciations.  Perhaps\nCrystal has little or no respect for (American)\ndictionaries and deliberately ignored them in\nfavor of his own or his informant's data.  He\nwas ill-advised to do so, for they happen to be\ncorrect.]</p>\n<p><em>Vase</em> rhymes with <em>days</em> in AmE, with <em>cars</em>\nin BrE.  [For some Americans, this word rhymes\nwith <em>base</em>, for some with <em>days</em>, and for some\nwith <em>cars</em> (without the “r”).  It might be true\nthat the last, “more British” pronunciation is\nused when a Ming vase is referred to, while either\nof the first two is used for an ordinary vase\nfrom Woolworth's, but that has not been confirmed.]</p>\n<p><em>Docile</em> is 'doss-ile' in AmE, but 'doe-sile' in BrE.\nThe -<em>ile</em> ending regularly changes in this way:\n<em>missile</em> is often pronounced like <em>missal</em> in AmE,\nand similarly <em>fertile, hostile</em>, etc.  [This is a bit\nmore complicated: the second syllables of <em>hostile,\nfertile</em>, and a few other words were once\nuniformly pronounced to rhyme with <em>pill</em> in\nAmE; in the past 30 years or so, possibly because\nthe psychologists and psychiatrists (who\nuse <em>hostile</em> almost as a technical term) felt that\npronouncing it to rhyme with <em>pile</em> removed it\nsomewhat from the grasp of lay speakers, started\nsaying “hos-tile” rather than “hos-til.”  Some\nAmE speakers caught the bug and, though they\nare not in the field, affectedly say “hos-tile.”  This\nhas been carried over to <em>fertile</em>, perhaps, but\nthere is no evidence that it has cropped up in\n<em>missile</em> or <em>docile</em>.]</p>\n<p><em>Herb</em> is pronounced without the initial <em>h</em> in\nAmE, but with the <em>h</em> in BrE.  [That is certainly\ncorrect, but it might have been interesting to\nhave added that in AmE <em>herbaceous, herbalist,\nherbarium, herbicide, herbivore, herbivorous,\nherbology, herborist</em>, and <em>herborize</em> are usually\npronounced with the <em>h</em>, but (in addition to\n<em>herb) herbal, herbless, herblike, herbage</em>, and\n<em>herby</em> are usually pronounced without it.]</p>\n<p>Many words have the stress in different places:</p>\n<p><em>AmE</em> debris address inquiry magazine\n<em>BrE</em> debris address inquiry magazine\nAnd several words which have one main stress in\nBrE have two in AmE: <em>AmE</em> Birmingham\n<em>BrE</em> Birmingham</p>\n<p>[(I have not included words about which Crystal\nis right.)  Some AmE speakers do say daybree,\naddress, inquiry, and magazine, so again Crystal\nwas misinformed, and the AmE pronunciation\nBirmingham is usually reserved for the\nAmerican cities in Michigan and Alabama, with\nBirmingham for the city in England.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All this is most unfortunate.  In his comments on\nspelling, Crystal refers to “some BrE spellings [that]\nare used in the U.S. (e.g. <em>enclose, judgement</em>).”  I suppose\nit depends on one's point of view, but the facts of\nthe matter are that <em>inclose</em> is far less frequent in AmE\nthan <em>enclose</em> and that the spelling <em>judgement</em> was originally\nthe AmE spelling till Noah Webster's simplified\nspelling campaign removed the <em>e</em> (and effected other\nchanges, like dropping the <em>u</em> from words like <em>honour,\ncolour</em>, etc.).  Also, <em>mould</em> is sometimes so spelled in\nAmE, and, while the preferred spelling is <em>theater</em> in\nwritten text, it is very likely that the names of most of\nthe theaters in the U.S. contain the word spelled <em>theatre</em>,\npossibly because it is felt to have more cachet.\n<em>Smoulder</em> is a free spelling variant of <em>smolder</em>, and\nAmericans usually write <em>endorse</em> in preference to <em>indorse.\nEnsure</em> is the preferred form when the sense is\n'guarantee, make sure, make safe' but <em>insure</em> when the\nsense is 'guarantee against loss or harm, procure an\ninsurance policy against.'  <em>Fibre</em> is frequently seen,\nthough not as often as <em>fiber</em>.  Among the individual\nitems listed, <em>moustache</em> is almost in free variation with\n<em>mustache, storey</em> 'building floor' with <em>story, tsar</em> with\n<em>czar</em>.  BrE spells <em>programme</em> that way except when referring\nto computer software, and AmE writes <em>programmed,\nprogramming, programmer</em> only in the\ncontext of computers.  Although Americans were once\ntaught to spell <em>kidnaper, kidnaped, kidnaping</em> that\nway, they appear far more often today with two <em>ps</em>.</p>\n<p>Other fables, either concocted or perpetuated by\nthe author, are that Americans do not say <em>twenty to\nfour</em> or <em>five past eight</em>, preferring <em>twenty of four</em> and\n<em>five after eight</em>; that they say <em>real good</em> for <em>really good</em>\n(some do, of course, but it is considered a solecism);\nthat they say <em>in back of</em> for <em>behind</em> (they say either; it is\nthe Brits who do not say <em>in back of</em>); that they prefer <em>a\nhalf hour</em> to <em>half an hour</em>, etc.  Crystal does remark,\n“variations in style are not noted,” but what he might,\nmore accurately, have said was that some of the constructions\nin the AmE column are not usual in BrE\nand vice versa.  Nonetheless, some are simply wrong:\nAmE does not say <em>I'm visiting with her tomorrow</em> in\npreference to <em>I'm visiting her tomorrow, I'll go get the\ncar</em> in preference to <em>I'll go and get the car, Come take a\nlook</em> in preference to <em>Come and take a look, I asked\nthat he leave</em> in preference to <em>I asked him to leave</em>, etc.</p>\n<p>Where these bits of misinformation come from is\nnot easy to determine: most of the sources listed in\nAppendices B and C are British, with the possible exception\nof Whitney F. Bolton, who might be an American\n(his book, with which I am not familiar, was published\nby Random House) and who collaborated with\nCrystal on a book, and <em>The State of the Language</em>, by\nMichaels and Ricks.  As I have remarked on other occasions,\nin recent BrE the word <em>billion</em> is used to mean\n'thousand million,' not, as Crystal has it, 'million million'\n(though that was the way it was once used).  The\nfinancial pages of the newspapers in Britain and the\nnumerous radio and television programs dealing with\nfinance and business consistently use <em>billion</em> to mean\n'thousand million,' as in AmE.  <em>Pavement</em> in AmE does\nnot mean 'road surface' but 'any paved surface (road\nor sidewalk).'  The chapter concludes with a list of\nAmE and BrE equivalents some of which are quite\nmisleading: for example, when BrE <em>sofa</em> is equated\nwith AmE <em>couch</em> or <em>davenport</em>, is the reader to understand\nthat AmE does not have <em>sofa?</em>  That BrE does not\nhave <em>davenport</em> or <em>couch?</em>  Of course, BrE has <em>couch,</em>\nbut <em>davenport</em> sounds distinctly old-fashioned in AmE,\nwhich, of course, has <em>sofa</em>.  There are many other similar\nconfusions, none of which is resolved by the simple\nlisting of pairs of words.  The problem is that BrE\n<em>roundabout</em> is AmE <em>traffic circle</em>, and neither is customarily\nused in the other dialect; that is true about a\ncertain number of the pairs—<em>check (mark) / tick,\ncheckers / draughts, diaper / nappy, dish towel / tea\ntowel, drug store / chemist, eggplant / aubergine, gas /\npetrol, elevator / lift</em>, etc.  But other words need more\nto be said about them, since they are not mutually\nexclusive in either dialect: AmE does use <em>sweets, sweet\ncorn, sofa, cot, autumn, tap, tramp, ...</em> and BrE\ndoes use <em>couch, detour, fall</em>.</p>\n<p>I have always felt that a relaxed, colloquial style\nof writing does not, of necessity, require the admittance\nof nonstandard usage.  Moreover, it seems indefensible\nin a book on language to use nonstandard\nconstructions when they add nothing to the communication\nwith the reader, especially when standard usage\nwould in no way interfere with the message.  Thus, I\nam bothered by the following, which appear to be\nalmost deliberate, for Crystal is certainly not a sloppy\nwriter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The problem is how to choose between the\nmany indigenous languages ...” [p.3]</p>\n<p>“But why [choose] English?  In Ghana, Nigeria,\nand many other countries, the choice is motivated\nby the weight of historical tradition from\nthe British or American colonial era.” [p.3.\nWhat does this mean?  The British colonial era\nwas, largely, the 19th century, when Britain colonized\nother countries; the American colonial\nera was, largely, the 17th and 18th centuries,\nwhen it was being colonized by Britain.]</p>\n<p>[The subject of splitting infinitives, discussed\non p. 25, suggests that the rules against it were\nfirst ariculated by Lowth and others in the mid\n18th century, but Dryden's objection to the practice\nappeared almost a hundred years earlier.]</p>\n<p>[p. 53: In the pronunciation of <em>glimpsed</em>, the\ntranscription should have an “I” not an “i”:\n/ glImpst /.]</p>\n<p>[p.60: “<em>apparatus</em>... vowel in 3rd syllable as\nin <em>car</em> or *<em>fate</em>” AmE would have the vowel of\n<em>hat</em>.</p>\n<p>“<em>derisive</em>... vowel in 2nd syllable as in\n*<em>rice</em> or <em>rise</em>” The vowel is the same, so it should\nread, “<em>s</em> as in *<em>rice</em> or <em>rise</em>”]</p>\n<p>“... the same vowel sound turns up in <em>cot</em>\nand <em>wash</em> [p.72: That rather depends on the dialect,\ndoesn't it?]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These criticisms having been registered, it is fair\nto note that they appear in only small sections of the\nbook, the majority of which deals with other aspects of\nlanguage.  The chapter on Personal English and those\ndealing with the History of English are among the best\nI have ever read.  Bearing in mind that the intention is\nto remain quite informal in approach and that certain\nmatters (like the Great Vowel Shift) are referred to\nobliquely rather than being treated as fully as one\nmight expect in a thorough-going text, Crystal succeeds\nin making interesting and lucid the subjects that\nare covered.  Because of the omission of the straightforward,\nscholarly impedimenta for the sake of producing\na “user-friendly” approach, it is difficult to see the\napplication of the book except for the purposes set\nforth by the author in his Introduction—“what, in the\nworld of travel, tourists would expect to find in a\n'guide' or a 'companion.' ”  To focus on that comparison,\nwhich is borne out in the subtitle, “A guided tour\nof the language,” I must say that it follows the lead of\nthe more superficial guides of the type: it emerges as\nmore of a <em>Good Food Guide</em> than as a traditional\n<em>Baedeker</em> (which, after all, directed the reader's attention\nto the art and culture of the sites to be visited).  Of\nits kind, <em>The English Language</em> is by far the most\npalatable, given my earlier reservations.  The questionable\nbits (like the sidebars, on pages 198 and 199, listing\nShakespearian and Biblical “Idioms,” most of\nwhich, in my opinion, would be classed as metaphors)\nneed reexamination, and it is hoped that a second\nedition might yield an approach to some of the objectionable\nareas that finds the author focusing on the\nsubject more than on an attempt at reaching the lowest\ncommon denominator of reader.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
