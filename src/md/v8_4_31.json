However, I must correct a universal\nmisapprehension that the author, Norman Ward, accepts as\ntrue: the words <em>papaya</em> and <em>papaw</em> (or <em>paw-paw</em>) may seem to\nbe interchangeable, but they are not.  The <em>papaya</em> is a tropical\nmelonlike fruit found growing in semitropical climes like that\nof Cuba, Hawaii, Southern California, Florida, and Mexico; the\n<em>papaw</em> is a watermelon-shaped fruit about three to four inches\nlong....  It is ripe for only a short time and is messy to eat\nbecause of its numerous flat, black seeds, about one third of an\ninch long.  The skin of the papaw, which turns from pale green\nto yellow when the fruit is ripe, is very tough and has to be\npeeled off before eating....  The first filling I ever had was paid\nfor with a large sack of papaws: the dentist adored them!  That\ncould never have happened with papayas, for they didn't grow\nin Kentucky.  I am sorry to say that the papaw tree has all but\ndisappeared from the scene.  I am sure that most of the younger\ngeneration has never even heard of papaws—much less tasted\none.</p>\n<p><em>[Carolyn Opitz, Carson City, Nevada]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
