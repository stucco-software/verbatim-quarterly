Recently, one of\nthe actresses in the series died, driving virtually all\nEngland into mourning; even the TV news and newspapers\ngave the event long shrift.  Although encroachments\nhave been made by <em>East Enders</em>, another British\nsoap opera, <em>Coronation Street</em> remains the favourite of\nmany.  It caught the attention of Jeffrey Miller, an\nAmerican who went to live in Toronto, where the\nshow airs six days a week, “with an extra half-hour on\n'the Lord's day.' ”  The series is set in Lancashire, and\nMiller has recorded an interesting collection of words\nand phrases used by the characters.  As far as I know,\nhis is the first work devoted to the language of flctional\ncharacters in a television soap opera.  If only one\nout of ten of those who regularly watch <em>Coronation\nStreet</em> were to buy the book, it would be a huge financial\nsuccess.</p>\n<p>In any event, the book is well worth having: the\ndefinitions are encyclopedic and cover many expressions\nthat, as far as I know, are not doucmented elsewhere.\nThere are many photographs, more than half\nin color.  Here is a sample or two:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Flaming Nora!:</em> 'Flippin 'eck!'; or as Americans\nput it, 'Holy cow!' Nora is the Dark Lady of\n<em>Coronation Street</em> vernacular.  The expression has\nbeen used by countless characters, from Elsie\nTanner to Jack Duckworth, yet veteran <em>Street</em>\nscriptwriter H.V. Kershaw admits, 'I have used\nthis phrase many times without any knowledge of\nthe lady.'  Even the peerless scholars of Oxford\nUniversity Press dictionaries can provide no clue\nto Nora's history.</p>\n<p><em>muriel:</em> Hilda Ogden's pronuciation of 'mural.'\nShe has a blow-up of an Alpine scene on her wall.\nMany viewers have written to ask where they\ncould buy one.</p>\n<p><em>worse things happen at sea:</em> 'Cheer up, things\ncould always be worse.'  Hilda once pulled the\nplug on Stan's bath-tub of home-made beer,\nfearing it was against the law.  Stan was\ndevastated.  'Worse things happen at sea,' she\ntold him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It must be said that not all of the entries are\nunfamiliar, and I am not sure why <em>spliced</em> 'married,'\n<em>yammer</em> for 'cry for,' <em>set-to</em> 'argument,' and other\nwell-known slang terms are there.  Also, there are\nfamiliar Briticisms—<em>yobbo</em> (but not <em>boyo</em>), <em>bog</em> 'toilet,'\n<em>duck-egg</em> 'goose-egg,' etc.—which can be found in\nother sources.  But no claim is made for exclusivity of\ncoverage, and if that is how the <em>Street</em> people speak, so\nbe it.  As the author points out in a note, “this book is a\ncompendium of idiomatic British English, mostly Lancashire\nEnglish as, and only as, that language is portrayed\nin the scripts of <em>Coronation Street</em>.”</p>\n<p>To order a copy, send US$12.70 to Street Talk,\nCBC Enterprises, Box 500, Station A, Toronto,\nOntario, Canada M5W 1E6.  Mentioning VERBATIM\nwon't get you a discount, but it will impress the CBC\nand Mr. Miller with the considerable (or negligible)\ninfluence we have on our readers.  In Europe, information\nmay be obtained from Ward Lock Ltd, 8 Clifford\nStreet, London W1X 1RB.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
