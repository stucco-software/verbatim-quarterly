All I have at hand is a popularization\ncalled <em>The World War II Quiz and Fact Book</em>, by T.B.\nBenford (Harper &amp; Row 1982), which says on page 27 that the\n<em>M.c.</em> “got its name from the Finns...in the winter of 1939-40.”</p>\n<p>That isn't good enough.  A book called <em>Men Against Tanks</em>,\nby J. Weeks (Mason/Charter 1975), says on page 31 that the\nSpanish Civil War “produced” the <em>M.c.</em>  This is confirmed by\n<em>Guerilla Warfare</em>, by “Yank” Levy (Penguin 1942, p.33).  However,\nneither is explicit as to the origin of the name itself.</p>\n<p>Can someone produce a clear citation showing the use of\nthe term <em>Molotov cocktail</em> during the Spanish Civil War?</p>\n<h1></h1>",
