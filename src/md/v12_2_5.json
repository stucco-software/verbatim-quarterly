[p. 1]</p>\n<p><em>Nato jets keep Greeks buzzing</em>—Greek planes turn back\nTurkish and US jets from Greek airspace in Nato\nmaneuvers.  [p. 5]</p>\n<p><em>Snakes alive!</em>—Children are forced to flee school\ninvaded by 80 snakes.  [p. 7]</p>\n<p><em>Changing her tune</em>—Chinese opera singer who\ndefected to Taiwan denounces communism.  [p. 8]</p>\n<p><em>Shell shock</em>—French farmers destroy British eggs in\nprice protest.  [p. 6]</p>\n<p><em>Labour of love</em>—Rehabilitation of statue of Eros for\nPiccadilly Circus [p. 3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>England, of course, does not always live up to the\nromantic image of her that is cherished in the bosoms of\nAnglophile Americans.  Chromotrichial punk-rockers with\nspiked hair-dos scarcely turn Londoners' heads any longer—\nnot even the other way; the Englishman's fascination for\nwesterns may even have created a British Cult of the Urbane\nCowboy.  Judging from some of the mischief being done the\nlanguage in what some may regard as a bastion of grammatical\nconservatism (at least!), <em>The Times</em> does have its howlers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither he nor his brother want the police to\ninvestigate the assault because they want to deal with it\nin their own way.  [30 October 1984, p. 35]</p>\n<p>The improved offer to help came after Mr Giorgis's\ncomplaint, accepted by ministers, that the idea of\nsending two Hercules for a month was too short for\nthem to have any impact.  [30 October 1984, p. 1]</p>\n<p>But nobody was more surprised than him... [1\nNovember 1984, p. 14: 'Moreover ... Miles Kington']</p>\n<p>Boyle had hoped to take over this year but has been\ndelayed because of pressure on his centre in Edinburgh,\nwhich has dealt with 700 addicts and deprived\nyoungsters since it opened in August.  [31 October 1984,\np. 12: 'The Times Diary']</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...and, on the subject of multiple negatives:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The court upheld a prosecution appeal against the\ndecision of a London stipendiary magistrate to dismiss a\ncharge of failing to provide a breath specimen brought\nagainst Miss P—H—, aged 20.  [10 October 1984, p. 3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where else in the world could one find the <em>Impact\nSchool of Motoring</em> (Harrow), <em>Headstone Hire</em> (seen on a\nvan on the M-40 motorway), <em>Graham Spittle, Solicitor</em>\n(Berkhamsted), and <em>Silicon Glen</em> (between Ayr and Dundee)?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
