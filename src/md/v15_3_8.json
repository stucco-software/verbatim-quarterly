The principal parent of Yiddish is\nHigh German, the form of German encountered by\nJewish settlers from northern France in the eleventh\ncentury.  Yiddish is written in the characters of the\nHebrew alphabet and from right to left and enjoys\nborrowing words from Russian, Polish, English, and\nall the other languages and countries along the routes\nthat Jews have traveled during the past thousand years.\nJournalist Charles Rappaport once quipped, “I speak\nten languages—all of them Yiddish.”</p>\n<p>Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out\nfor hundreds of years, the language is spoken today by\nmillions of people throughout the world—Russia, Poland,\nRumania, France, England, Israel, Africa,\nLatin America, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and\nthe United States, where, like the bagel, it was leavened\non both coasts, in New York and Hollywood.  It is\nspoken even in Transylvania: A beautiful girl awakens\nin bed to find a vampire at her side.  Quickly she holds\nup a cross. “Zie gernisht helfen,” smiles the vampire.\nTranslation: “It won't do you any good.”</p>\n<p>Most of us already speak a fair amount of Yiddish\n(Yinglish) without fully realizing it.  <em>Webster's Third\nNew International Dictionary</em> lists about 500 Yiddish\nwords that have become part of our everyday conversations,\nincluding:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>cockamamy</em> (or <em>cockamamie</em>) 'mixed-up, ridiculous.'</p>\n<p><em>fin</em> slang for 'five-dollar bill,' from <em>finf</em>, the Yiddish\nword for 'five.'</p>\n<p><em>gun moll</em> a double clipping of <em>gonif's Molly</em>, Yiddish\nfor 'thief's girl.'</p>\n<p><em>kibitzer</em> 'one who comments, often in the form of\nunwanted advice, during a game, often cards.'</p>\n<p><em>mavin</em> 'expert.'</p>\n<p><em>mazuma</em> 'money.'</p>\n<p><em>mish-mosh</em> 'mess.'</p>\n<p><em>schlep</em> to 'drag or haul.'</p>\n<p><em>schlock</em> 'shoddy, cheaply produced merchandise.'</p>\n<p><em>schmeer</em> the 'entire deal,' the 'whole package.'</p>\n<p><em>schnoz</em> slang for 'nose.'</p>\n<p><em>yenta</em> 'blabbermouth, gossip; woman of low\norigins.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... and so on through the whole <em>megillah</em>: 'long,\ninvolved story.'</p>\n<p>A number of poignant Yiddish words defy genuine\ntranslation into English:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>chutzpa</em> 'nerve; unmitigated gall;' a quality we\nadmire within ourselves, but never in others.  In\nhis delightful study, <em>The Joys of Yiddish</em> (McGraw-Hill\n1968), Leo Rosten offers two classic\ndefinitions.  “<em>Chutzpa</em> is that quality enshrined in\na man, who, having killed his mother and father,\nthrows himself on the mercy of the court because\nhe is an orphan.  A <em>chutzpanik</em> may be defined as\nthe man who shouts 'Help!  Help!'  while beating\nyou up.”</p>\n<p><em>mensch</em> a 'real authentic human being—a person.'\n<em>naches</em> the 'glow of pleasure-plus-pride that only\na child can give to its parents': “This is my son,\nthe <em>Doctor</em>!”</p>\n<p><em>oy</em> not so much a word as an entire vocabulary, as\nRosten observes: “can express any emotion, from\ntrivial delight to the blackest woe.”</p>\n<p><em>oy vay; oy vay in mir</em> literally, “Oh, pain,” but, in\nits long or short form, can be used for anything\nfrom condolence to lament:</p>\n<p>On August 6, 1945, the world's first nuclear\nweapon was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.  Two\nhundred and eighty-two thousand human beings\ndied and tens of thousands more were left\nburned, maimed, and homeless.  [Albert] Einstein,\nwhose letter to Roosevelt had initiated the\nAmerican effort that resulted in the atom bomb\nand whose special theory of relativity formed its\ntheoretical basis, heard the news on the radio.\nFor a long time he could only find two Yiddish\nwords traditionally used by Jews in such circumstances:\n“Oi vey.”</p>\n<p>—<em>The Little, Brown Book of Anecdotes</em></p>\n<p><em>tsuris</em> the gamut of painful emotions—some real,\nsome imagined, some self-inflicted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yiddish is especially versatile in describing those\npoor souls who inhabit the world of the ineffectual,\nand each is assigned a distinct place in the gallery of\npathetic types: <em>schmo, schmendrik, schnook, schmegegge,\nschlep, schlub, schmuck, putz, klutz, kvetch</em>,\nand <em>nudnik</em>.  Yiddish easily coins new names for new\npersonalities: a <em>nudnik</em> is a 'pest'; a <em>phudnik</em> is a 'nudnik\nwith a Ph.D.'  The rich nuances that suffuse this\nroll call are seen in the timeless distinction between a\n<em>schlemiel</em> 'clumsy jerk' and a <em>schlimazel</em> 'habitual\nloser': the schlemiel inevitably trips and spills his hot\nsoup—all over the schlimazel.  (And the <em>nebbish</em> is the\none who has to clean it up.)</p>\n<p>The Yiddish language, through its color, its target-accurate\nexpressions, its raw idioms, and its sayings\nexudes a refreshing magic and laughter, mixed with\nsober thought, that has been handed down from generation\nto generation and from nation to nation.  Yiddish\nnever apologizes for what it is—the earthy, wise\nsoul of an expressive people learning that life is but a\nmingled yarn, good and ill together.</p>\n<p>Which reminds us of the <em>zaftig</em> 'buxom, well-rounded'\nblonde who wore an enormous diamond to a\ncharity ball.  “It happens to be the third most famous\ndiamond in the whole world,” she boasted.  “The first is\nthe Hope diamond, then comes the Kohinoor, and then\ncomes this one, which is called the Lipschitz.”</p>\n<p>“What a stone!  How lucky you are!”</p>\n<p>“Wait, wait,” said the lady.  “Nothing in life is all\n<em>mazel</em> ['good luck'].  Unfortunately, with this famous\nLipschitz diamond comes also the famous Lipschitz\ncurse.”</p>\n<p>The other women gasped and asked, “And what is\nthe famous Lipschitz curse?”</p>\n<p>“Lipschitz,” sighed the lady.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
