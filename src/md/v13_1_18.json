With the “information\nexplosion” following WWII, dictionaries assumed a\nrole in society far more important than any they had\never enjoyed earlier; with the increasing application of\ncomputers to sort and analyze the source materials\nused by lexicographers and, later, to drive automatic\ntypesetting devices that made their production considerably\nless expensive than before, dictionaries proliferated,\ncreating work for those who have well-organized\nminds and a sufficient measure of assiduity\nto sustain them in the often wearying plod from A to\nZ.  Even respectable linguists have come forth in the\npast forty years to confess their interest and involvement\nin lexicography.  In the late 1950s, the number of\nfull-time, active, professional lexicographers working\nin the English language numbered about half a dozen,\nbut that, of course, excluded the editors who worked\non pronunciation, etymology, definition, and the various\nother elements that go to make up the information\ncontained in monolingual dictionaries; at a recent\nmeeting of Euralex, the European Association of Lexicographers\n(which has members everywhere), there\nwere about 350 participants.

That is\nstill a relatively small clique, but clearly an enormous\nincrease over any earlier estimates.  Lexicography is a\nprofession like any other: it demands a thorough background\nin many aspects of a highly specialized and\noften abstruse subject (linguistics) as well as an artistic\nability with language combined with a systematic turn\nof mind.  The creative, artistic imagination of the lexicographer\nto a great extent helps determine his proficiency,\njust as those attributes serve as criteria for\ntruly proficient doctors, lawyers, engineers, and people\nin other professions.</p>\n<p>There are good, mediocre, and bad dictionaries,\nthough the critic, in classifying them, ought always be\naware of any constraints of cost and market that might\nhave been imposed by the publisher.  Works of fiction\nand other works of nonfiction are either good or bad,\nand publishers seldom interfere with their scope or\nlength; reference books are another matter: publishers\nusually set budgets for them, and the sales managers of\npublishing companies often impose strict guidelines of\npage length and format, for many dictionaries are tailored\nto particular markets.</p>\n<p>Of the many companies that have published dictionaries,\nonly a handful maintain a regular, full-time\nstaff devoted to the continued tracking of the language,\nthe updating and revision of dictionaries that\nare kept in print, and a regular program of publication\nof new works.  Thus, there have sprung up a few\nindependent, professional compilers of dictionaries\nand, usually, other kinds of reference books who are\nemployed by companies wishing to publish or revise a\nspecific work.  In general, originating a new dictionary\nor revising an existing one is an expensive undertaking.\n<em>Webster's Third Unabridged,</em> which cost about $3.5\nmillion to prepare in 1961, would probably cost several\ntimes that today; even by its publication date in\n1966, the <em>Random House Unabridged,</em> about half the\nsize of <em>Webster's Third,</em> had cost some $3.5 million,\nand its revision alone would probably cost that much\ntoday.</p>\n<p>From all those millions, one might expect that lexicographers\nare pretty well off.  The facts, alas, are\nquite different: many publishers who yield, however\nreluctantly, to paying considerable amounts to compositors\nand printers and paper manufacturers for the\nproduction of a major dictionary become unconscionably\npenurious when it comes to paying lexicographers.\nMoreover, contrary to popular opinion, lexicographers\nalmost never receive royalties on the sales of copies of\nthe better-selling dictionaries, though they are able,\nnow and then, to make royalty deals on lesser works,\nespecially, outside of the United States.</p>\n<p>A major dictionary is a very profitable enterprise\nfor the publisher who succeeds in establishing it in the\nmarketplace, hence, the dictionary has become an\ninstitutionalized money-spinner for some of them.  An\nAmerican college dictionary, for instance, could sell\nbetween 300,000 and 500,000 copies a year, which is\nquite respectable.  On the other hand, such dictionaries\nare very competitively priced: just think of the average\nnovel of about 300 pages (about 200,000 words) selling\nfor $20.00; then consider the average college dictionary\nof about 1700 pages (about 3,000,000 words) involving\nan investment in the seven figures and selling for\n$15.00; it requires little calculation, taking into account\nthe useful life of the dictionary—roughly ten years—to\nrealize that such books are the biggest bargain on earth.</p>\n<p><em>Lexicography</em> barely touches on these matters,\nnor, indeed, do I suggest that it should.  It is an interesting\nand well-edited “report” of a Colloquium held\nin London in September 1984.  Fifty-four invited lexicographers\nand lexicographic groupies from thirteen\ncountries met, gave papers, commented on papers,\nand exchanged ideas under the auspices of the United\nStates-United Kingdom Educational (Fulbright) Commission.\nI attended an earlier planning session organized\nby Professor Sir Randolph Quirk, then Vice-Chancellor\nof the University of London, the entire\nevent having been thought up by John Herrington,\noutgoing Executive Director; the Colloquium and this\nbook are a tribute to him and to the many years of\nwork he did in London in behalf of the Fulbright\nCommission.</p>\n<p>The papers, which are interesting and useful—not\nthe usual turgid academic gobbledegook foisted on\nscholars who convene mainly to give their own papers\nrather than hear others'—range from a few on the history\nof lexicography, the training (but not the care\nand feeding) of lexicographers (and users!), some blue-sky\nprojections, “Dictionaries of the next century”\n(Professor Richard W. Bailey, University of Michigan),\nand a number of “Final” recommendations\nand concluding remarks by Dr. Gabriele Stein and\nHerrington.</p>\n<p>The book is eminently readable, thanks both to\nthe sensible papers of the participants and to the judicious\nediting by Ilson, no mean lexicographer himself.\nIf you want to read about some of the matters that\ncommand the attention of lexicographers and those\ninvolved in lexicography, you couldn't find a better\nintroduction to their concerns.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
