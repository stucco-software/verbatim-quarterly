Garner</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Austin, Texas</span></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“So now they have made our English tongue a\ngallimaufry or hodgepodge of all other speeches.”â\nEdmund Spenser</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I know that some will say it is a mingle tongue.\nAnd why not so much the better, taking the best of\nboth and the other?”âPhilip Sidney</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The etymological potpourri that we know as the English\nlanguage has unquestionably benefited from the diversity\nof its sources.  In the Renaissance, writers of English freely\nborrowed foreign wordsâmostly from Latin, French, and\nGreekâwhen they sensed lacunae in our word-stock.  Thus\nWilliam Caxton, who introduced printing into English in 1477,\nis credited in the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> with the first use\nof <em>abjure, admiration, affability, apparition, calumnious, capacity,\ncontumelious, desperate, factor, ingenious, inhuman, nuptial,\nquasi, seduce, sumptuous</em>, and <em>turpitude</em>.  Other of\nCaxton's loanwords have not fared so well: for example,\n<em>exsidion</em> 'extirpation' (a nonce-word), <em>exercite</em> 'army,' <em>magistration</em>\n'command' (also a nonce-word).  Sir Thomas Elyot, the\ngreat early 16th-century word-borrower, also had his lexical\nsuccesses <em>(animate, attraction, education, excrement, exterior,\nfrugality, irritate, persist, ruminate</em>) as well as his failures\n<em>(allective, applicate, assentatour)</em>.</p>\n<p>Amid the xenophilic inundation of the English lexicon\nduring this period, however, many words were brought into the\nlanguage not so much to fill gaps as to satisfy particular writers'\npenchants for the far-fetched.  Our historical dictionaries contain\na superabundance of strange and ridiculous formations\n(many of which appeared only once in the language), coined by\nfervent neologists with little or no sense of the lexical exigencies\nof the time.</p>\n<p>One such ridiculous word, which surfaced late in the\nRenaissance, is <em>celeripedian</em> (Latin <em>celer</em> 'swift' + <em>ped</em>- 'foot'),\nmeaning 'swift footman.'  Henry Cockeram recorded the word\nin his <em>English Dictionarie</em> of 1623.  In fact, Cockeram very\nlikely coined <em>celeripedians</em>, as at least 200 obsolete verbs are\nknown only through that work.  Cockeram's brand of whimsical\nlexicographic invention (almost an oxymoron) was short-lived,\nto the credit of subsequent dictionary makers.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, as a result of copious borrowing and because of\nthe affinities of Indo-European languages, words composed of\nanalogous etymological elements began to crop up in English.\nSome of these were calques, or loan-translations, arrived at\nconsciously by analogical agglutination.  Thus Dan Michel's\nFrench work <em>Remorse of Conscience</em> was translated anonymously\nin approximately 1340 under an analogous title:\n<em>Ayenbite of Inwyt</em>.  Dickens, in an essay entitled “The Growth\nof English Words,” described the calques in Wycliffe's version\nof the New Testament:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes Wycliffe employs a Latin word, as Resurrection,\nat other times he translates it, the Agen-rysynge\n(or again-rising); so also the word Except appears as\nOut-taken, thus, Out-taken women and children, for\nExcept women and children.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Doubtless many etymological equivalents, unlike those in\nWycliffe's writings, arose unconsciously.  It is often difficult in a\ngiven case to trace whether the Anglo-Saxon analogue was\narrived at purposely or inadvertently.  The best clues occur\nwhere an author uses the Romance term and then glosses it\nwith the Saxon equivalent; some authors actually refer to their\nneologizing and attempt to rationalize it.  In other instances it\nseems that the affinities of Indo-European languages, in conjunction\nwith rampant borrowing, gave rise to the creation of\netymological analogues.  It is interesting to note that, whether\nor not consciously derived, many of these analogues, having\ncoexisted in English for many centuries, retain the same basic\nmeaning, while others have, to varying degrees, been differentiated\nin meaning.  In some instances the connection seems quite\nremote.</p>\n<p>What follows is a small compilation of etymological synonyms\nin English.  One finds that the words composed of the\nrarer analogues have generally retained similar senses close to\nroot meanings.  Those composed of more common morphemes\nhave often strayed from the literal meanings, so that the\nanalogous formations now bear little resemblance to one\nanother.</p>\n<p>Whether the etymological synonyms have diverged or\nremained constant in meaning, it is useful to enhance our\nawareness of equivalences in English affixes and roots, for we\nthereby acquire a greater sensitivity to our language, its origins,\nand its nuances.  The list should illustrate a point made by\nColeridge more than a hundred fifty years ago:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It may be doubted whether a composite language like\nthe English is not a happier instrument of expression\nthan a homogeneous one like the German.  We possess\na wonderful richness and variety of modified meanings\nin our Saxon and Latin quasi-synonyms, which the\nGermans have not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the three columns listed below, such etymological\nanalogues as are attested are matched horizontally, showing\nderivatives from Greek, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon elements,\nrespectively.  It may be worth pointing out that although\ncompound words made up of certain elements of another\nlanguage exist in English, the “mother tongue” did not\nnecessarily contain the compounded form, i.e., the compounding\nwas done in English or French.</p>\n<p>| GREEK                     | LATIN                        | ANGLO-SAXON          |\n| ------------------------- |
