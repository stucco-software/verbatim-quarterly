In the small\ncommunity hospital where I teach and practice hematology\nand oncology, I frequently struggle to decode\nthe abbreviations and acronyms used by house\nstaff and medical students.  While this process is\nfrustrating at times, certain abbreviations and acronyms\nadd humor to the atmosphere of busy and\nstressful day-to-day medical practice.  For example,\nwhile we often say that a patient needs lots of <em>TLC</em>\n“Tender Loving Care,' at times we end up seeing the\nresult of another <em>TLC</em>—'Total Lack of Concern.'\nMany of us, including me, use <em>WNL</em> for 'Within Normal\nLimits' to describe the results of various x-ray\nand laboratory tests; however, at times we find this\nmay well mean 'We Never Looked.' When <em>NMR</em>\n'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,' which is now better\nreferred to as <em>MRI</em> 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging,'\nwas first introduced to the medical community,\nmany consumer advocates and insurance people,\nfearing the escalating health-care costs associated\nwith this expensive diagnostic procedure, thought a\nbetter translation would be 'No More Radiologists.'\n<em>DRG</em> 'Diagnosis Related Group,' the term Uncle\nSam uses to describe prospective payment to a hospital,\ncould mean 'Damned Regulatory Government'\nto the medical profession or 'De [The] Revenues\nGone' to the hospital administration.</p>\n<p>For those of us in medicine, we all carry a title\n<em>M.D</em>.  'Doctor of Medicine.'  When I was drafted into\nthe U.S. Army as a Medical Officer, my title was\n“Dal Yoo, M.D., U.S.A. (United States Army)” and I\nrecall my Master Sergeant's morbid joke that <em>M.D.</em>,\n<em>U.S.A.</em> could stand for 'Many Die and U Shall Also.'\nSpeaking of various titles, M.D.s are not the only\nones who get the bad names.  <em>B.S.</em> 'Bachelor of Science'\ncould well mean 'bullshit'; <em>M.S.</em> 'More of the\nSame,' and <em>Ph.D.</em> 'Pile Higher and Deeper,' etc.</p>\n<p>In the field of medical laboratory testing, you\nmay remember a test called the <em>SIA</em> for detecting\nabnormal macroglobulin in the serum.  The test is\nperformed by putting a drop of serum into distilled\nwater, producing a grossly visible white precipitate\nin patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia\nand other dysproteinemic disorders.  Dr. Walden-strom\nsome years ago told me that he had an opportunity\nto meet Dr. Sia, a Chinese physician who first\nintroduced this simple bedside technique to medicine.\nHowever, when I was in West Germany, this\n<em>SIA</em> test was labeled as 'Serum In Aqua.'  Another\nexample comes from <em>VIP</em> 'Vasoactive Intestinal Poly-peptide.'\nThis assay was quite variable from laboratory\nto laboratory when first introduced; thus it\nmeant 'Very Inconsistent Polypeptide' to some of\nthe gastroenterologists and surgeons who were pondering\nthe possibility of pancreatic surgery in patients\nwith high levels of <em>VIP</em>.</p>\n<p>These abbreviations and acronyms are generating\nlaughter in day-to-day life as well as in the medical\nfield.  Some time ago, I heard that President\nBush's budget proposal was <em>DOA</em> 'Dead On Arrival'\non the congressional floor.  However, President\nBush's interpretation of <em>DOA</em> was 'Defining Opportunity\nfor America.'  More recently, during the war\nin the Gulf we saw both pro- and anti-war demonstrations,\nthus generating <em>SMASH</em> 'Students Mobilized\nAgainst Saddam Hussein,' as well as <em>SCUD</em>\n'Sadly Confused Unpatriotic Demonstrators.'  At\ntimes abbreviations or acronyms get upside-down as\nwell as backward meanings.  In President Carter's\ndays, when inflation was sky high, Democrats used\nthe slogan <em>WIN</em> 'Whip Inflation Now'; Republicans\nturned the <em>WIN</em> button upside down, making it <em>NIM</em>\n'No Immediate Miracle.'  For the backward example,\nI saw the sign for <em>DAM</em> which is supposed to\nrepresent 'Mothers Against Dyslexia.'</p>\n<p>When I first visited Philadelphia to plan my future\npostgraduate training, a local acquaintance gave\nme a quick city tour which included the worldfamous\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art.  The windows\nof the museum gave some nice views of downtown\nPhiladelphia.  The visit was in early summer when\nongoing road pavement work was generating strong\nsmells.  From the museum window we could see a\nneon sign with <em>PSFS</em> in bright letters on one of the\nhigh-rise downtown buildings.  The letters stood for\n'Philadelphia Savings Fund Society' but on that day I\ntold my local guide that they stood, more appropriately,\nfor 'Philadelphia Smells Funny Sometimes.'\nHowever, I later fell in love with this city of brotherly\nlove, not only for its excellent medical training\nbut also for its rich metropolitan atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Speaking of smells, we have the organization\ncalled <em>NOSE</em> in the Washington suburban area\nwhich, as you may have guessed, stands for 'Neighbors\nOrganization for Stench Elimination.'  <em>NOSE</em> is\nfighting for the beautification of residential housing\ndistricts.  Like everything else, the meaning of certain\nabbreviations or acronyms could vary depending\non the observer.  The Belgian airline called\n<em>SABENA</em> could stand for 'Such A Bad Experience—\nNever Again' but also could mean 'Such a Beautiful\nExperience—Never Alone.'  Indeed we do not seem\nto be able to get away from numerous abbreviations\nand acronyms every day of our lives because newspapers,\nmagazines, and TV newscasts love to come\nup with new and innovative ones.  The latest scandal\nof the television ministry concerns the organization\nknown as <em>PTL</em>, which is supposed to stand for 'Praise\nThe Lord' or 'People That Love'; others think it\nmeans 'Pass The Loot.'  In this era of the litigationprone\nsociety, including the high rate of malpractice\nsuits, I noted an organization called, <em>HALT</em> 'Help\nAbolish Legal Tyranny.' I welcome any means of\nbringing laughter into bedside medicine, which we\nall think of as the last place where one could ever\nfind any decent humor.  When the medical practice\ngets tough, particularly for those truly complicated\ncases where I have no idea what the patient has, I\napply my favorite of all the abbreviations, <em>GOK</em> syndrome\n'God Only Knows.'</p>\n<p>[Dr. Yoo would like to hear from readers who have heard or seen\noutrageous abbreviations or acronyms.  Address him at: Dal Yoo,\nM.D., FACP/Director of Education/Hematology/Oncology Section/Providence\nHospital/Washington, D.C. 20017-2180.]</p>\n<h1></h1>",
