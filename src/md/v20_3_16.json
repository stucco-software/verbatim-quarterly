This is an important book, one that ought to be read especially by those who disagree with its points of view. Instead of taking issue with the matters raised, it would be more revealing and useful to list the chapter headings: Introduction: Who Gives a Damn?; 1, Good or Bad?; 2, Attitudes; 3, Swearing; 4, Slang; 5, Sort of Meaningless?; 6, Right or Wrong?; 7, Bad Accents; 8, Change or Decay?; 9, Bad Language and Education; 10, Moral. My complaint about the Moral is that it says little more than, “There's nothing either good or bad: thinking makes it so,” a truism that all except the most devout can accept. The one topic I was unable to find is appropriateness, the lack of which is the source of much of the prejudice certain speakers encounter: we do not expect four-letter words to appear in a presidential address to the Congress or in the Queen's at the opening of Parliament, but their use in the changing rooms of football teams does not seem out of order. Have we not the right to expect more ordered, carefully worded, well-thought-out, and sophisticated organization of language in formal situations? Should not the newsreader for the major CBS affiliate in Hartford, Connecticut, be able to pronounce <em>mastectomy</em> instead of saying “massectomy” (as she did (twice) on July 14th) and to know the difference between <em>lie and lay</em>? Have we not the right to expect some measure of refinement of expression from those who expect our respect?</p>\n<p>Such may not be a popular view among linguists in the closing years of the 20th century, but it does, I think, express the opinion of a far greater number of users of the language—even those who may not regard their own speech as unflawed—than can be mustered by those who pay lip service to language liberalism but rarely talk that way themselves because “it is not their idiolect.” As I have written many times in these pages, there is nothing inherently evil in the use of nonstandard language, and the inability to express oneself artistically is not reprehensible. The linguist may view all aspects of language clinically, but when he accepts the ambiguity stemming from a misplaced modifier as equivalent to the clarity of a properly worded sentence, we have a standard against which the linguist's performance must be judged. Essentially, it comes down to the fact that we do not mind having linguists around to theorize about language and write recondite articles in obscure journals about the arcana of language— we simply do not want them teaching language to our children.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
