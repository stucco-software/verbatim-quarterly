But Bill Bryson\nworks as one for no less a paper than <em>The Times</em>, and that gives\nhim exceptional qualifications for compiling <em>The Penguin Dictionary\nof Troublesome Words</em>.

So he ought to be a reliable guide\nthrough the minefields of contemporary usage in English and\nAmerican.  And, up to a point, Sir William, he is.  He knows\nonly too well that writers aiming at trendiness or emphasis are\napt to hit more magpies than bulls, and he is right to hoist a\nred flag of warning over <em>fortuitous, flaunt</em> and <em>flounder</em>, over\n<em>straitjacket</em> and <em>co-equal</em>, and over a score of spellings that trip\nup the unwary.</p>\n<p>Difficulties in following Mr. Bryson arise, however, when\nhe moves out from the subeditor's legitimate sphere of helping\nwriters to say what they intended and starts trying to legislate\nfor the language more generally.  Things get worse—and one\ncan only sympathize with cub reporters on <em>The Times</em>—as it\nbecomes clear that his policy is an odd mixture of liberal\n<em>laissez-faire</em> and conservative dogmatism.  On the number of\n<em>data</em>, for instance, Mr. Bryson is prepared, after carefully\nweighing pros and cons, to pass the singular.  He sets aside the\nprotests of purists, explaining that “in English usage etymology\ndoesn't always count for much.”  How often is “not always,”\nthough?  Well, Mr. Bryson won't accept <em>trivia</em> as a singular,\nshould we happen to want to use the word, because “there is\nno singular form.”  As well as Latin grammatical niceness,\nancient dramatic practice is invoked.  Though we are to be\nallowed any number of antagonists (despite <em>nec quarta loqui\npersona laboret</em>), <em>protagonist</em> cannot, we are solemnly informed,\nproperly be applied to more than one person.  Perhaps so, but\nwill that argument change anybody's linguistic habits in the\ntwentieth century?</p>\n<p>Similar points can be made about several of Mr. Bryson's\nobservations.  For all of us who like to identify words on the\nwing there is something of interest in the reminder that\n“epidemic” is related to “democracy” and so originally referred\nonly to diseases afflicting the human race.  But nobody ought to\nbe worried that the meaning of the word has stretched over the\ncenturies.  Certainly <em>epizootic</em>, which Mr. Bryson appears to\nfavor, cannot look forward to a bright future.  English does not\nneed the discrimination that term would offer, even if it were\nnot doomed because there would always be confusion over its\npronunciation.  Academic principle rules again in the comment\nthat <em>flak</em> should never be given a c before the k because it is a\ncontraction derived from <em>Fliegerabwehrkanone</em>.  True enough,\nbut it is by no means unprecedented for English to modify the\nspelling of a word as it borrows it and bends its meaning.\nBesides, the form <em>flak-jacket</em>, which is frequently needed in\nreports of embassy sieges and the like, simply looks too much\nlike a misprint to survive for long.  The truth of the matter, as\nMr. Bryson admits when he quotes his colleague Philip Howard,\nis that etymology demonstrably does not control the\ndevelopment of a word once it has been launched.</p>\n<p>What is more useful than complaining that words change\nis exploring how they develop and why.  Change is not\nsynonymous with decay, and if there is rot, only good example\nwill stop it, not pedantic precept.  There is, to be sure, a good\ndeal of slipshod writing around, but Mr. Bryson is unlikely to\nwin friends or influence people by displaying scant sensitivity\nto the modern tongue.  It is true that we managed with just\n<em>weather</em> for a long time.  Nowadays, <em>weather conditions</em> are\nwhat people sometimes talk about.  Is that just fashion?  The\ntelecasters urge for pompous polysyllables?  Perhaps.  But it\nprobably also reflects some growing awareness of the interplay\nof atmospheric forces that bring the showers.  <em>Weather</em> may\nhave been good enough for shepherds hoping for red skies at\nnight, but isobars and satellite pictures suggest <em>weather conditions</em>.\nAgain, accountants know quite as well as Mr. Bryson\nwhat is meant by <em>anticipated income</em>, so we had better agree\nthat there must be some reason why company chairmen are\nregularly allowed to write that the firm had not “anticipated\nlosses on its underwriting operations.”  The word conveys\nrather more than just <em>expect</em>, implying, it appears, something\nabout taking appropriate steps.</p>\n<p>Many of Mr. Bryson's difficulties stem from his overrespectful\nattitude to dictionaries.  He sees them as prescribing\nusage, rather than describing it, though it is only the latter role\nthat gives them validity.  His position is shown in a long\nparagraph on <em>warn</em>.  He quotes a sentence from the <em>Daily\nTelegraph</em>: “British Rail warned that snow was bound to have a\nserious effect on its service today.”  The meaning is perfectly\nclear, but Mr. Bryson becomes very uneasy on discovering no\nauthority for this intransitive use of the verb, even though he\nconsiders the distinction rather fussy.  He concludes with the\ndisturbing thought that those who use it “do so at the peril of\nbeing called incorrect.”  It is hard to think there is any real risk.\nBut the caution is typical of Mr. Bryson, who is always fretting\nabout being caught out in some impropriety in what he\nvariously calls formal, careful, and serious situations.  Worse\nstill, he can be snobbish towards those he considers less well\neducated than himself.  There may often be a touch of irony, a\nsort of verbal glorious Technicolor, when people insist on\npronouncing as many syllables as possible in “Ye olde worlde\nteashoppe.”  Even if there isn't, there is no need to administer a\nmagisterial put-down, as Alexander taught Marcus Aurelius a\nvery long time ago.</p>\n<p><em>Christopher Smith, Norwich, Norfolk</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
