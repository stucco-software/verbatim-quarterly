(Incidentally, <em>flavorfully</em> and <em>flatterer</em> have\nnever appeared as headwords in any of our dictionaries, and I\ncannot imagine why you would say they have.)  Since, in\n1953, our major competitor had a far lower vocabulary count\nthan our own—c. 130,000 vs. 142,000—we felt no need to\npad the figure with such entries or run-ins as <em>mythologization</em>\nor <em>permeableness</em>, as in, for example, <em>The Random House\nCollege Dictionary</em>.
