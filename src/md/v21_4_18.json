Inevitably, a large percentage of questions received could have been answered by referring to a dictionary, even a relatively modest work. But some have dealt with subtler matters, and, in some cases, questions relating to details of the language not readily derivable even from the massive <em>OED</em>, in either of its editions.</p>\n<p>In this book, the editors have occasionally undertaken to answer questions that have not been asked specifically but might reasonably be anticipated, like, “What is the difference between American and British English?” As they acknowledge, the subject is huge, not encompassable within the six or so pages given over to it here; the main areas are touched upon—pronunciation, spelling, vocabulary, and a bit on grammer—which is all one might expect in a brief work. Still, it would have been wise to have consulted a (knowledgeable) native speaker of American English before setting forth the misinformation about some differences in vocabulary. For instance, <em>adrenalin</em> is also the common term in <em>AE</em> (not <em>epinephrine</em>), though the latter is known; <em>BE</em> <em>bath</em> can be <em>tub</em> in <em>AE</em> but is usually <em>bathtub</em>; an <em>AE</em> <em>cookie</em> is a <em>BE</em> <em>sweet biscuit</em>, but biscuit is a common alternative term in AE for a dry cracker (Remember <em>Uneeda Biscuits</em>? They are crackers.); Americans <em>bring up</em> their children, as the British do, but they also <em>raise</em> or <em>rear</em> them; AE has both <em>curtains</em> and <em>drapes</em>, but they are different things: BE uses <em>curtains</em> for what AE speakers call <em>drapes</em>; AE has both <em>deck chair</em> and <em>beach chair</em>, not, as implied, the latter instead of the former; likewise, AE has <em>dressing gown</em> as well as <em>robe</em> and <em>bathrobe</em>, but a dressing gown is more likely to be somewhat fancier; Americans know many games of <em>solitaire</em>, of which <em>patience</em> is just one; both <em>crayfish</em> and <em>crawfish</em> are used in AE, and it is about time that the old (British) fiction that Americans say <em>railroad</em> for what the British call a <em>railway</em> was put to rest: for at least two generations, one of the biggest companies in the US was called <em>Railway Express</em>. Other fables are perpetuated, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BRITISH AMERICAN COMMENT</p>\n<p>a quarter to a quarter of five AE has both</p>\n<p>five</p>\n<p>a quarter past a quarter after AE has both</p>\n<p>five five</p>\n<p>apart from aside from AE has both</p>\n<p>at school in school AE has both</p>\n<p>behind (in) back of AE has both</p>\n<p>different different than See note 1</p>\n<p>from <em>or</em> to</p>\n<p>have got have See note 2</p>\n<p>have not got do not have See note 2</p>\n<p>I have just I just ate AE has both</p>\n<p>eaten</p>\n<p>in the street on the street AE has both</p>\n<p>teach 'be a teach school AE has both</p>\n<p>teacher'</p>\n<p>up to and through AE has both</p>\n<p>including</p>\n<p>(have a) wash up See note 3</p>\n<p>wash, get</p>\n<p>washed</p>\n<p>Notes: 1. The preferred form in AE is <em>different from</em>, the alternative is <em>different than</em>; in BE, the preferred form is also <em>different from</em>, but the alternative is <em>dif ferent to</em>.</p>\n<p>2. In both AE, and BE, these appear as contractions. The forms <em>I've got money and I've got no money (or I haven't got any money)</em> are far more common in AE than <em>I have money</em> and either <em>I have no money</em> or <em>I don't have money</em>, though I believe that AE speakers might detect a difference in emphasis: <em>I have money</em> is more likely to be said after someone else has said <em>I haven't any money, I've not got any money</em>, or <em>I don't have (any) money</em> when confronted with having to pay for something, as in <em>That's okay, I have money</em>.</p>\n<p>3. AE speakers are less likely to say, <em>I'm going to have a wash; but they certainly do say I'm going to wash up (before dinner)</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem with the way these distinction have been presented is that the BE speaker might be unlikely to use the forms listed under AMERICAN, but what is implied, incorrectly, is that the AE speaker does not use those listed under BRITISH, which is incorrect.</p>\n<p>The information provided in response to real questions is less controversial. In some instances, the questioner might have been better served by being referred to another source. For instance, those who are curious about collective nouns (like <em>gaggle of geese, pride of lions</em>) are referred to Ruth Rendell's <em>An Unkindness of Ravens</em> and James Lipton's <em>An Exaltation of Larks</em>, but no mention is made of Ivan G. Speakes's <em>Dictionary of Collective Nouns</em>, Gale Research Company, 1975, which is not only the most comprehensive work on the subject but provides citations, as well. And it might be worth noting in answer to the query about <em>flammable/inflammable</em> that <em>inflammable</em> is no longer legal on labels in the US because of the ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Many people want to know if tomatoes, bananas, etc., are vegetables, fruits, plants, trees, herbs—or what. Yet there are some questions that are becoming almost universal: with the disappearance of telephone dials, do we <em>enter, key, punch in</em>, or (still) <em>dial</em> a number? It is also useful to have the longish note in response to a query about the universal applicability of “<em>i</em> before <em>e</em> except after <em>c</em>.” There are similar questions answered in the section entitled Curious and Interesting Facts, and the chapter called I've Made Up a Word contains some interesting material. But the replies given to some questions are not entirely satisfactory, as in the case of <em>Why is there no separate plural for the names of many animals</em>? Here, the answer should have touched on the fact that in some cases a plural like <em>fishes</em>, as distinct from the plural <em>fish</em>, sreves to identify the existence of a number of varieties.</p>\n<p>In sum, this must be construed as a mixed review. Perhaps we are grumpier than usual because the two-volume <em>Grammar of the English Language</em>, by George O. Curme, Verbatim Books, (which is more comprehensive than <em>A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language</em>, by Quirk, Greenbaum, et al.), and VERBATIM itself are omitted from the section called Suggestions for Further Reading. At least the <em>Oxford Thesaurus</em> is included.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
