As for\n<em>viejo verde</em>, as in all the Romance languages, 'green' here\nmeans 'still vigorous' and not necessarily 'lascivious,' although\na still-vigorous man might well be lascivious.</p>\n<p><em>Essere al verde</em> 'to be broke' exists equally in French as\n<em>être au vert</em>.  In French, <em>eminence</em> takes the acute accent, thus\n<em>éminence.  Gris</em> 'slightly drunk' is a lighter gradation of <em>noir</em>\n'drunk,' and also applies to other types of intoxication.  <em>Faire\ngrise mine</em> á is <em>faire grise mine á</em>; and <em>browned-off</em> would seem\nto have scatalogical connotations.  Otherwise, thanks for an\ninteresting and provocative article.</p>\n<p><em>[Gerald Kamber, Simsbury, Connecticut]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
