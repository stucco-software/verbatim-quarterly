These are matters of\nsnob appeal — like our <em>Paris belts, Hai Karate</em>, and <em>English\nLeather</em> toiletries for men or shops like <em>Picadilly, Via Veneto</em>,\nand <em>Rive Gauche</em> — and serve in merchandising and advertising\nproducts and services.

After all, as every traveler knows, there are\n<em>snack bars</em> and <em>jeans</em> (not to mention a <em>jeanseria</em>, a shop in Via\nBalbi in Genoa).  <em>Product manager, account executive, art\ndirector</em> and <em>design engineer</em> are common in advertisements offering\njobs.  And the drug culture has assimilated <em>trippare</em> 'to be\ntripping on drugs.'</p>\n<p><em>[D.D. Paige, Middletown, Connecticut]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
