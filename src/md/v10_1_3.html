<p>At the age of fifteen, George Washington wrote his “Rules
of Civility” (1747), which included the following admonition,
“In Speaking to men of Quality, do not lean nor look them full
in the face.”  This was not the first advice that Americans got
on the etiquette of oral and written language, for books on
manners and morals had long been in heavy demand from both
European and domestic authors.  Arthur Schlesinger in <em>Learning
How to Behave</em> (1947) summarizes the advice of pre-Civil
War writers on language etiquette as follows, “When conversing...pains
should be taken not to remind one's companions
of their plebeian origins....  On the other hand, you mustn't
put on airs....”  Such democracy, however, did not extend to
the use of dialects.  The author of <em>The Habits of Good Society</em>
(1858) (“A matron”), advised, “Good society uses the same
language everywhere, and dialects ought to be got rid of in
those who would frequent it....  Localism is not patriotism,
and therefore until the Union is dissolved, we must request
people to talk English in English society.”  On the other hand
she argued that dropping “that eighth letter of our alphabet” is
far better than bad grammar.</p>
<p>Though no pre-Civil War book of etiquette that I have
seen prescribes conversational guidelines between whites and
blacks, a 1937 study reconstructs what they must have been.
Bertram W. Doyle in <em>The Etiquette of Race Relations</em> in the
<em>South</em> (1937) notes that “in some instances, if addressed by the
master, the servant might enter into the conversation 'as if he
were a family friend, better informed on some local and
domestic points' than the master.  He did not, however, initiate
or enter into a conversation unless addressed.”  In private, there
were undoubtedly exceptions to the above, but when several
whites were gathered, blacks generally stood, hat in hand, and
remained silent.</p>
<p>While social intercourse between whites and blacks was
apparently ignored by the standard bearers of etiquette, the
discourse of young ladies was not.  In 1859 Miss Elisa Leslie
offered some very specific advice concerning “the phraseology
of females,” who had evidently fallen under the influence of
“nurses and servants.”  Miss Leslie suggests that one avoid
“monstrous glad” when one means “very glad”; avoid “turn
out the tea” when one means “pour the tea,” and avoid “braid
the eggs” when one means “beat” them.  The list below
summarizes her advice.</p>

| snooze                             | nap                                 |

<p>The post-Civil War era saw prescribers of etiquette turning
much of their attention to affected elegance, though certain
indelicacies were still proscribed.  Schlesinger summarizes the
post-war advice saying that long words, high-sounding phrases,
“and other ways of showing off should be sternly repressed if
one wish[es] to avoid the <em>faux pas</em> of the lady who, being asked
whether she had seen the Dardanelles while abroad, replied,
'Oh, yes; we dined with them several times.' ”</p>
<p>Concerning the use of slang during this time, Richard A.
Wells in <em>Manners, Culture</em>, and <em>Dress</em> (1894) counsels that “all
slang is vulgar” and should not be mistaken as “a substitute for
wit,” for it lowers “the tone of society and the standard of
thought.”  Concerning the double entendre, “A well-bred person
always refuses to understand a phrase of double meaning.”
Should one chance to hear an indelicate word, “Then not the
shadow of a smile should flit across the lips.”  And should a
gentleman converse with a lady, he should pay her “the
compliment of seeming to consider [her] capable of an equal
understanding with gentlemen.”</p>
<p>Such condescension receives some comeuppance in Francis
W. Crowninshield's <em>Manners for the Metropolis</em> (1908).
Crowninshield, who edited <em>Vanity Fair</em> for many years and
who was an urbane member of New York society, nimbly and
succinctly deflates the stuffed-shirt snobbery and pretensions of
the smart set.  Among his ironic aphoristic pieces of advice are
“Try to remember that there are only two kinds of plays and
novelsâthey are either 'bully' or 'rotten,' ” and, “It is not
modish to speak kindly to the servants....  In addressing them,
simply say: 'Where the devil are my boots?'...Remember
that they get even' in the servants' hall.”  Tongue in cheek,
Crowninshield advises finally that a man should avoid calling
the wine “the fizz,” and his wife “his mother.”  Other phrases
to be dutifully avoided are “Pardon my glove” and “Pray rest
your cane.”</p>
<p>Following the First World War, there was a great relaxed
sigh that permeated the stuffest of etiquette books, which
continued to be in demand; over sixty were published in the
1920s alone.</p>
<p>As typical of the new relaxed mood, Schlesinger cites the
following as representative, “As for men swearing before ladies,
one college youth adjured his fellows, 'Try not to,' while
another observed, 'If they say <em>damn</em>, so do I, when useful.”'
Still, while some post-war guides sanctioned <em>swell, sweetie pie,
taxi, flivver, movies, hunch, flapper</em>, and <em>the blues</em>, others
remained quite prescriptive.  The list below, drawn from Martens's
<em>The Book of Good Manners</em>, Richardson's <em>Standard
Etiquette</em>, and Eichler's <em>The New Book of Etiquette</em>, all published
during the 1920s, gives a representative sample of words
and phrases to be avoided.</p>

<p>Frederick H. Martens in <em>The Book of Good Manners</em>
(1924) goes a step beyond the above general proscriptions and
forbids the following “vulgar elegancies”: <em>alleviated poverty,
banquet, effluvium, felicitate, lassitudinous, lineament, liquid
refreshment</em>, and <em>ventilate</em> in the sense of 'explain.'</p>
<p>Since the 1930s, writers of etiquette books have generally
avoided specific recommendations of diction like those above
and offered instead very general advice that few would quarrel
with.  Llewellyn Miller in <em>The Encyclopedia of Etiquette</em> (1967)
does inveigh against euphemisms like “in a family way,”
“expectorate,” and “lavatory” and such gobbledygook as, “finalize
an undertaking.”  But Charlotte Ford is more typical of
recent writers.  She states that “conversation is like a dance, in
that one partner leads and the other follows, the difference
being that the roles of leader and follower shift continuously.”</p>
<p>Of all the contemporary etiquette advisers, Elizabeth L.
Post seems to be the most prescriptive, yet compared to Miss
Leslie, she is mild indeed.  Concerning pronunciation, “cherce”
for <em>choice</em> is not acceptable, while “wawsh” for <em>wash</em> is.  “A
markedly local accent,” she warns, might suggest to some “a
mind limited to that particular locality and uninformed about
the broader issues.”  And while “coarse or profane words are
unnecessary,” slang, she notes, can be an asset to your
conversation.  A few terms are proscribed (“drapes” for <em>draperies</em>,
“reckon” for <em>think</em>, “folks” for <em>family</em>, and “party” for
<em>person</em>), but generally she advises, “Everything that is simple
and direct is better form than the cumbersome and
pretentious.”</p>
<p>Of course every generation would agree with this last
statement by Ms. Post, but each has its own definition of the
cumbersome and pretentious.  To be sure, linguistic codes
quickly outlive their usefulness, but reviewing them can throw
much light on the growth and direction of contemporary
language.</p>
