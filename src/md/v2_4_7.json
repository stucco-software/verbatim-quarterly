When this writer pointed out to Ogden Nash some years ago that his amusing rhyming couplet, “The Bronx?/No, thonx” was funny, but that it hurt what was left of the Bronx ego and its self-respect, the poet offered this apologia:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I wrote those lines, “The Bronx?  No, thonx”<br>\nI shudder to confess them.<br>\nBut now, a sadder, wiser man<br>\nI say, “The Bronx?  God bless them!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so should we all, every one.</p>",
