The reader gets the impression, though the author, educated at Oxford and London universities, was Professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of Hong Kong, that the book is either for beginning linguists or for interested parties from other disciplines. It suffers from one severe, reprehensible shortcoming: it lacks an index, something no book should be without.</p>\n<p>The book is short and simple, but not simplistic (a word used by some these days to avoid <em>over-simplified</em>); it is divided into fourteen brief chapters, the titles of which will give a good indication of what they are about (for a change). Each chapter concludes with “Notes and Suggested Further Reading,” and from the fairly sophisticated materials listed, one is not deluded into thinking that this is a lightweight work. The chapters are headed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is a word?</p>\n<p>The trouble with dictionaries</p>\n<p>The use of words: what happens when we talk</p>\n<p>How did words originate?</p>\n<p>How do words change their meaning?</p>\n<p>Word borrowing</p>\n<p>How are new words created?</p>\n<p>Words as structures</p>\n<p>How do we learn to use words?</p>\n<p>Choosing between words—words in context</p>\n<p>On the tip of one's tongue</p>\n<p>The written word</p>\n<p>Words and the poet</p>\n<p>Sticks and stones: words as reality</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is an “Afterword” that is even friendlier than the text. Space does not permit a more thorough investigation of the content, save to offer the advice that time spent with this book will prove informative and rewarding.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/stx_Verbatim_The_Language_Quarterly_v22n4_Spring_1996\">Internet Archive copy of this issue</a></p>",
