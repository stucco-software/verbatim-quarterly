It was generally well-researched, but there was one important inaccuracy. “Luck Be A Lady Tonight” was sung at Nathan Detroit's floating crap game, but by Sky Masterson, not Nathan Detroit. This led to irony in the movie version, because Nathan, who was present but did not sing it, was played by Frank Sinatra, while Sky, who did sing it, was played by Marlon Brando. Sinatra took sarcastic delight in pointing this out when introducing the song at subsequent concerts, referring to Brando as one of America's greatest baritones.</p>\n<p><em>Best regards, Steven Finz, <a href=\"mailto:finz@mail.mcn.org\">finz@mail.mcn.org</a></em></p>",
