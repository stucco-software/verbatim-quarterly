And I admit that,\nwhile not usually a porcine male chauvinist in other respects,\nI do find it linguistically jarring.

But that, I suppose, is\nan old-fashioned argument, and not one that would convince\nmany modern users.</p>\n<p>What interests me especially in this feminization of <em>guy</em>\nis the illogical limitation of its semantic field.  It seems to occur,\nin fact, only among acquaintances and then primarily in the\nvocative.  The same speakers who blithely use it in referring to\none another—“you guys” (and, less often, “us guys,” “those\nguys”)—wouldn't dream of using it to describe a person or\npersons outside the group and unknown to its members.  One\nwould never—at least, not yet—hear them say, for example,\nreferring to a bevy of female strangers: “We just saw a bunch\nof guys down at the carwash.”  (Except, I imagine, among\nmilitant lesbians.)  In other words, the noun is, at present, still\nsemantically restricted.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, however, it will not always remain so.  Perhaps\nwhat we are witnessing is a semantic shift in the making—\ncatching it in the act, as it were—always an exciting experience\nfor language buffs, whatever their social persuasion.\nPerhaps, indeed, <em>guy</em> is eventually to become as completely\nasexual as the now ever-present <em>person</em>.  Only time will tell, but\nI am one guy who will be watching.  In the meantime, male\nchauvinists offended by the usage always have the option to\nreact, derisively, by beginning to address one another as “you\ndolls.”  But that is one semantic shift I don't think we have to\nworry about.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
