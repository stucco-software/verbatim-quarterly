Morrow</p>\n<p>Swarthmore, PA             November 13, 1973</p>\n<p>Dear Mrs. Morrow:</p>\n<p>We are aware that your dislike for the interrogative\n“Who are we pleasing?”  is sometimes shared by others.\nSome people insist that this sentence should read,\n“Whom are we pleasing?”  But the use of the pronoun\nin an interrogative sentence, as here, needs to be\ndistinguished from the pronoun in “For whom the bell\ntolls” or “to whom it may concern.”</p>\n<p>When “who” is used as an interrogative pronoun, it\nis unnatural English to use its objective form, even\nwhen it is the object of a verb or preposition.  Noah\nWebster said that “Whom did you speak to?”  is “hardly\nEnglish at all” but...“is a corruption, and all the\ngrammars that can be found will not extend the use of\nthe phrase beyond the walls of a college.”</p>\n<p>When the word stands before a verb, as in “Who am\nI trying to please?”  the nominative form is preferred.\nThe form “whom” is required when the word follows a\npreposition (“To whom am I to send the letter?”).</p>\n<p>The invariable form “who” in interrogative\nconstructions was found in older and early in modern\nliterary English.  Shakespeare used it.  Speaking of this,\nthe noted grammarian Curme says, “The use of the\nnominative <em>who</em> as object is never ambiguous since...\n'who did they meet?'  indicates that <em>who</em>...modifies\nthe verb and cannot be the subject?”</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,</p>\n<p>The Editors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Mrs. Morrow:            May 29, 1975</p>\n<p>Thank you for calling to our attention the misuse of\n“who-whom” in the Monitor.  Unfortunately, this seems\nto be a fairly common error in today's world.  We do\nnot condone it in any way and try to be alert against it.\nBut we do not always succeed.</p>\n<p>We try to uphold the highest standards of proper\ngrammatical usage in the Monitor.  Alert readers are of\ngreat help in motivating us to maintain our high\nstandards and we appreciate your concern.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Dewey F Ray</p>\n<p>Chief of Copy Desk</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reference to George O. Curme draws one to his\ntwo books, <em>Parts of Speech and Accidence</em>, Heath, 1935, and\n<em>Syntax</em>, Heath, 1931: the latter contains the quotation cited\nby “The Editors” of <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em>.  It is on\npage 101 in a section that concludes with the comment, “In\ngeneral, however, the use of <em>who</em> for <em>whom</em> is receding in\nall functions in the literary language.”  Such usage is also\ncalled “careless language” by Curme.</p>\n<p>A further comment appears in <em>Parts of Speech</em>: 'I don't\nknow <em>who</em> (instead of <em>whom</em>) he plays with.'</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The relative pronoun always has the case form\nrequired by the construction of the clause in which it\nstands....  In ['I will go with <em>whoever</em> I like,' <em>who</em> is\nthe object of the preposition <em>with</em>.  We should\nwithstand the strong drift here toward the modern\nforms and use the more expressive older ones.</p>\n<p>[pp. 166-7]</p>\n<p>As we have in general abandoned the use of the old\ninflectional endings in favor of modern means of\nexpression, there is also here in colloquial speech a\nstrong tendency to employ modern forms—...: '<em>Who</em>\n(instead of <em>whom</em>) did you meet?'  '<em>Who</em> did you give it\nto?'  ...In choice language the tendency is to\nwithstand the very strong drift here toward the modern\nforms and use the more expressive older ones.  [p. 171]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no mistaking how Curme expressed himself,\nand the quotation in The Editors' letter is an explanation of\nwhy <em>who</em> replaces <em>whom</em> in certain constructions: it certainly\ncannot be construed as having received the grammarian's\napproval.</p>\n<p>[<em>Incidentally</em>, VERBATIM <em>is planning to publish a\nreprint of Curme's two books, one of the best and most\ncomplete reference grammars of contemporary English, rife\nwith examples from literature.  It would help greatly if\nreaders could provide us with some indication of their\npossible interest in having such works in their libraries.  Both\nbooks have been out of print since 1963</em>.—Editor]</p>",
