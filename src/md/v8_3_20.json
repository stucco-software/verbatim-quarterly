Thus <em>Smiths</em> are always “Sudger”, <em>Blacks</em>\ncan be “Darkie” or “Nigger” without any racial slurs\nintended—or taken.  <em>Browns</em> are either “Bomber,” “Topper,” or\n“Nigger”; a few are given the soubriquet “Chocko” ('chocolate').\n<em>Greys</em> and <em>Grays</em> are named “Dolly” from the wartime\nsong of that name, circa 1900.  <em>Greens,</em> for some reason I was\nnever able to uncover, begat “Dodger.”  Was Fagin's artful one\na green one or surnamed Green?  <em>Whites</em> could be “Chalky,”\n“Blanco,” “Snowie,” “Snowball,” or “Flarry” ('floury').  I heard\n(and worked with) the odd “Inky” <em>Pink.</em></p>\n<p><em>Millers</em> were “Dusty” as a general rule, as were some\n<em>Lanes</em> and <em>Rhodes</em>, though more <em>Lanes</em> were “Sandy” and the\nodd <em>Rhode</em> a “Stoney” one.  <em>Balls</em> were “Knacker” (a slang\nword for 'ballocks' or 'testicle') or “Ghoolie” (an East Indian\nword for 'ball') Some <em>Wood/Woods</em> were “Timber,” others\nwere “Lackry,” a word, again, from India—not to be confused\nwith <em>louri</em> or <em>lowry</em>—a word meaning 'lingam, penis.'  We had a\nHarry <em>Lowry</em> whose name suggested “hairy louri” and a <em>Larry</em>\n(redubbed “Louri”) O'Dowd, so named for his amatory\nexploits.</p>\n<p><em>Clark, Clarke,</em> and <em>Clerk</em> were always and forever “Nobby”\nor “Nobbo,” more often the former.  <em>Martins</em> in the Navy were\n“Pincher” and all <em>Westons</em> were known as “Aggie,” however\nmanly they were.  The <em>Martins</em> were named for an admiral, and\nthe <em>Westons</em> for Dame Agnes Weston, a well-known philanthropist\nand “hero” of the British Navy.  <em>Murphys</em> are “Spud,” as\n<em>Mulligans</em> and <em>Milligans</em> are “Spike” to all and sundry.  <em>Warners</em>\nare often as not “Plum,” for Sir Pelham W—whose first name is\npronounced as “P'lam”; Welsh <em>Davises</em> and <em>Davieses</em> are\n“Dai,” though <em>Lloyds, Thomases, Williamses, Morganses,</em> and\n<em>Evanses</em> seem to be “Taffy” or “Taff” rather than “Dai” ('dye'),\nboth Welsh forms for <em>David</em> (Dewi).  Most “Jocks” and “Scotties”\nwere and are last-named <em>Mac</em> something or other, as\n“Paddy” seems to be a generic for all the Irish <em>O'</em> names,\nregardless of proper baptismals.</p>\n<p>“Lank” is a nickname for a Lancastrian, but “Lanky” is\nsomeone 'tall, long legged, spindly'; a “Yorkie” comes from\nYorkshire; a “Geordie” is a Tynesider.  “Brum” or “Brummie” is\nfrom Brummagem—modern spelling is Birmingham—in Warwickshire,\nwhich we foreigners always managed to mispronounce\nas “Warwick” rather than the proper “warrik-shire.”</p>\n<p>“Shino” is a generic for bald heads or “skinheads,” as we\nnow call them; more recently I met and worked with a\n“Chrome-Dome <em>Brome</em>” whose moniker was very aptly fitting.\nAmong Army Signalmen, “Helio-head” was not uncommon for\na “baldy,” whether he was also a Smith, Jones, Robinson, or\nBrown.  “Wingy” is the one-armed gent, as “Gimpy” is one-legged\nor lame—but both outside the Services.</p>\n<p>My own nicknames overseas were many and varied,\nincluding such oddities as “Copperknob,” “Bloodnut,” “Rustynut,”\n“Flame'ead,” “Fire'ead,” “Ginge,” “Ginger,” “Fuchsi,”\n“Roti,” “Krasny,” and “Rubio.”  One co-worker dubbed me\n“Pincus,” though neither he nor I was a Jew.  My height (or\nlack of it) got me tagged “Kleiner,” “Malenky,” “Chota,” “P'tit\nJean,” “Titch” ('frequent'), “Kish,” “Dinky,” “Chico,” and the\nlike.  The first name <em>Jay</em> was a stumbling block for many and\nimpossible to equate with any name generally in use.  So it was\nchanged quite often to “Jason,” “Jake,” “John,” “Joe,” or their\nlinguistic equivalents—“Yan,” “Yanni,” “Yanke,” “Yanko,”\n“Pepi,” “Pepino,” “Yosli,” “Yischko,” or, in Wales, “Yanto,”\n“Yanto-bach,” or “Shunni-bach” ('John-boy').  Scots and Irish\ntended to opt for “Jaimie,” “Jemmy,” “Jummie,” or “Jimbo,”\nthough some gave me the fuller “Seamus,” (<em>Shay</em> and <em>Jay</em> being\npet forms of Seamus).</p>\n<p><em>Ames</em> was butchered into “Ah-mess,” “Ah-miss,”\n“Ahmos,” “Aymos,” “Aymess,” and the like, seldom “Aymz”;\nthe closest was the English pet form “Aimsie”—on a par with\n“Hobbsie” for <em>Hobbs</em>, “Webbsie” for <em>Webb</em>, and “Smittie” for\n<em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p>For some reason I've never fully understood, long names\nare reduced to a minimum; short names are lengthened in the\npet form or nicknaming process.  <em>Jay</em> also gave rise to “Jay-jay,”\n“Blue-jay,” and plain “Blue.”  Torontonian mothers today call\ntheir boys “Jay” when they're actually baptised <em>Jason, James,</em>\nand even <em>Jonathan,</em> I've discovered.</p>\n<p>Oddest, to my mind, was the “Stuka” nickname my POW\ndogtags (#88) earned me in German hospital during WW II.\nOne nickname I loathed (though it is no longer applicable) was\n“Beachball,” at a time when I was too short for my weight.  It\nmay well have helped get me back to normal.</p>",
