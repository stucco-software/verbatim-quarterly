Doolittle, Jr., Towson, Maryland</p>\n<p><em>Mr. Burchfield replies:</em></p>\n<p><em>impregnable</em></p>\n<p>The usual adjective in the <em>OED</em>, 1. Of a fortress or\nstronghold: that cannot be taken by arms (illustrated by\nquotations from 1430 to 1885); 2. <em>fig</em>.  That cannot be\novercome or vanquished (1582-1862), 'we are impregnable\nin our furs,' 'A man politely impregnable to the intrusion\nof human curiosity,' is not being joined in the forthcoming\nsecond volume of <em>A Supplement to the OED</em> by\nthe etymologically unrelated <em>impregnable</em> 'able to be impregnated.'</p>\n<p>When we dealt with words in <em>impr</em>- we had no examples\nof this new use and the position remains unchanged.\nMy scientific colleagues looked at the 1970-73 KWIC indexes\nof the <em>Biological Abstracts</em>, the decennial and quinquennial\nindexes of the <em>Chemical Abstracts</em>, and various\ntextbooks on embryology, including avian embryology, and\nhave not found the word used in print.  It looks as if it\nis not commonly used though printed evidence of its currency\npresumably exists somewhere as the word is treated\nin <em>Webster's Third</em> and in most other American dictionaries.</p>\n<p>The feeling here is that if anyone ever needed such a\nword, <em>impregnatable</em> would be the obvious form--as Fowler\nsuggested in <em>Modern English Usage</em> in 1926.</p>\n<p>We must be behind the times since the only comments\non the word in our files are anecdotal.  One of our\nreaders (she is in her seventies) still laments the use of\n<em>impregnable</em> at all because of the presence of the unetymological\n-<em>g</em>-, and went so far as to suggest that the\nwriter of the following example was 'illiterate':</p>\n<p>And another wrote 'And how!'  at the bottom of the slip\ncontaining the following example:</p>\n<p><em>R.W.
