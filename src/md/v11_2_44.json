Beckley, (Economics Press, 1984), 128pp.</p>\n<p>“Power” is right.  “Economics” may be the misnomer of\nthe year for a publisher pricing a book of about 35,000 words\nat fifteen dollars: that is heavy going even for these days.</p>\n<p>But my first suspicions were aroused by the author's first\nwords (in the foreword, titled “Hello!”): “This is not a book for\nscholars.”  He seems to have got it wrong from the start, for if\nthere is any group of writers (aside from the illiterati who\nproduce much of the computer documentation these days) who\nare in dire need of instruction on the simplification of their\nwriting, it is scholars.  There are always exceptions, of course,\nbut, as a group, scholars, whose main function must be to\ninterpret some facet of the world's myriad phenomena into\nterms that others can understand, seem to be extraordinarily\nsuccessful at the exact opposite—obfuscation—and a few lessons\nin logic, in the straightforward clarification of ideas, and in\nbasic language skills in expository writing ought to be a\nprerequisite for all academic degrees, especially the advanced\ndegrees awarded to those who are likely to be the ones\nresponsible for explaining the universe to others.</p>\n<p>Beckley, who turns out to be the founder of the Economics\nPress, is not your man, I'm afraid.  On pages 20 and 21, for\nstarters, he presents two passages of writing, the first\n“from an editorial that appeared in a business magazine,” the\nsecond, his rewritten version “using somewhat simpler\nwordage”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This has been a time of grand visions for the economy—some optimistic,\nsome pessimistic.  We have heard proposals for 'reindustrialization.'  We\nhave been told about\nstructural shifts that are\ncarrying us along to a\nservice economy.  We have\nheard of the death of basic\nindustries—and of their\nrenaissance,\n“Whatever school of\nthought we embrace, we\ncan be misled about the\nessential truth of what is\ngoing on.  Sweeping visions\nof what is happening tend\nto make us think that\nmystical laws of economics\nwill shape the days\nahead—that we should wait\nto see what is in store for\nus.<br>\n“This has also been a\ntime of criticism of<br>\nAmerican management,\nwith much of the criticism\ncoming from within its\nown ranks.  Healthy self-\nanalysis can be\nconstructive.  But, if we\nwallow in self-blame, the\neffort can be destructive to\nindividual companies and\nto the nation.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This has been a time\nof grand predictions for\nbusiness—some good, some\nbad.  Some people propose\nrebuilding our basic\nindustries.  Others forecast\na shift in emphasis from\nmanufacturing products to\ndelivering services-\ncomputer and communications services\nfor example.  We hear that\nbasic industries are dying—\nthen others report they're\nreviving.\n“Whatever school of\nthought we embrace, we\ncan easily be misled.\nSweeping predictions of\nwhat will happen tend to\nmake us think that\nmystical laws of economics\nare shaping the days\nahead.  All we need do is\nwait and watch it take\nplace.\n“American management\nhas been criticized, with\nmuch of the criticism\ncoming from its own\nranks.  That's not bad—it's\ngood.  But enough is\nenough.  If we wallow in\nself-criticism, it can be bad\nfor individual companies\nand the country as well.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The curious thing about the rewritten version is that\nalthough it is slightly different from the original, it isn't simpler,\nand Beckley has done nothing that I can see to improve it.  In\nfact, he has changed the tenses of the verbs to detract from the\nimmediacy of the original message (“what will happen” for\n“what is happening”), has changed some words for the worse\n(substituting “predictions” for “visions”), and has distorted the\nsense of the original writer's words (changing “we should wait\nto see what is in store for us” to “we need to wait and watch it\ntake place”).  The reader can make his own comparisons.</p>\n<p>But the book is a waste of time for other reasons.  It would\ntake a lot of persuading to convince me that people can learn\nto write simply and clearly without being subjected to a\ntraining program of some concentration over a period of (at\nleast) several months; they should be required to write regularly\nthousands of words a week which would be edited by\nsomeone who knows not only what he is doing but how to\nteach it to others.  There is no shortcut to learning how to write\nclearly (let alone well, much less artistically); it cannot be\nlearned from a book of any kind, and anyone who suggests that\nan aspiring writer can take a pill one day and wake up the\nfollowing morning knowing how to write well is perpetrating a\nfraud.  Another requirement of learning how to write is learning\nhow to read, how to read critically, and how to understand.\nThere may be some who are capable of writing well with little\ntraining, but they are geniuses, and we know how few of them\nthere are.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
