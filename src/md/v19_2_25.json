Tius</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Portland, Maine</span></em></p>\n<p>The names tribes gave themselves are not always known, sometimes because both tribe and language are extinct, attested to only by the name assigned to them by others. Some names (<em>Beaver, Blackfoot, Crow, Dog-Rib, Hare, Stone</em>) are English translations of Indian ones. Others have entered English through French (<em>Bois Brûlé, Coeur d'Alêne, Gros Ventre, Huron, Loucheux, Nez Percé, Pend d'Oreille</em>) and Spanish <em>(Guapo, Laguna, Manso, Orejón, Seminole, Tonto)</em>. Still others were given by neighboring tribes and, sometimes, even when the literal sense is known the connotations are unclear: for example, the Dakota name for the <em>Iowa (Ayuhwa)</em> 'Sleepy Ones'; the Blackfoot name for the <em>Kainah</em>, a division of the Blackfoot, <em>(Ah-kai-nah)</em> 'Many Chiefs.' Can we be sure no insult, no irony was intended?</p>\n<p>Some names seem to have been caught in English by a stranger's question: “Who are you?” “I am a man, a human being,” or, “We are people, the people who live here.” Hence, perhaps, come the names by which are known the <em>Déné, Etchemin</em> (archaic name of the <em>Passamaquoddy</em>), <em>Illinois, Inuit, Klamath, Kutchin, Maidu, Miwok, Patwin, Pomo, Tu</em>-<em>nica, Wintun, Yahi, Yana, Yokuts,</em> and <em>Yuit</em>: all mean 'person or people.' Other peoples gave more specific answers describing their being distinctly different from neighboring tribes. The <em>Clallam</em> said they were 'strong people.' The <em>Caddo</em> called themselves <em>kädohädächo</em> 'real chiefs'; the <em>Kiowa</em>, at least to themselves, were <em>kâ-i-gwŭ</em> 'the chief or principal people'; the <em>Iroquois</em> were 'superior men.' By contrast, the <em>Hopi</em> said, “We are <em>Hopituh</em> 'people of peace.' ” Was it after the same fashion that the <em>Cahita</em> answered? Or was their name, which means 'nothing' in Cahita, the answer to a quite different question?</p>\n<p>The question, “Who are <em>those</em> people?” must often have been asked—and answered. The Choctaw said, <em>Apalachi</em> 'helpers, allies'; the Blackfoot, <em>Atsina</em> 'Good people' the Nootka, also, inadvertently named the Wakash, saying, “Good = <em>waukash</em> 'good' just as the Sheepscot named the <em>Wannoak</em> by saying they were <em>nopesawenoak</em> 'warriors'; the Pomo said of their southwestern cousins, the Kashaya, that they were <em>kashaya</em> 'nimble, quick,' by way of praise, blame, or mere description.</p>\n<p>Often a tribe's fear or fearful experience is revealed in a name: [The name following &gt; is that yielded by the italicized word.]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ojibwa <em>ab-boin-ug</em> 'roasters' &gt; <em>Abanic</em></p>\n<p>Zuñi <em>apachú</em> 'enemy' &gt; <em>Apache</em></p>\n<p>Choctaw <em>hatak-apa</em> 'man-eaters, cannibal' &gt; <em>Atakapa</em></p>\n<p>Mohican <em>maquia</em> 'cannibal' &gt; <em>Mohawk</em></p>\n<p>Abnaki <em>mayquay</em> 'cannibal' &gt; <em>Mohawk</em></p>\n<p>Ojibwa <em>nadoweoisiw</em> 'little snake' &gt; <em>Sioux</em></p>\n<p>Pima <em>opata</em> 'hostile people' &gt; <em>Opata</em></p>\n<p>Narragansett <em>paquatanog</em> 'destroyer' &gt; <em>Pequot</em></p>\n<p>Blackfoot <em>sa arsi</em> 'not good' &gt; <em>Sarcee</em></p>\n<p>Blackfoot <em>shoshoni</em> 'snake' &gt; <em>Shoshoni</em></p>\n<p>Wintun <em>yuki</em> 'stranger, enemy' &gt; <em>Yuki</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Strangers were not only likely to be hostile, they also spoke strangely. The Malecite or Maliseet were <em>maliseet</em> 'broken talkers' to the Micmac and 'talkers of gibberish' <em>males</em> to the Abnaki. To the Dakota, the Cheyenne were <em>shaiyena</em> 'people of unintelligible speech'; to the Creek, the Cherokee were <em>tciloki</em> 'people of a different speech'; and the Tul'bush, to the Wailaki, were 'babblers, foreigners' <em>tul'bush.</em></p>\n<p>The Wabanaki (or Lenni Lenape) called the Mohicans <em>amahiganiak</em> 'wolves,' referring either to their predatory habits or (less probably) to their totemic animal, as the Dakota name for the <em>Absaroka</em> 'bird- or crow-people' seems to have done.</p>\n<p>Many names point to the appearance, customs, staple diet, occupation, possessions or “stamping ground” of a tribe, as in the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Achomawi <em>achomawi</em> 'river people' &gt; <em>Achomawi</em></p>\n<p>Huron <em>adirondack</em> 'men of the trees' &gt; <em>Adirondack</em></p>\n<p>Mohawk <em>adirondack</em> (<em>hatiróntak</em>) 'bark-eaters' ('they eat trees') &gt; <em>Adirondack</em></p>\n<p>Acoma <em>akomé</em> 'people of the white rock' &gt; <em>Acoma</em></p>\n<p>Skidi Pawnee <em>arikara</em> 'horns' (from their hairstyle); <em>Arikara</em></p>\n<p>Ojibwa <em>atâwe</em> 'to trade' &gt; <em>Ottawa</em></p>\n<p>Cree <em>atâweu</em> 'trader' &gt; <em>Ottawa</em></p>\n<p>Choctaw <em>bashokla, paskokla</em> 'bread people' &gt; <em>Pascagoula; báyuk-ókla</em> 'bayou people' &gt; <em>Bayogoula</em></p>\n<p>Caddo <em>bidai</em> 'brushwood people' &gt; <em>Bidai</em></p>\n<p>Chehalis <em>chehalis</em> 'sand' &gt; <em>Chehalis</em></p>\n<p>Chetco <em>cheti</em> 'close to the mouth of the stream' &gt; <em>Chetco</em></p>\n<p>Apache <em>chiricahue</em> 'great mountain' &gt; <em>Chiricahua</em></p>\n<p>Choctaw <em>chutimasha</em> 'they have cooking pots' &gt; <em>Chitimasha</em></p>\n<p>Walapai <em>havasúpai</em> 'people of the blue water' &gt; <em>Havasupai</em></p>\n<p>Kalispel <em>kalispel</em> 'camas' &gt; <em>Kalispel</em></p>\n<p>Karok <em>káruk</em> 'upstream' &gt; <em>Karok</em></p>\n<p>Choctaw <em>katápa</em> 'separated' &gt; <em>Catawba</em></p>\n<p>Pomo <em>kato</em> 'lake' &gt; <em>Kato</em></p>\n<p>Coos <em>kūūs</em> 'south' &gt; <em>Coos</em></p>\n<p>Cree <em>mashkek</em>, Fox <em>maskyägi</em> 'grassy bog, muskeg' &gt; <em>Muskogee</em></p>\n<p>Delaware <em>minassiniu</em> 'people of the stony country' &gt; <em>Minsi</em></p>\n<p>Sioux <em>miniconjou</em> 'they who plant by the water' &gt; <em>Miniconjou</em></p>\n<p>Mandan <em>minitari</em> 'they crossed the water' &gt; <em>Minnetaree</em> (=Hidatsa)</p>\n<p>Hopi <em>móchi</em> 'awl people' &gt; <em>Móchi</em></p>\n<p>Nanticook <em>naitaquok</em> 'tidewater people' &gt; <em>Nanticook</em></p>\n<p>Hopi <em>ngölapki</em> 'the crook of longevity' &gt; <em>Walpi</em></p>\n<p>Wintu or Nomlaki <em>nomlaki</em> 'west speech' &gt; <em>Nomlaki</em></p>\n<p>Choctaw <em>panshiokla</em> 'hair-people' &gt; <em>Pensacola</em></p>\n<p>Cree <em>pegonow</em> 'muddy-water people' &gt; Piegan</p>\n<p>Nez Percé <em>peluse</em> 'something sticking up out of the water' &gt; <em>Palouse, Appaloosa</em></p>\n<p>Shawnee <em>shaawanawa, shawan</em> 'south' &gt; <em>Shawnee</em></p>\n<p>Shoshoni <em>shoshoko</em> 'walker' &gt; <em>Shoshoko</em></p>\n<p>Sioux <em>sihasapa</em> 'black foot' &gt; <em>Sihasapa</em> &gt; <em>Siksika</em></p>\n<p>Keresan <em>sĩni</em> 'middle' &gt; <em>Zuni</em></p>\n<p>Kalapooia <em>tfalati</em> 'river people' &gt; <em>Atfalati</em></p>\n<p>Shoshoni <em>tübatulabal</em> 'pine-nut eaters' &gt; <em>Tübatulabal</em></p>\n<p>Quapaw <em>ugákhpa</em> 'down-stream people' &gt; <em>Quapaw</em> or <em>Kwapa</em> ( &gt; <em>Acánsa</em> &gt; Arkansas)</p>\n<p>Delaware <em>umalachtigo</em> 'tidewater people' &gt; <em>Unalachtigo, W'nalachtigo</em></p>\n<p>Ojibwa <em>ŭsini-ŭpwäwa</em> 'one who cooks by use of stones' &gt; <em>Assiniboin</em></p>\n<p>Wintan <em>wailaka</em> 'northern language' &gt; <em>Wailaki</em></p>\n<p>Wanapum <em>wanapum</em> 'river-people' &gt; <em>Wanapum</em></p>\n<p>Wasco <em>wasq'o</em> 'cup, small bowl' &gt; <em>Wasco</em></p>\n<p>Osage <em>wazha'zhe</em> 'water' (a clan name) &gt; <em>Osage</em></p>\n<p>Yuman <em>xawálapáiya</em> 'pine-tree people' &gt; <em>Walapai</em></p>\n<p>Karok <em>yúruk</em> 'a considerable distance downstream' &gt; <em>Yurok</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are names with more than one possible etymology. The Arapaho called themselves 'trader <em>(s) arapaho;</em> the Crow called them <em>aa-raxpé-ahu</em> 'having much skin' (i.e., 'tattooed'), and it is the Crow word that has found its way into the etymological information in <em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</em>. The Micmac called themselves <em>megumawaach</em> 'perfect men' and <em>migmac</em> 'allies'; the Maliseet called them <em>micmac</em> 'porcupine people' and <em>mi k'am</em> in Maliseet meant both “Micmac” and 'wood spirit.' In various Algonquian languages, the Ojibwa were 'the greatest' (<em>ochibe, ochippe, ochipwe, ojibwa, otchipwe)</em> but <em>ojib-ubway</em> 'mocassins with a puckered seam' (a style characteristic of Ojibwa footwear), literally, 'to roast till puckered up' is the origin cited in <em>Webster's.</em></p>\n<p>No etymology is provided for <em>Papago</em> and <em>Pima;</em> both might be Hopi for, respectively, 'mark on the forehead' and 'reed grass,' plausible origins since all three peoples have inhabited parts of what is now known as Arizona.</p>\n<p>A few names are neither English translations nor mispronounciations and approximations of Indian words. <em>Flat-Head</em>, for example, refers to several tribes (Catawba, Chinook, Choctaw, Waxshaw, et al.) that once practised head-flattening; and the <em>Yellowknife</em>, an Algonquian people living east of Great Slave Lake, Canada, were so named from their use of copper implements: pedestrian names, these, in which inventiveness played no part. But, for that matter, it seems that inventiveness never has played a part in producing the names of tribes. Their multiplicity merely reflects the rich diversity of those who have inhabited North America since before the arrival of the “white man” —whenever that might have been.</p>",
