An alternate solution is <em>reason</em>, the only word containing an 'a' among the three options. 5,4,5,4 word lengths also yields her answer.</p>\n<p>#4 <em>Pound, bellow, page,</em> + <em>warden</em> : (Famous last names). Same solution, but in this case, noticing that the vowels are in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>#5 <em>Novelties, marshmallow, decorations, </em>+ <em>apricots</em>. (Month abbreviations at start of words). <em>Pasta</em> is an alternate answer, insofar as those four can be broken up into two consecutive words.</p>\n<p>#8 <em>demon, bosun, brewed,</em> + <em>virtues</em>. (Words end in day abbreviations). Another solution is <em>straits.</em> Those four comprise two words, one forwards, one backwards.</p>\n<p>#14 <em>Waco, rind, gala,</em> + <em>mice</em>. (Remove inner letters to leave “word game”). Try a simpler solution—<em>star.</em> None of those four contain an 'e'.</p>\n<p>#15 <em>age, hole, date,</em> + <em>go</em>. (Add 'man' to beginning). Or, one can add a 'd' to the end.</p>\n<p>It's tough to make word puzzles that can't be cooked!</p>\n<p><em>[Carl Huber, York Pennsylvania]</em></p>",
