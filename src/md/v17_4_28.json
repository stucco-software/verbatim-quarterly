A word like <em>Goody!, Great!, piddling</em>,\nor <em>tart up</em> would fall into this category, though\nthe kind and quantity of terms included depend\nlargely on the prudishness of the person doing the\nlabeling.  <em>Vulgar</em>, which really means no more than\n'unrefined,' is rarely encountered in modern dictionaries\nas a label because people have taken to\ndesignating four-letter words as vulgar, illustrating\nthe semantic process known as <em>pejoration</em> 'depreciation,'\nthe opposite of <em>melioration</em>.  Today we should\nprobably consider labeling <em>Great!</em> as <em>Vulgar</em> a bit\nharsh.  Because dictionary users became accustomed\nto seeing words and senses of which they disapproved\n(in formal contexts) bearing the <em>Colloquial</em>\nlabel, the word <em>colloquial</em> began to undergo pejoration\nitself.  By the early 1960s, when the labels to be\nused in <em>The Random House Dictionary</em> were being\nreviewed and discussed, we decided to drop the <em>Colloquial</em>\nlabel used in <em>The American College Dictionary</em>\nin favor of <em>Informal</em>, a practice followed by most\nEnglish dictionary publishers from that time until\nnow.  <em>Colloquial</em> means nothing more than 'used in\ncolloquy, or conversation' and is thus no more than a\nhigh-flown term for <em>conversational</em>, which, as far as I\nknow, carries no stigma.  (<em>Slang</em> is far too complex a\nnotion and label to discuss here and will be treated\nat another time.)</p>\n<p>Why lexicographers have not used <em>Conversational</em>\nor its abbreviations, <em>Conv.</em> or <em>Convers</em>., I cannot\nsay: perhaps some have and I am not aware of it.\nMy own observation is that <em>Informal</em> might be undergoing\nits own round of pejoration — these things\nsometimes go in cycles — and, in a reference book I\nrecently completed, which will be published by Oxford\nUniversity Press in the autumn of 1991, I have\nchosen to return to <em>Colloq</em>.  As the book is in\nmachine-readable form, should the publisher decide,\nin a generation's time, to switch back to <em>Informal</em>,\nthe change can be readily accommodated by\nperforming a simple substitution program on a computer,\nand all the <em>Colloqs</em> will become <em>Infs</em> before\nyou know it.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
