Maybe I ought to\nchange the name....  What do you think of\n<em>Rhapsody in Mauve</em>?</p>\n<p>IRA:  For God's sake, George!</p>\n<p>GEO.: ...<em>in Cerise?</em></p>\n<p>IRA: George, we're not getting anywhere.  Neither\none of us has had any inspiration in months.\nThe last money we made was the $10 you got\nfor playing in that honkytonk over near\nBroadway.  We have to do <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>[<em>There is a knock at the door.  George rises to open it</em>.]</p>\n<p>GEO.: Yes?</p>\n<p>MESSENGER: You George and Ira?</p>\n<p>GEO.: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MESS.: Ya mudda sent me ova wid dis here book faw\nya.</p>\n<p>GEO.: My mother?!</p>\n<p>MESS.: Yeah.  Sign here.</p>\n<p>GEO.: (<em>Signing</em>.)  Ira, do you suppose Ma has given up\nsending jars of chicken soup? Maybe hunger has\ndriven us all mad.</p>\n<p>[<em>Messenger leaves.  George crosses to desk, unwrapping book</em>.]</p>\n<p>IRA: Let's see.</p>\n<p>[<em>They bend over the book</em>.]</p>\n<p>TOGETHER: (<em>Reading</em>.)  <em>Walker's Rhyming Dictionary</em>.</p>\n<p>IRA: (<em>Puzzled</em>.)  What are we supposed to do with\nthis?  Eat it?</p>\n<p>GEO.: Let's see.  (<em>Scanning through book</em>.)  Hey, Ira!\nHow about this: can you come up with a lyric\nrhyming <em>choreography</em> with <em>stereography</em> and\n<em>cardiography</em>?</p>\n<p>IRA: George, please!Be serious!</p>\n<p>GEO.: I am being serious!  Just think!  You could write\nundying lyrics, which I could set to music,\nusing this book.  How about “You sleek geek/You\nreek from fenugreek”?</p>\n<p>IRA: Beautiful, George.  It doesn't even scan.</p>\n<p>GEO.: That's okay.  Suppose you set Ogden Nash to\nmusic?  That wouldn't scan, either.  Take a look\nat this book, Ira, maybe you'll get an idea.</p>\n<p>IRA: (<em>Reading</em>.)  Hey, this is great, George.  Give me a\nfew minutes.</p>\n<p>[<em>George returns to piano and beats out his famous composition,\n“Boogie-woogie to Read By.”  Ira continues to read, then starts\nto write furiously.

Let's hear it, let's\nhear it.</p>\n<p>IRA: I see it as a romantic ballad, George.\n(<em>Wistfully</em>.)  It'll be another <em>Begin with Bay'gin</em>.</p>\n<p>GEO.: That's begeen', Ira; Bay'gin was the prime\nminister of Israel.  The title is <em>Begin the\nBeguine</em>.</p>\n<p>IRA: So what?  Just listen to this: (<em>Recites</em>.)</p>\n<p>When I see her samba\nI shout “Ai!  Caramba!”\nShe slips me a mamba\nWhile I eat my tsamba.\nViola da gamba—</p>\n<p>GEO.: (<em>Interrupting</em>.)  Wait a minute!  Just a minute!\nWhat's a tsamba?</p>\n<p>IRA: According to the Supplement to <em>Walker's,\ntsamba</em> is a Tibetan barley dish.</p>\n<p>GEO.: Isn't that pretty far-fetched?  What's the viola da\ngamba doing there?</p>\n<p>IRA: Poetic license, George.  Poetic license.  I'm just\nstringing you along....</p>\n<p>GEO.: What's romantic about mamba and tsamba?</p>\n<p>IRA: Romance is in the eye of the beholder.</p>\n<p>GEO.: I think you'd better try something else, Ira.</p>\n<p>IRA: (<em>Leafing through book.  Stops</em>.)  I've got it!</p>\n<p>GEO.: Let's have it.</p>\n<p>IRA:  How's this?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When push comes to shove,<br>\nAs heaven knows above<br>\nI really am in love<br>\nwith you.</p>\n<p>We stand in the breeze<br>\nYou almost start to sneeze<br>\nI get down on my knees—<br>\nAdieu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GEO.:  Please!  For heaven's sake!  Even if I could write\nmusic to that, who'd want to listen to it?!</p>\n<p>IRA:  Is this better?\nI'm filled with pusillanimity\nWhenever you're in the vicinity....</p>\n<p>GEO.: Give it up, Ira!</p>\n<p>IRA:  No!  I won't give up.  This book is an\ninspiration.  Maybe we can come up with a title\nthat'll help.</p>\n<p>GEO.: Like what?</p>\n<p>IRA: How about, “His Eye Is on the Marrow”?</p>\n<p>GEO.: No.</p>\n<p>IRA: “Alexander's Rag-content Bond”?</p>\n<p>GEO.: Ira!</p>\n<p>IRA: “Effaceable You”?</p>\n<p>GEO.: !</p>\n<p>IRA: “White and Gray, You Are the One”?</p>\n<p>[<em>George picks up a batch of sheet music and throws it at Ira as\nthe curtain falls.</em>]</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
