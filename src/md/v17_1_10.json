O. Box 16681, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 1989), xii + 321pp.</p>\n<p>I once told myself that I would not look any further\ninto a book or article that quoted Lewis Carroll's\ntired old Humpty Dumpty quotation about\nwords meaning what he wants them to mean.  Such a\npolicy is unfair, of course: one should not be prejudiced\nagainst a person's magnum opus just because\nhe has a tiresome taste in quotations.  People are forever\ndiscovering such quotations for the first time\nand should not be excoriated for it by a dyspeptic,\ncurmudgeonly reviewer.  Reviewers are supposed to\nhave—or pretend to have—open, inquiring minds,\nand a boring quotation maketh not a boring book—\nnecessarily.  Alas, I should learn to follow my instincts.</p>\n<p>I suppose that there is a category of reference\nbook called the <em>reverse dictionary</em>.  There is no denying\nthat such a work, which would enable a user to\nfind the word or phrase he is seeking by looking up a\nmeaning, would be quite useful.  I have a number of\nideas for preparing one in machine-readable form\nfor use in a computer, but I shall not reveal them\nhere.  The way printed versions of such books function\nis for the user to look up associated information.\nThe main problem with them is that they rely on the\ncompiler's ability to anticipate with some accuracy\nthe associative contextual framework of the user.\nWithin the relatively limited amount of information\na bound volume of 320 pages can provide, it would\nbe difficult to anticipate the user's mind set with sufficient\nallowance for elaboration.  The books of this\nkind that I have tried to use have frustrated me: I\nnever can find what I am looking for.</p>\n<p>But I am sufficiently open-minded to forget\nwhat I might be looking for—some bit of lexicographic\nesoterica, no doubt—and settle for something\nI consider to be much simpler and not readily\nderivable from an ordinary dictionary.  As we all\nknow, if we knew the word we were looking for (and\nknew how to spell it) we should not have to resort to\nreverse dictionaries.  Trying to be fair, I cooked up a\ntest or two.  The first (to which most of us know the\nanswer, I suppose, but that makes it no less legitimate)\nis, What is the nautical term for the left and\nright sides of a boat?  One cannot discover the answer\nby looking up <em>left</em> or <em>right</em> in an ordinary dictionary,\nof course.  Unfortunately, neither <em>left</em> nor\n<em>right</em> (nor <em>port</em> nor <em>starboard</em>) is in, and I should have\nto hang around yacht clubs to get the answer.  I had\nspotted some obscure terms (like <em>widdershins</em> under\n<em>counterclockwise</em>) when skimming through the\nbook, so I thought Dr. Welsh might have concentrated\non those.  He did to some extent, (though <em>deasil</em>\nwas not in, so I sought in vain under <em>shadow</em> for\n<em>antiscian</em>, which is about as obscure as one can get.\nThe other day I had a letter from someone who\nwanted to know the name for the accent over the <em>r</em>\nin <em>Dvořak</em>, which happens to be among the two or\nthree things I know.  As Welsh's book has a list under\nPRONUNCIATION, I looked there, to no avail.  (It is\ncalled a <em>haček</em> or <em>hachek</em> or <em>haček</em>, pronounced\nHOTchek.)</p>\n<p>I cannot find it in my heart to fault Dr. Welsh for\nhis failure: he probably tried out his ideas on friends\nwho might well have been able to find what they\nwere looking for.  I am convinced that there is a way\nto do this kind of thing, but a book is not it: the kind\nof associative information required to find even the\nsimplest thing is likely to vary considerably from\nuser to user, depending on orientation, education,\nage, and other factors; including a large variety of\nways to access the same information would be very\nuneconomical in book form, especially when high-speed\ncomputers with large memories are so readily\navailable.  The problem is less one of simple (!) lexicology\nas one of information theory and psychology.\nI might add artificial intelligence just to make it\nharder, but why make the issue more confused than\nit is already?  This book does not work for me.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
