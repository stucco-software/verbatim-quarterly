He was a good horse.<br>\n<em>Ha un cane assai bravo</em>.  He has a very good dog.<br>\n<em>Un bravo folegname</em>.  A skilled woodworker.<br>\n<em>Una brava cuoca</em>.  A good cook.<br>\n<em>Il tuo amico è una brava persona</em>.  Your friend is a\ndecent guy.<br>\n<em>Sii bravi mentre la mamma è fuori</em>.  Be good (children)\nwhile mommy is out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The noun, which is pejorative and always masculine,\nis defined as 'cutthroat.'  The Italian synonym is\n<em>sgherro</em>.  I think we would all agree that that was not\nbeing shouted at La Scala.</p>\n<p>And finally we come to the interjection, <em>esclamazione</em>\nin Italian.  The synonyms given in the ItalianItalian\ndictionaries which I consulted are <em>Bene!</em> and\n<em>Bis!</em> These mean 'well (done)' and 'encore.'  It is clear\nthat these words refer not to the performer, but to the\nperformance.  The Italian-English dictionaries generally\ntranslate <em>Bravo!</em> as “Capital; Well done.”  One\ndictionary added “Hurrah, Hurray!”  Again, we see\nthat <em>Bravo!</em> refers to the performance.  Even if the\nword were not invariable, which it is, why would it\nagree with the <em>performer</em> in gender and number?</p>\n<p>That the word is indeed invariable is shown by\nthe following example: <em>accogliere dei “bravo!” che\nnon finivano più</em>, “to receive bravos that were neverending.”\n(From <em>A Short Italian Dictionary</em>, Hoare,\nCambridge University Press, American Edition, 1967.)\nSo that even as its own plural (as proved by <em>dei</em>),\n<em>Bravo!</em> does not change its form.</p>\n<p>Finally, to revert briefly to the adjective; who\nwould apply a wet-rag adjective like <em>bravo</em>, used\nmainly for animals, children, and workingmen, to a\ndiva like Montserrat Caballé?  It would be the ultimate\nexample of damning with faint praise!</p>\n<p><em>[Arthur J. Morgan, New York City]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
