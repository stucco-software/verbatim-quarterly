It simply means that a player holds the racquet parallel to the ground and grips it from that position. It was considered inelegant and freakish when Bill Johnston, a contemporary of Bill Tilden's from California, used it in eastern tournaments, and it remained so until Bjorn Borg revived it in the 1970s. In spite of Borg's winning ways, tennis purists still regard the <em>western grip</em> as having the same relationship to good tennis as leprosy has to good health. Other tennis grips are the <em>Eastern</em> and the <em>Continental</em>. Oddly, none of these words has anything to do with the referent— the manner in which one grips a tennis racquet.</p>\n<p>[Burling Lowrey, Washington, D.C.]</p>\n<h2></h2>",
