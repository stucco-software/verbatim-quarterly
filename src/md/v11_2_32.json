I have received such a gift once or twice in my life.  I can\nalso attest to the phenomenon of a <em>rime donné</em>—a single word\nthat is not only the perfect rhyme to finish a couplet, but is in\nfact the only word in the entire language which could serve\nthis purpose.  This does not refer to “made up” rhymes which\nsome poets have resorted to when the gift of the Muses failed\nto arrive.  Thus, Poe in <em>Ulalume</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The skies they were ashen and sober;<br>\nThe leaves they were crisped and sere...<br>\nIt was night in the lonesome October<br>\nOf my most immemorial year;<br>\nIt was hard by the dim lake of Auber...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Poe, it appears, found a <em>rime donné</em> in “sober” to rhyme with\n“October”; but he needed one more rhyme-word to round out\nthe image, and since it did not come wafting in over his study\ndoor he created a fictitious “dim lake of Auber.”  Not the real\nthing, but it worked.  Robert Browning also did not wait for the\ngift but concocted his own outrageous rhymes: <em>Congo/let's on\ngo; capsule/perhaps you'll</em>; and dozens more.  These are not, I\nthink, what Valéry had in mind.</p>\n<p>To cite some legitimate examples: a 19th-century poet\nwhose name I cannot recall evoked a peaceful evening mood\nwith these beginning lines:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sun sinks 'neath the ridge<br>\nAnd the usual evening midge<br>\nIs settled on the bridge<br>\nOf my nose...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that the three rhyming words are virtually the only\n“-idge” trio that one could possibly adduce.  A triple gift!</p>\n<p>Again, in the light-verse category, I might give an example\nof my own.  I was writing a few clerihews—those four-liners\nthat start with a famous name and go on to say something\ninsightful about the person named—just at the time when\nda Vinci's <em>Mona Lisa</em> was being exhibited at the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art in New York (on loan from the Louvre).  It was\nwell guarded by security agents and was stared at by thousands\nof viewers daily.  I started my clerihew</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mona Lisa—</p>\n<p>then came to a dead stop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I could think of no exact rhyme.  “Teaser,” “pleaser,” etc., are\nnot true rhymes.  I was about to give up when the <em>rime donné</em>\nflashed on my mind as if out of a conjuror's box.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mona Lisa,\nHere on a special visa—</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rest followed easily:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Guarded by FBI and Sûreté agents all the while,\nStill managed a little smile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another instance: while “shrinking” seventy classics of\nliterature and transmuting them into verse for a paperback\ncalled <em>Shrinklits</em>, I tackled <em>Walden</em> by Thoreau.  The exercise\ncalled for drastic verbal economy while preserving the sense of\nthe original.  Here is the beginning of the “shrinklit”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beyond mere goods<br>\nThe pond, the woods;<br>\nLive there as I<br>\nAnd simplify...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(it runs on for several more lines).\nKnowing Thoreau's aversion to commercialism and his reasons\nfor going to the Walden area, I was obliged at the outset to find\na rhyme for “woods.”  As you observe, the gift-word arrived in\nthe first line.</p>\n<p>This phenomenon makes no class distinctions.  It may be\nfound in the lowliest ditty, as one song-writer discovered while\ncomposing lyrics for “The Bearded Lady,” a barber-shop\nmelody some readers may recall.  It begins</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I love the bearded lady 'cause her whiskers tickle so,\nHer whiskers make me prickle from my head down to\nmy toe,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now the lyricist wanted to employ the word “passionate” but\nthat appeared impossible to rhyme, except for the inspiration\nof the <em>donné</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The kiss with the mustache in it!<br>\nNo wonder I'm so passionate ... etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ogden Nash must have been on excellent terms with the\nMuse in this particular.  A striking example is his brief but\npungent observation, entitled (I quote from memory) “Lines to\na Baby's Bottom”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A little talcum<br>\nIs always walcum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It may be questioned whether Valéry would have admitted\nthe last two specimens as qualifiers.  I leave the judgment up to\nthe reader.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
