Tankard</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Jr.</span></em></p>\n<p>We have noticed a growing use of the word <em>literally</em> in\nthe past year.  Recently we heard a well-educated friend use\nthe word three times in the course of an evening's conversation.\n<em>Literally</em> is also showing up more and more frequently\nin the mass media, unfortunately with a growing lack of\nprecision.  Theodore M. Bernstein writes in <em>The Careful\nWriter: A Modern Guide to English Usage</em> that “literally\nmeans true to the exact meaning of the words.”  Many people\nmisuse the word to mean <em>figuratively</em> or <em>virtually</em>.  Others\njust use it as an unnecessary superlative.</p>\n<p>We have found examples in the following three categories\nof usage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>INACCURATE (AND OFTEN ABSURD):</p>\n<p>An official at the U.S. Government Printing Office\nwrote, “...we were literally swamped with your\norders.”</p>\n<p>A brochure advertising calendars stated, “...we know\nthat you are literally flooded with calendars from which\nto choose...”</p>\n<p>A TV commercial for a teriyaki sauce spoke of “a flavor\nthat literally sparkles.”</p>\n<p>In the James Bond film <em>The Man with the Golden Gun</em>,\none of the characters says the highest bidder for solar\nenergy “will literally have the sun in his pocket.”</p>\n<p>A noted Black author said in a speech, “...for\ngenerations the talents of Black people were literally\npoured down the drain.”</p>\n<p>A psychologist reviewing for a journal wrote that a\nbook was “literally mind expanding.”</p>\n<p>Another psychologist reviewing a book for the same\njournal wrote that it presented a consensus that “literally\nscares the hell out of me.”</p>\n<p>An editor for a different journal wrote the following\nponderous sentence: “During the past few years,\nscientific interest in and attention to the nonverbal\ncomponents of human behavior and the relationship of\nhuman beings to their physical environment have\nliterally mushroomed.”</p>\n<p><em>The New York Times Book Review</em> contained this statement:\n“Following literally in the projected footsteps of\nHarper &amp; Row,...we headed out to California to see\nif the grass was any greener.”</p>\n<p>A minister told a city council his telephone “has\nliterally rung off the hook” since a newspaper\npublished a series about massage parlors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ACCURATE BUT UNNECESSARY:</p>\n<p>A psychologist reviewing for a journal wrote: “This is a\nmost readable book.  It is literally exciting.”</p>\n<p>A high-brow magazine wrote in a letter seeking\nsubscribers: “After screening literally hundreds of\nmailing lists, we came up with a relative handful of\nnames like yours...”</p>\n<p>A labor leader said during a TV interview: “We've just\nliterally got to reduce the work load.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CORRECT:</p>\n<p>A news magazine wrote about Gary Gilmore: “The\nsentence of death was carried out, eighteen minutes\nlate, only after an extraordinary round of desperation\nappeals — the last of which was turned down by the\nU.S. Supreme Court as the prisoner literally sat facing\nexecution.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes a careful writer will use a word like <em>actually</em>\nwhere a weaker writer would use <em>literally</em>.  The following is\nfrom a short story by Ann Beattie in <em>The New Yorker</em>: “It\nhurt her badly, made her actually <em>dizzy</em> with surprise and\nshame, and since then, no matter who the guests are, she\nnever feels quite at ease on the weekends.”</p>\n<p>The fact that we found only one instance in the “correct”\ncategory makes us conclude that it is difficult to use\n<em>literally</em> accurately.  We would argue that the word should\nbe saved for those rare cases when something that is usually\nmetaphorical or figurative is actually true.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
