In the second place, one would have expected a bit\nmore consistency on the part of the author in his handling of\ngenders.  For some reason, he regularly used the feminine\nform in translating <em>left</em> and the masculine form in translating\n<em>right</em>.  One hesitates to level the charge of linguistic male\nchauvinism at Mr. Schulman but has little choice after absorbing\nhis ideas about the inferiority of the <em>left</em>.  When referring\nto <em>right</em> or <em>left</em> as a direction, the feminine form is correct in\nFrench, Spanish and Portuguese, since the word 'hand' is inferred,\nwhich is feminine in all three languages (<em>main, mano</em>,\nand <em>mão</em>, respectively).  It is not proper to use the masculine\nforms <em>droit, derecho</em>, or <em>direito</em> standing alone as meaning\n'right,' but only when they are modifying a masculine noun. [<em>Daniel N.
