For example, <em>briquet</em> is a funny word, but <em>charcoal</em> isn't, so <em>charcoal briquet</em> does not fall into this special category.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, <em>nougat</em> is funny, and word <em>fandango</em> is funny, but regrettably there is no such thing as a <em>nougat fandango.</em></p>\n<p>In fact, so far I've only been able to think of one other example:</p>\n<p><em>Toaster Pastry</em></p>\n<p>So, the brain-teaser: can you think of more such phrases?</p>\n<p>Also: I haven't been able to think of a good name for this category of phrases. I have only had two ideas so far: “moist towelettes” and “toaster pastries.” I bet some VERBATIM reader can do better.</p>\n<p><em>Brian Rice</em></p>\n<p>P.S.
