Heigh-ho!\nTurkish at means ‘horse.’ Galloping on to <em>mare</em>, we are\nbrought up short at Chinese (Peking) <em>ma\\?\\3</em> ‘horse’ before arriving\nat the mare of <em>nightmare</em> (akin to Croatian <em>mora</em>,\nOld High German and Old Norse <em>mara</em> ‘incubus,’ and reminiscent-at\nleast to us-of French <em>mère</em> and Greek\n<em>mègaera)</em>. Turkish <em>cadi</em> means ‘vampire, hag, witch’; Greek\n<em>tzadogria</em> means ‘hag, witch’; both sound like Hindi <em>jadoo</em>\nor <em>jadu</em> ‘magic.’ Then there is Turkish <em>harm</em>, used only of\nhorses, which means ‘jaded, vicious, worn-out’-a fairly\ngood description of French <em>haridelle</em>. English harridan has\nlost its French equine connotation but keeps the ‘strumpethag-jade’\nsense.

While hastening from <em>yaud</em>,\nwe stumbled upon Chinese (Peking) <em>yu\\?\\4</em> ‘jadestone.’ Turkish\n<em>hara</em> ‘stud farm’ also means ‘stone, marble of mottled blue\nor brown.’ Though jade is usually green, it may be whitish,\nand a glance at purple or any other color shows how\nnomadic and unstable color words are. Jasper, for instance,\ncan be brown, gray, green, pepper-and-salt, red, or yellow.\nSo that Turkish <em>hara</em> may well refer to ‘jadestone’-especially\nsince the Turkish word for ‘jade, <em>yeshim</em>, means ‘jasper’\nand ‘porphyry’ as well. <em>Yeshim</em> probably derives from <em>yeshil</em>\n‘green’ and <em>yash</em> ‘verdant.’ Another Turkish word, <em>toy</em>,\nmeans not just ‘green’ but also the ‘greater bustard, bittern,\nnight heron.’ <em>Toygan</em> means ‘falcon, hawk’; <em>toynak</em> ‘hoof’;\n<em>tirnak</em> ‘claw’; <em>tirmiklamak</em> ‘to rake, harrow’; <em>tay</em> ‘colt’-\nwhich trots us off to English <em>hagdon</em>, <em>haggard</em>, <em>haglet</em>, <em>harrier</em>, and <em>hawk</em>.</p>\n<p>What we seem to be looking at here is a hostile horde\nof herdsmen-horsemen who hunt with hawks when they're\nnot hacking at and harassing their neighbors. These harsh\nharriers are roving reavers, haiduks who appear as suddenly\nas nightmares, wreak their havoc and then vanish as if by\nmagic. Though nothing like as harrowed and hag-ridden as\nthe pedestrian peoples in their path, both nags and riders,\nwhat with all that raiking and roaming, do become jaded-the\nriders especially, since, however hardy a jaunting\nmarauder may be, jouncing about on jades is harmful to the\nhealth. For the resulting kidney disorders-among them,\nrenal colic-there is, we are happy to report, a specific: the\nwearing of nephrite, either alone or in combination with a\n<em>hagstone</em> which, because of its unevenness, may, even more\nthan the yellowish-bluish-grayish-whitish-green jade, resemble\nand, therefore, protect against kidney stone.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
