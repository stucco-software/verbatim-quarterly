Any suggestions?</p>\n<p>While pondering this terminological lacuna, those\nof either sex who are interested in word origins may\nbe intrigued to know that the pre-Germanic sources\nof both the two words <em>wife</em> and <em>man</em> remain etymological\npuzzles.</p>\n<p>There are, however, several reconstructed Proto-Indo-European\nroots from which English <em>wife</em> and\n<em>man</em> can be derived without patent violation of known\nphonological, morphological, or semantic laws of probability.\nFor <em>wife</em>, there are seven such roots, which,\nthough homonymous, were presumably distinct in\nmeaning and in usage.  They are:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>root</em></th>\n<th><em>meaning of root</em></th>\n<th><em>meaning of derived noun</em></th>\n<th><em>related English derivative</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>wey</em>- 1</td>\n<td>'turn', 'twist'</td>\n<td>(a) 'weaver', 'spinner'  (b) 'hip-swiveler'  (c) 'flickle person'</td>\n<td>(a,b) wire (G),  (c) vibrate (I)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>wey</em>- 2</td>\n<td>'drip', 'flow'</td>\n<td>'menstruator'</td>\n<td>ooze (G) , virus (I)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>wey</em>- 3</td>\n<td>'grow,' 'sprout'</td>\n<td>'gestator'</td>\n<td>(only <em>wife</em> itself: G)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>wey</em>- 4</td>\n<td>'magic,' 'sorcery'</td>\n<td>'witch'</td>\n<td>witch (G)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>wey</em>- 5</td>\n<td>'fault,' 'defect'</td>\n<td>'weaker sex'</td>\n<td>vice (I)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>wey</em>- 6</td>\n<td>'strong,' 'vigorous'</td>\n<td>'person of stamina'</td>\n<td>vim (I)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>wey</em>- 7</td>\n<td>'wither,' 'wrinkle'</td>\n<td>'one who (both blooms and) ages rapidly'</td>\n<td>wizen (G)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For <em>man</em>, there are three plausible root sources, as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>root</em></th>\n<th><em>meaning of root</em></th>\n<th><em>meaning of derived noun</em></th>\n<th><em>related English derivative</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>men</em>-</td>\n<td>'think'</td>\n<td>'reasoner'</td>\n<td>mind (G),  mental (I)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>man</em>-</td>\n<td>'hand'</td>\n<td>'manipulator'</td>\n<td>manual (I)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*<em>mon</em>-</td>\n<td>'man'</td>\n<td>'human being'</td>\n<td>man (G)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>G</em> means “coming into English by way of Germanic (Anglo-Saxon or Old Norse).”<br>\n<em>I</em> means “coming into English by way of Italic (Latin or French).”</p>",
