With the written language, this is\northographically facilitated by the various processes\nof word shortening—acronyms (<em>ZIP</em> for <em>Zone Improvement\nPlan</em>), contractions (<em>won't for will not</em>),\nclipped words (<em>deli</em> for <em>delicatessen</em>) and abbreviations\n(<em>lb.</em> for <em>pound</em>).  However, the time- and space-saving\nact of abbreviating is not always working with\nthe efficiency that was originally intended.  A few\nexamples will vividly illustrate this puzzling discrepancy.</p>\n<p>When we find ourselves with a long word or\nphrase on our hands, we would normally expect to\nfind an abbreviation to come to the rescue.  In time,\nthat generally happens and, with few communication\ndifficulties, everything lives happily after.  The\nexpression, <em>master of the ceremonies</em>, is earliest\nfound in 1662.  It is more than a hundred years later\nbefore an efficient abbreviation for it is found.  In\n1790 <em>M.C.</em> finally arrives in print to reduce the writing\nwordload by 300 percent.  Supposedly, everything\nis firmly set.  For almost one and one half centuries,\nM.C. does the job it was called upon to do.  In\n1933, however, some writer mysteriously decides\nthat a new word is needed to represent the pronunciation\nof the abbreviation.  <em>Emcee</em> is thus born, no\nmatter that this represents an increase from two letters\nto five, a bulging 125% growth.  Granted, <em>emcee</em>\nis still more efficient than <em>master of ceremonies</em>, but\nthe need for spelling out the sound of letters seems\nredundant, superfluous, and therefore useless.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the practice of changing from\nterm to abbreviation to phonetic spelling of the abbreviation\nis an old and continuing oddity in English.\nIn World War II, the need for a general-purpose vehicle\nwas satisfied with the development of a means\nof transportation referred to by the government\nwith astonishing directness and candor as a <em>general-purpose\nvehicle</em>.  The army, quick to abbreviate everything,\nbegan to refer to the vehicle as a g.p., but\nby 1941 g.p. had given way to the longer <em>jeep</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Vice president</em> (with no capitals is first found in\n1574, and <em>Vice President</em>, referring to his USA nibs,\nis found in 1787.  Sometime later <em>VP</em> shortened the\nterm by 250%, but by 1949 <em>veep</em>, although abhorred\nby many, was applied affectionately to Alben Barclay\nand became part of the written and spoken\nvocabulary.</p>\n<p><em>Junior varsity</em> is found in 1949, referring to the\nsecondary team of an American school or university.\nThe date for the first use of J.V. is unsure, but the\ndate for <em>jayvee</em>, 1937, would seem to show a lack of\nconclusive evidence since <em>junior varsity</em> must obviously\nhave preceded <em>jayvee</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Disc jockey</em> is found in 1941, <em>deejay</em> in 1949,\nindicating that D.J. might have been in between.</p>\n<p>Another inconsistency is to be found in the process\nof <em>knockout</em>, the boxing term and later the metaphoric\nterm referring to anything that amazes or\nshocks.  <em>Knockout</em> is first recorded in 1887, and logically\nfollowing is K.O. in 1926, but the first appearance\nof <em>kayo</em> is cited in 1923.</p>\n<p>Not to rehash the OK controversy, but <em>oll korrect</em>\nis first found in 1839 with OK also listed in that\nsame year.  Following reasonable suit, <em>okeh</em> appears\nin 1919, and <em>okay</em> is charted in 1929.</p>\n<p>One segment of the armed forces is the Construction\nBatallion, which was quickly abbreviated\nto <em>C.B.</em>  In 1942 this group came to be known as the\n<em>Seabees</em>, sporting uniforms with an appropriate insigne\nof a seafaring bee.</p>\n<p>One of the latest words to enter the Abbreviation\nCycle of Redundancy Race is <em>Missouri</em>.  The\n“Show-Me” state gained statehood in 1821.  It is not\nclear when the inept Mo. became the official abbreviation.\nHowever it is, the Postal Service saw fit to\ncontinue the curse with MO.  The final stage is now\nevident in the state's motto regarding drugs: “MO\nSAYS NO TO DRUGS,” where MO is obviously to be\nrhymed with NO.</p>\n<p>What are the reasons for the apparent senselessness\nin the preceding examples?  It must first be remembered\nthat English is not highly reliant on the\nrules of logic.  Prescriptive dictionaries are becoming\nfewer; descriptive dictionaries are gaining in\npopularity.  Aside from generalizations, however,\nthe abbreviations considered here do present some\nreason for their madness.  Mo rhyming with no certainly\nmakes the slogan easy to remember.  <em>Jeep</em> and\n<em>veep</em>, each containing only one syllable, are easier to\npronounce than their ancestral abbreviations.  <em>Emcee</em>\nprobably radiates a more euphemistic aura of\ndignity than M.C.  Although there seems to be no\nreason for <em>jayvee</em>, it must be noted that the date\ngiven for the first appearance of a word is actually a\nrecord of when it was first found in print, and earlier\noral use could not distinguish <em>J. V.</em> from <em>jayvee</em>.  The\nword was no doubt used orally much earlier.</p>\n<p>The problem with abbreviations as presented\nhere again illustrates that people demand that language\nwork the way they want to make it work.\nOverall, the abbreviating process is alive and doing\nexceptionally well.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
