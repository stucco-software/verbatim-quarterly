We were driving to the beach with\nFlorence's daughter, now aged ten herself.  As we\ncrossed the bridge to Atlantic Beach, she looked out at\nthe unfamiliar neighborhood and said, “I wonder\nwhere's <em>the kids who live around here's school</em>.”</p>\n<p>Soon after that, I was calling for a friend, en route to\ndinner.  As I helped her on with her coat, she began\ndescribing her day at the office.  “I'm working on an\ninterview with Lily Daché,” she said.  “Did you know\nthat she's <em>the head of Coty's wife?</em>”</p>\n<p>My recollection of grammatical designations was a\nbit hazy.  I vaguely remembered my English teacher's\nreference to past imperfect and future subjunctive.  The\nonly term I could come up with for this trait was\n<em>retarded possessive</em>.</p>\n<p>Soon, the usage came naturally.  I was describing\nholiday weekends in a wooded area of Eastern Massachusetts.\n“We used to go into the general store in\nBuzzard's Bay on Labor Day,” I said, “to buy <em>the day\nbefore's New York Times</em>.”</p>\n<p>Apparently, I was not the only collector of the late,\nlate apostrophe.  H. Allen Smith, always one to savor\nlanguage quirks, reached 'way back to the network radio\nera.  Colonel Stoopnagle and Budd, he wrote, had also\nfancied the construction and devised this for one of their\nbroadcasts: “That man over there is <em>the woman whose\npenthouse we went up to the other night's brother-in-law</em>.”</p>\n<p>Now, what I'd really like to learn is the people who\nusually get to read this quarterly's reactions.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
