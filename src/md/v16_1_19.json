The situation in the U.S. is “improving”—if\nthat is the correct word—in that some\nTV films I have seen there recently have not had the\nnaughty bits bleeped out.

A rude word is, of course,\nalways a rude word, and the “right time” is somewhat\narbitrary: it is not as though everyone is not familiar\nwith the rude words; indeed, those who object to them\nthe most are not likely to be in bed by nine o'clock.\nThe feeling, one assumes, is that broadcasting them,\nregardless of context, at times when children are listening,\nlends rude words a patina of approval that\ninures them to the corrosive atmosphere of taboo.\nThus, when uttered by an actor whose thumb has just\nbeen struck by a hammer or who has suffered some\nfrustration or other outrage, any of several four-letter\nwords seem as natural as in real life.

As many of the British comedians\neither speak with thick North or West Country\naccents, mumble, talk too fast, or all three, it is sometimes\ndifficult to understand what they (and their\naudiences) are on about.
