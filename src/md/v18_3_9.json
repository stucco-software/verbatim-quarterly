Why make a crazy statement\nlike “It makes beautiful,” for “It's nice weather”?\nAnd so on.</p>\n<p>I was recently reminded of all this while boning\nup on my Spanish before traveling with my husband\nto Central America.  <em>Y no tengo pelos en la lengua</em>\n('And I don't have hair on my tongue: I'm telling you\nwhat I think'), that is, <em>llamo al pan pan, y al vino vino</em>\n('I'm calling bread bread and wine wine: I'm calling\na spade a spade')—it's a <em>muy</em> fascinating language!</p>\n<p>In the years since my youthful folly, I have become\nentranced with the splendid beauty of the\nSpanish tongue.  And once again, as I have refreshed\nmy memory, I have savored the picturesque idiosyncratic\nverbal constructions of the language.  Who\ncannot become enmeshed in the rich rolling of r's in\na word like 'railroad,' <em>ferrocarril?</em>  How could one\nnot be astounded by the funny logic of, say, meeting\none's match by encountering the shoestring of one's\nshoe: <em>encontrarse con la herma de su zapato?</em>  Or\nwho could fail to be entertained while attempting\n<em>trabalenguas</em> ('troubled tongues: tongue twisters')\nlike: <em>Yo no compro coco.  Porque como poco coco,\npoco coco compro</em>.  ('I don't buy coconut.  Since I eat\nlittle coconut, I buy little coconut.'), and <em>Mi mama\nme mima mucho</em>.  ('My mother spoils me a lot.')?</p>\n<p>Noah Jonathan Jacobs speaks about “the universality\nof linguistic chauvinism”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We characterize unintelligible speech by saying,\n“That's Greek to me,” the Russians and Rumanians\nby “That's Chinese to me,” the French by\n“That's Hebrew to me,” the Germans by “That's\nSpanish to me,” and the Poles by “I'm listening\nto a Turkish sermon.”</p>\n<p>[<em>Naming Day in Eden</em>, Noah Jonathon Jacobs, p. 60]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Casting aspersions on them, as opposed to us,\nfinds Spanish-speakers no exceptions to the rule.\nTake, for instance, the various ways they characterize\nthe concept of “playing dumb”: In Bolivia it is\n“to become an Italian”: <em>hacerse el italiano</em>; in Colombia\nthe English get it with <em>hacerse el inglés</em>; in\nMexico one becomes a gourd—<em>hacerse guaje</em>—and\nEl Salvador's <em>hacerse el papo</em> equates playing the\nfool with one who has a double chin; <em>hacerse chino</em> in\nEquador means 'to fool someone [by acting like a\nChinese].'</p>\n<p>On the Continent it is bad' cess to the British,\nfor in Spain if you are 'surrounded by Englishmen'\nyou are being dunned to pay your bills.  “Working\nfor the English” means you earn a mere pittance.  <em>Ir\na la alemana</em> 'to go German' is the equivalent of our\n<em>Dutch treat</em>.  And dull wit is <em>un chiste alemán</em> 'a German\njoke.'</p>\n<p>If one 'has a rat' or 'catches a Turk' in Spain\n(<em>tener un ratón; coger una turca</em>) he gets drunk.  (<em>Una\nturca</em> is also 'a liar.')  Getting drunk in Panama, on\nthe other hand, is <em>estar en fuego</em> 'to be on fire.'</p>\n<p>The Basques take verbal beating too, for in\nSpain <em>una basqueria</em> is 'a Basque [a dirty trick].' <em>Vasconcear</em>\ntranslates 'to speak Basque, to jabber.' I suspect\n<em>basquear</em> 'to be nauseated' has the same source.\nAnd if the cost is not clear, <em>hay moros en la costa</em>\n'there are Moors on the coast.'</p>\n<p>Insult is not limited just to other nationalities,\neither.  To a Spanish-speaker, a noisy party is <em>una\nboda de negros</em> 'a Negro wedding.'  <em>Se armó la de\nSan Quintin</em> indicates a terrible row has taken place.</p>\n<p>Adding diminutive suffixes is often a disparaging\ntactic.  For instance, add-<em>illo</em> to a respected lawyer,\n<em>abogado</em>, and you have an ignorant one, <em>un abogadillo</em>.\nThe small-town mentality is derided in the\nuse of <em>aldeanismo</em>, an <em>aldea</em> being a 'small village.'</p>\n<p>And there is a whole array of American barrio\nslang to tickle one's fancy.  For example, <em>La chata</em> is\nan affectionate slang term meaning 'funny face,'\n'honey,' or 'cutie,' but in Central America or Spain a\nfellow would probably be punched out if he were to\ncall his girl a 'bedpan' or 'barge'!</p>\n<p>The animal world figures prominently in many\nSpanish idioms.  If you want to be the life of the\nparty, it is necessary <em>ser el pato de la boda</em> 'to be the\nwedding duck.'  There is <em>Que mosca te ha picado?</em>\n'What fly has bitten you?: What is eating you?' <em>El\ngusano de la conciencia</em> is 'the worm of the conscience,'\nremorse.  'To play the red owl' (<em>tocar el\nmochelo</em>) is to get the worst end of something.</p>\n<p><em>Aquí hay gato encerrado</em> 'There is a locked-up\ncat here'='I smell a rat,' <em>meter gato por liebre</em> 'to\nput a cat in the place of a hare'='to be taken in,'\nand <em>buscar tres pies al gato</em> 'to look for three feet on\nthe cat'='to look for trouble' are three feline\nphrases.</p>\n<p>Spanish cursing and swearing is inventive—\n<em>echar sapos y culebras</em> literally, means 'to throw out\nfrogs and snakes.'  Such behaviour usually ends up\nwith having to pay the piper, that is, <em>pagar los platos\nrotos</em> 'to pay for the broken plates.'</p>\n<p>Lest we forget, the “class” way to play hooky is\n<em>hacer vaca</em>, 'to make a cow.'</p>\n<p>Picture <em>una boca de agua</em> 'a water mouth'='a\nfire hydrant,' A person with a closed head ('<em>cerrado\nde cabeza</em>') is certainly narrow-minded.  The title\nVERBATIM could well be translated as <em>Al Pie de la\nLetra</em> 'to the foot of the letter'='word for word'!</p>\n<p>Avoid <em>una media cuchara</em> 'a half spoon,' for he is\na mediocre person indeed.  'Give a pumpkin' <em>dar\ncalabazas</em> if you want to turn down an unsuitable\nsuitor.  Making decisions sometimes requires 'sleeping\non it,' that is, 'conferring with one's pillow,' <em>consultar\ncon la almohada</em>.  Speaking of sleeping, in\nSpanish sleeping soundly is 'to sleep like a loose leg'\n<em>dormir a pierna suelta</em>.</p>\n<p>You will be, likely to jump for joy (<em>dar zapatetas</em>\n'to give shoe sole slaps') and go on a spree (<em>echar una\ncana al aire</em> 'to toss gray hair into the air') if you can\ngo shopping 'every other day' <em>un día sí y un día no</em> at\nyour 'rich aunt's.' i.e. <em>tía rica</em> ([Am. Spanish] 'rich\naunt'='pawn shop').  That is, unless one <em>canta alto\n'sings high'</em>='asks too much.'</p>\n<p>Many phrases slip over the tongue like liquid\nvelvet.  There is <em>a tontas y a locas</em> 'stupidly and crazily'='helter-skelter'\nand the similar <em>a troche y\nmoche (or trochemoche)</em>, meaning 'in complete confusion.'\nOr <em>sin ton no son</em> 'without tone or\nsound'='without rhyme or reason.'  <em>Un runrún</em> is 'a\nrumor.'  A popular alcoholic beverage, <em>chicha</em>, figures\nin the saying, <em>Ne chicha ni limonada</em> 'neither\nfish nor fowl.'  'Look high and low' <em>andar de la Ceca\na la Meca</em> and 'in every nook and cranny' <em>de cabo a\nrabo</em>='from tip to tail.'  Show your 'guts', which in\nSpanish is <em>el hígado</em>='the liver.'  To give <em>una\ndedada de miel</em> 'a pinch of honey,' or <em>dar jabón (or\nenjabonar)</em> literally 'to give soap' or 'to wash with\nsoap' you can flatter someone or 'soft-soap' him.</p>\n<p>If your word is no good, you 'paint someone a\nviolin' <em>pintarle un violín</em>.  Empty, idle words are\n'white words' <em>las palabras blancas</em>; I could just be\n'pulling your leg' <em>tomar el pelo</em>, literally, 'to take the\nhair.'</p>\n<p>I can remember being greatly embarrassed once\nwhen I was trying to explain in Spanish about my\nbeing embarrassed, and how shocked my high\nschool <em>amigos</em> were when I announced, they\nthought, that I was pregnant (<em>embarazada</em>).  Incidentally,\nthe last time we were in Guatemala we often\nheard the beautiful expression for 'being pregnant,'\n<em>tener gracia</em> 'to have grace' or 'to be blessed.'</p>\n<p>My uncle recalled a time when in a Mexican restaurant\nhe and his family had waited an overly long\ntime for their order.  He was astonished when his cry\nfor service, “Servesa!” brought beer instead.\n<em>Servesa</em> certainly seemed a reasonable Spanish way\nof saying, “I want service!” but “<em>Cervesa</em>!” will\nbring a brew every time.</p>\n<p>Friends die laughing—that is, they laugh <em>a\nmandíbula batiente</em> 'with their lower jaw beating'—\nwhen we tell them of' the pleasures of living a short\ndistance out of town.  The Spanish speaker would\nsay we live <em>en los quintos infiernos</em> 'in the fifth hell.'\nAnd Cuban friends would say we live <em>donde el diablo\ndió los tres gritos</em> 'where the devil gave three hoots'\nor simply, 'You live in the sticks' “<em>Vive en las\nquimbambas</em>!”</p>\n<p>Well, 'inside of a little' <em>dentro de poco</em>, actually,\n'of a slap' <em>de sopentón</em>, I mean, 'in less than what\nsings a rooster' <em>en menos de lo que un gallo</em>, here it is\ntime to stop.  It would be such fun to discuss other\nthings, but <em>eso es harina de otro costal</em> 'That is flour\nfrom another sack!'</p>",
