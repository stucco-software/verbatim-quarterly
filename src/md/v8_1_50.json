And then, when a crime is committed\nand a “real” <em>suspect</em> is found and arrested— and by\n“real” is meant 'someone who is suspected of the crime but\nno one can be certain he committed it, and he might be let\ngo if insufficient evidence precludes a trial, or, if a trial\ntakes place, he might be acquitted'—applying the empty\nwords <em>alleged</em> or <em>suspected</em> to such an individual prejudices\nhis case to his disfavor more pointedly than to that of the\ncriminal observed in the act.</p>\n<p>A <em>suspect</em> is a <em>suspect</em> is a <em>suspect</em>.  The word is used in\nEnglish <em>mainly</em> to mean 'someone who is suspected of having\ndone something'; <em>suspect</em> (verb) means ' “1. to believe to\nbe guilty ... with insufficient proof or with no proof.  2. to\nbelieve to be rightly chargeable with something stated,\nusually something wrong, ... on little or no evidence.” '\nAlleged means ' “declared or stated to be as described;\nasserted.” '  [Verb and adjective definitions are from the\n<em>Random House Unabridged</em>.]  In strictly legal terms,\nsomething alleged is an <em>allegation,</em> defined as ' “the statement\nof the issue which the contributing party is prepared\nto prove,” ' in Steven H. Gifis's <em>Law Dictionary,</em> Barron's,\n1975.</p>\n<p>Thus, in ordinary English, an <em>allegation</em> is ' “an assertion\nmade without substantial proof,” ' while in legal\nEnglish it is ' “an assertion made by a party in a legal proceeding,\nwhich he undertakes to prove.” '  [Both from <em>RH\nUnabridged</em>.]  Yet, somehow, by virtue of the constant\nrepetition of <em>alleged</em> preceding such words as thief, <em>assassin,\nrapist, murderer, mugger,</em> etc., in the media it has taken on\nthe sense 'we don't <em>know</em> whether he did it or not' rather\nthan 'we haven't yet proven whether he did it or not.'  The\nquestion arises, therefore, whether it makes sense to refer to\ncriminals <em>known</em> to have committed crimes (without a trial)\nas “alleged” criminals: a subsequent release or acquittal does\nnot, necessarily, mean that the defendant did not <em>commit</em>\nthe crime for which he was tried, only that he was <em>not\nfound guilty</em> of it.  That might be for any number of reasons;\na common one in America was that the suspect was not\n“read his rights” at the time of the arrest, a result of the so-called\nMiranda rule [384 U.S. 436, 444-45]; other reasons\nabound.  <em>Alleged</em> appears to have acquired the status of a\nlegal loophole; it allows the media to call anyone anything\nthey please, as long as it is preceded by <em>alleged</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[L.U.]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
