Bowker Company, 1983), xv + 579pp.</p>\n<p>Although no mention is made of it in the section Further\nReading, at the end of the Foreword of the work under review,\n<em>Dictionaries, Encyclopedias, and Other Word-Related Books</em>,\nedited by Annie M. Brewer, Gale Research Company, is a very\nuseful adjunct to this book.  A Supplement to the Third Edition\nwas published recently.  As the title makes clear, <em>World Dictionaries\nin Print (WDP)</em> covers only those works in print.  While\nMrs. Brewer's books are much broader in scope, they are based\non the catalogue at the Library of Congress and hence do not\ninclude some foreign and some American works of reference\nthat are apparently not (yet) in the L.C. collection.</p>\n<p><em>WDP</em> starts out a little confused: it has both a Foreword\nand a Preface (they are, as far as I know, merely Germanic and\nLatin variant names of the same sort of thing).  Although a note\non James Campbell appears at the end of the Foreword, the\nForeword is not attributed to him; at the end of the Preface,\nunder Acknowledgements [<em>sic</em>] appears a note of thanks to\nCampbell for “his excellent essay: 'Suggestions for Acquiring\nForeign Reference Books,' ” though the three paragraphs dealing\nwith that subject appear as part of the Foreword, under the\ntitle “Buying from the Foreign Book Dealer.”</p>\n<p>The book is organized into a Subject Index, Title Index,\nAuthor/Editor/Compiler Index, and a Language Index; the last\n33 pages are devoted to a Key to Publishers' and Distributors'\nAbbreviations.</p>\n<p>In such an array, my first inclination is to seek out my own\nname in the Author/Editor/Compiler Index.  It appears eight\ntimes for only 14 titles, with more than a few errors.  My given\nname is misspelt “Laurance” once and “Lawrence” twice, and\nmy surname is misspelt “Urdung” once [see VERBATIM I, 2].\nIn one instance, an improper cross reference is made to a\nsubeditor; one title is listed twice; and about 60 (yes, <em>60</em>) other\ndictionaries are not listed at all or are miscredited.  Some\nappear under L (for Laurence Urdang Associates, Ltd.), and\none spells my surname “Ordang.”  For example, the following\ntitles are not listed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Collins English Dictionary, Collins</em> [U.K.]</p>\n<p><em>Penguin Dictionary of Electronics, Penguin</em> [U.K.]</p>\n<p><em>Dictionary of Philosophy, Macmillan &amp; Pan</em> [U.K.]</p>\n<p><em>Hamlyn Dictionary of Biblical Quotations, Hamlyn</em>\n[U.K.], Facts on File [U.S.]</p>\n<p><em>Treasury of Biblical Quotations</em>, Nelson [U.S.], Pickering\n[U.S.] &amp; Inglis [U.K.]</p>\n<p><em>Mosby's Medical &amp; Nursing Dictionary</em>, C.V. Mosby</p>\n<p><em>Timetables of American History</em>, Simon &amp; Schuster</p>\n<p><em>Twentieth Century American Nicknames</em>, Wilson<br>\n...etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many of those not listed are British books, but <em>WDP</em> lists other\ntitles that are not readily available in America.  Bowker cannot\nbe held responsible for failing to list, with the proper attribution,\nan editor if the publisher has decided to discontinue\nlisting his name (as in the case of the <em>Random House College\nDictionary</em>, of which I was listed as editor in chief till the 2nd\nEdition was published, containing about 7% new matter,\nwhereupon my name was removed, and the <em>Random House\nUnabridged</em>, of which Jess Stein was listed as editor in chief\nand I as managing editor: neither credit appears in <em>WDP</em>,\ndespite the continued listing on the book's title page).  But\nBowker <em>can</em> be called to task for listing Flexner, Stuart Berg, as\n“Bergflexner, Stuart,” and for numerous other proofreaders'\nand other errors.</p>\n<p>There is much useful information in <em>WDP</em> notwithstanding,\nand the four main indexes make it readily accessible.  Yet\nthere are omissions that are quite unforgivable, like the <em>Shakespeare\nConcordance</em> published by Harvard University Press\n(Belknap), and what is there is not easy to find because of the\nmisspellings.</p>\n<p>In sum, <em>WDP</em> contains a large number of errors and omits\nmany works it ought to have included.  If you can live with that\nsort of frustration, then this book is for you; if not, use the\nGale book referred to earlier or the catalogue of a library with\nan exceptional collection, though neither of the last two is as\nlikely to provide information as up to date as that in <em>WDP</em>—\nalas!</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
