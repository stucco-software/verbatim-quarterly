As a longtime\naficionado in search of foreign examples, I've run\n(backwards, that is) across most of the Greek and\nLatin ones mentioned, and as a matter of (retro)\ncourse, have found a handful in French and Spanish.\nFor example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ésope reste ici et se repose.  'Aesop remains here\nand is resting.'</p>\n<p>Élu par cette crapule 'Elected by that scoundrel'</p>\n<p>L'âme des uns iamais [i.e., jamais] n'use de mal.\n'The soul of some never makes use of evil.'</p>\n<p>Dábale arroz a la zorra el abad.  'The abbot was\ngiving rice to the she-fox [or prostitute, if you\nprefer].'  etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I've always wondered whether some of the more\northographically esoteric languages, with lots of consonant\nclusters, could possibly lend themselves to the\nphenomenon.  It's hard for me to imagine palindromes\nin, say, Polish.</p>\n<p>Colleagues assure me that they do exist in German,\nthough they have yet to come up with any of\nreal substance.  (The compound noun Reliefpfeiler, a\n'column sculpted in relief,' is the best they can do;\nrather feeble stuff, I'd say.)  Others swear that they\nhave seen some in Russian, but suggest that they have\nprobably been stricken from the language as backward\nWesternisms.  A Hebraist tells me that Hebrew creates\npalindromes—prosthendromes?—rather easily, given\nthe absence of written vowels, but hasn't yet supplies\nany examples.</p>\n<p>Be that as it may, thanks to my friend, Joseph\nStasa, I have recently discovered an apparent treasure-trove\nin, of all languages, Czech.  The Ĉeskoslovensky\nSvet of December 1985 documents the work of\none Stanislav Tvrdík, from Praha-Radotin, who has\ncollected some 3500 palindromes—the Czech term is\nráček, the word for the 'backward-walking cray-fish'—of\nwhich well over 2000 are in his native\ntongue.  The following examples display the same\ndelightfully forced logic typical of so many of the\npalindromes we all know and love:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do háje si Jan Aleŝ ŝel a nají se jahod.  'Jan Aleš\nwent to the woods and will eat strawberries.'</p>\n<p>Rád líbil se Vit sleĉnám, Manĉe lstivé slíbil dar.\n'Vit was glad that young ladies like him; he\npromised a gift to the running Manĉa.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, if we accept the ch as an individual grapheme:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do chladu si mísu dal Chod.  'Chod put a bowl in\na cooler.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am assured that Mr. Tvrdik will welcome correspondence\naddressed in care of Ĉeskoslovensky Svêt,\nVinohradská 46, 1200 Praha 2, Czechoslovakia, which\nwill backward all mail to him.</p>\n<p><em>[Norman R.
