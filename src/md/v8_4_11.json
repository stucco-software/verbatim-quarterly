The standard works adopted for use in classes for\nlearners of English avoid the problem, and there must be\nmillions of instances in which new speakers of English have\nhad to endure embarrassment because of lack of knowledge\nabout ambiguous words and because of imperfect pronunciation\nof perfectly harmless words.  An example of the former\nappears on page 13: A foreigner in a sporting goods shop\nenquires of the proprietor, “Do you have red balls?”  The\nspeaker means red tennis balls; the proprietor understands—\nwell, you know.  Examples of the latter (pages 34 and 35)\ninclude, “I put some clean <em>shits</em> on the bed” and “Do you\nmind if I take a <em>piss</em> [of cake]?”  I know of one instance in\nwhich a refined lady, new to America from eastern Europe,\nwas shopping in a drugstore; unable to remember the word\n<em>toothpaste</em>, she asked for “something for brushing my teats,”\nevoking not only laughter but expressions of amazement at\nsuch a diligent obsession for cleanliness.</p>\n<p>For native speakers, as can be seen, this book is good for a\nlot of laughs.  But it is serious business to the neophyte speaker\nof a language that abounds in ambiguities distinguishable only\nwhen used in specific contexts.  Those who know French can\nimagine my consternation at discovering the nature of my\nrequest when I asked a (nice) French lass to <em>baiser</em> me: I\nthought I had said <em>baiser</em>, (and, indeed, I had); I was totally\nunaware of having talked my way right into a French pun.</p>\n<p>Nonnative speakers have a hard time learning to distinguish\ntaboo from standard usages of words like <em>bang, bone,\nbox, can, come, eat, fairy,</em> and many others.  Perhaps there are\nother books that can help them, but I know of none.  Also,\n<em>Dangerous English</em> gives lists of words and phrases in tabular\nform, under such headings as Formal, General Use, Euphemism,\nChildren's Words, Slang, and Vulgar.  A small book, it is\nnot exhaustive and cannot solve every problem that the\nforeigner will encounter.  But it is of some help, at any rate.\nMore than half of the book is occupied by a glossary, and it is a\npity that the words and phrases are not cross-indexed from one\npart of the book to another.  Illustrations of anatomical parts\nand of various bodily functions may not be as important as\nsome of the other information, but they nonetheless provide a\nquick guide to what should be avoided.  A more thorough work\nwould be welcome for those who are learning English, in\nparticular: English dictionaries, unlike those for many other\nlanguages, often avoid naughty words, a reflection of American\nnice-nellyism that would keep such dictionaries out of the\nhands of children, the only native speakers who might need\nthem, and deny their availability to those who are learning the\nlanguage.  <em>Dangerous English</em> is a good start in the right\ndirection; perhaps the author will expand the material for a\nsecond edition.</p>\n<p><em>—Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
