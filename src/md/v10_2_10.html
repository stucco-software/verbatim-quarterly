<p>“British English” is something of a misnomer.  For the
language of Boudicca and Arthur the language of the
Ancient Britons has contributed surprisingly little to the word-stock
of English.  The same is true of three descendants of
Brythonic Celtic, namely Welsh, Cornish, and Breton.  Yet small
though it is, the Brythonic legacy is none the less real for that.
What follows is an exercise in etymological rehabilitation.
Goidelic Celtic has been omitted from the writer's purview
since the Irish and Scots contribution has received a relatively
full lexicological airing.  Budding Gael-diggers are, however,
referred to the following: <em>banshee, bog, brat, brogue, caber,
carrageen, clan, claymore, dudeen, gab, galore, gob, gombeen,
leprechaun, piggin</em> (whose marriage to the Norse <em>wassail</em> is
consummated in the pub name, “Pig and Whistle”), <em>plaid,
ptarmigan, shamrock, shillelagh, slogan, slug</em> 'a mouthful,'
<em>smithereens, spalpeen, sporran, tanist, tory, twig</em> 'to suddenly
understand,' and, of course, <em>whiskey</em>.  Those who detect a
phoney ring to any of these should note that the Irish word for
ring <em>fáinne</em> may well be the etymon of <em>phoney</em>, and is
unreservedly hailed by Thomas Pyles as “the noblest contribution
of Irish to American English.”  The derivation of <em>humbug</em>
from the Irish <em>uim boig</em> 'false coin' would provide a perfect
partner, but it is, alas, groundless.  With the death of Ned
Maddrell in 1974, Manx Gaelic expired as a “mother tongue,”
leaving <em>carvel</em> (a native form of carol) as its only English
epitaph.</p>
<p>Direct Old English borrowings from Brythonic are of the
ground, but extremely thin on it: <em>down, tor, coomb, pool, brock</em>
'badger,' and, with Anglo-Latin mediation, <em>peat</em>.  Strangely
enough, Gaulish, which became extinct shortly after the Roman
conquest, has been a far more prolific source of Celtic loanwords.
About 180 Gaulish words, largely agricultural, were
absorbed into Latin and thence into Old French or its dialects.
By the sixteenth century, a number of these had duly found
their way into English: inter alia, <em>gravel, car, chariot, lawn,
lees, league, crease, marl, skein, sock</em> 'ploughshare,' <em>socket,
truant, vassal, valet, javelin, arpent, gob</em> 'lump, mouthful,'
<em>gobbet</em>, and possibly, via the latter duo, <em>job</em>.  The hypothesis,
subscribed to by Littré, that <em>Druid</em> originates in the Gaulish
<em>derw</em> 'oak' (a druidic deity, sacrament, or both) is certainly
plausible and finds some support in the Welsh spelling
<em>derwydd</em>.</p>
<p>By the end of the sixth century, Brythonic had begun to
separate out into its three constituent parts.  <em>Ass</em> may have
entered Old English via the Old Welsh <em>assen</em>.  However, the
Old Irish <em>asan</em> is also a contender for this honor and, in any
case, we are dealing here with an ultimately Indo-European
root.  The earliest genuinely Welsh borrowing, which appears in
the anonymous <em>Cursor Mundi</em> (ca. 1300), is <em>crag</em>, from the Old
Welsh <em>creik</em> 'rock.'  Later in the fourteenth century, <em>bodkin,
maggot, flannel, bug</em>, and <em>lubber</em> all make their debuts.  <em>Bodkin</em>
is probably connected with either the Welsh <em>bidog</em> 'dagger' or
the synonymous Gaelic <em>biodag</em>.  Though it is now customary to
endow <em>maggot</em> with a Teutonic provenance, it has also been
etymologized as the Middle Welsh <em>maceiad</em>, akin to <em>magiaid</em>
'worms' and <em>magu</em> 'to breed.'  <em>Flannel</em> (originally <em>flanyn</em> or
<em>flannen</em>) almost certainly derives from the Welsh <em>(g) wlanen</em>,
ultimately <em>gwlân</em> 'wool.'  <em>Bug</em> has been traced to the Middle
Welsh <em>bwg</em> 'ghost,' and the eighteenth-century <em>bugaboo</em> finds its
parallel in the Welsh <em>bwcibo</em> 'hobgoblin, scarecrow' and the
Cornish <em>buccaboo</em>.  Similarly, the Welsh <em>bygel</em> may have provided
the English <em>bogle</em>, which, in turn, became the nineteenth-century
<em>bogey</em>.  As with maggot, <em>lubber</em> is usually ascribed a
Teutonic origin, but Skeat, for one, prefers the Middle Welsh
<em>llob</em> 'a dolt' or <em>llabbi</em> 'a stripling.'  Unfortunately, Skeat's
Celtophilia occasionally overreaches itself.  His proposal of <em>llob</em>
as the source of the verb <em>to lob</em>; his assimilation of <em>dudgeon</em> to
the Welsh <em>dygen</em> 'malice' though at the time of <em>dudgeon's</em>
debut, <em>dygen</em> meant 'sadness'; and his attempt to base <em>dandruff</em>
on <em>ton drwg</em> 'bad surface' are all very interesting but ... as the
<em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> tactfully puts it, “historically and
phonetically baseless.”  On firmer ground is <em>coracle</em>, which
occurs in Salesbury's <em>Dictionary in English and Welsh</em> (1547)
as the English equivalent of <em>kwrwgyl</em> 'round boat,' and the
archaeological term <em>cromlech</em>, which is used in Owen's <em>Pembrokeshire</em>
(1603), from the Welsh <em>crom</em> 'circular' <em>llech</em> 'slate.'
<em>Gambrel</em> 'a stick for supporting carcasses' also appears at about
this time.  Probably a loan from Old French, ultimately rooted
in the Celtic <em>cam</em> 'crooked,' it has also been traced directly to
the Welsh <em>cambren</em> 'swingle-tree.'  Interestingly, <em>cam</em> has, in
addition, been posited as the source of the dialectal <em>game</em> or
<em>gammy</em>, meaning 'lame.'  Though this is rejected by the <em>OED</em>
on semantic grounds, it should be noted that <em>cam</em> is a common
Celtic sobriquet for the lame.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Welsh
contribution turns culinary.  <em>Flummery</em> 'a cold oatmeal pudding'
is nothing more than a transliteration of <em>llymru</em>, from the
adjective root <em>llymrig</em> 'harsh, raw.'  The initial “f” is symptomatic
of the English phonetic perplexity with the sibilant
Welsh “ll.”  Shakespeare does, of course, follow the same
escape-route by converting <em>Llywelyn</em> into <em>Fluellen</em>.  <em>Pikelet</em> 'a
type of crumpet' originates purely and simply in the Welsh
<em>bara</em> 'bread' <em>pyglyd</em> 'pitchy.'  It is interesting that the homonymous
<em>pike</em> may well be an Anglo-Saxon borrowing from Insular
Celtic, as evidenced by the Welsh <em>pig</em> 'point' and the Gaelic <em>pig</em>
'pike.'</p>
<p><em>Eisteddfod</em>, which is first used in an English work in 1822,
is, of course, a direct loan from Welsh, meaning literally 'a
sitting or meeting.'  From 1822 we traverse more than a century
into the world of the royal kennels.  <em>Corgi</em>, from <em>cor</em> 'dwarf' <em>ci</em>
'dog,' is first attested in Welsh in 1342, but its entrée into
English had to await royal patronage of the breed in the 1920s.
Before we leave Wales we should, perhaps, give a mention to
<em>lad</em> and <em>lass</em>.  These thirteenth century English entrants have
been the source of much speculation and controversy.  For <em>lad</em>,
one school of thought favors the Irish <em>lath</em> 'youth, champion.'
<em>Lass</em> is then posited as a contraction of <em>laddess</em>, itself formed
from <em>lad</em>.  Henry Bradley, on the other hand, suggests that the
Middle English <em>ladde</em> coincides with the adjectival form of the
past participle of the verb 'to lead,' the original meaning thus
being 'one led in the train of a lord.'  The relation of <em>lass</em> to <em>lad</em>
he sees as merely coincidental, <em>lass</em> probably deriving independently
from the Scandinavian <em>laskw</em> 'unmarried.'  However,
Skeat and his sympathizers understandably plump for the
Middle Welsh <em>llawd</em> 'lad' and <em>llodes</em> 'lass.'  Whatever the
validity of their argument, it is interesting that a Welsh cognate
of <em>llodes herlodes</em> is given by Dr. Johnson as the most
probable origin of that other thirteenth-century entrant, <em>harlot</em>.
Modern etymology does, of course, postulate a link, through
Old French, with the Old German <em>hari</em> 'army': thus the
signification of “camp follower.”  Alas, the same Teutonic root
almost certainly accounts for <em>harbor</em>, thereby putting paid to
George Borrow's attempt to folk-etymologize that word to the
Welsh/Gaelic <em>aber</em> 'riverine estuary or confluence.'</p>
<p>Perhaps Borrow could have still spoken littorally and
more convincingly about <em>quay</em>.  For although mediated by Old
French, it is either of Gaulish origin, or directly from the Old
Breton <em>kai</em> 'fence, enclosure.'  Breton, the descendant of the
language spoken by the sixth-century refugees from Wales and
Cornwall, understandably boasts but a small legacy in English,
and all words have been mediated by French.  <em>Mien</em> possibly
derives from the Old Breton <em>min</em> 'beak, snout' though, like
<em>quay</em>, there may be an older Gaulish provenance.  Again, <em>tan</em>
may have a Gaulish root, or derive from the Breton <em>tann</em> 'an
oak.'  Moving into clearer etymological waters, we encounter
the paradox that whilst Frenchmen have consistently dismissed
Breton as a worthless <em>baragouin</em> 'patois, gibberish,' the origin
of that pejorative is undoubtedly Breton.  The word has been
deployed in French since the late fourteenth century, though
its English importation had to wait till 1613.  Littré gives two
etymologies.  Firstly, the exclamation of Breton soldiers on first
encountering <em>bara gwenn</em> 'white bread.'  Secondly, and more
cogently, the customary supplication of Breton pilgrims to
French innkeepers: <em>bara gwin</em> 'bread, wine.'  The persistence
of the surname <em>Painvin</em> in southeast Brittany provides corroboration
for the latter, though the fact that a whole family in
Roscoff is cognominated <em>Baragwenn</em> lends some credence to
the former.  The nineteenth century witnessed the English
importation of three more Breton words.  Though <em>bijou</em> had, by
the time of its English appropriation, developed the extended
meaning of 'trinket,' it originates in the Breton <em>bizou</em> 'fingerring,'
from <em>biz</em> 'finger.'  We conclude with two archaeological
terms.  <em>Menhir</em> appears in 1840, from the Breton <em>men</em> 'stone' <em>hir</em>
'long.'  <em>Dolmen</em> occurs in Jephson's <em>Brittany</em> in 1859.  Though
almost certainly from the Breton <em>taol</em> 'table' <em>men</em> 'stone,' some
authorities prefer the Cornish <em>tolmên</em> 'hole of stone.'</p>
<p>It is somewhat poignant that if <em>tolmên</em> were, indeed, the
genuine etymon, its Anglicization would have postdated the
expiry of the Cornish tongue by over eighty years.  In 1777,
Dolly Pentreath the last native speaker was interred at
Mousehole cemetery.  Even so, Cornish boasts a more substantial
lexical epitaph than its longer-living cousin, Manx.  As one
might expect, the Cornish legacy fully reflects that region's
piscatorial tradition.  A cookery book dated 1430 includes the
first recorded use of <em>gull</em> in English.  The <em>OED</em> favours the Welsh
<em>gwylan</em> as source, but W.B. Lockwood argues convincingly for
the Middle Cornish <em>gullen</em>, adding that the <em>en</em> was probably
dropped because it was still the plural suffix in the southwestern
English dialects of the time (the Old Welsh <em>assen</em> probably
suffered a similar fate).  It is interesting that the French cognate
<em>goéland</em> emerged from none other than the Breton <em>gwelan</em>.  In
all three Celtic languages, the word finds its root in the verb
<em>weep</em>.  To locate the remaining trio of Cornish loanwords we
must sink beneath the waves.  <em>Brill</em>, European flatfish, appears
in 1481 as a transliteration of the Middle Cornish <em>brŷthel</em> (the
intervocalic “th” is silent), from <em>brŷth</em> 'speckled.'  <em>Wrasse</em> is
probably a late seventeenth-century misspelling of the dialectal
<em>wraffe</em>, ultimately the Cornish <em>(g)wrâgh</em> 'old woman.'  Finally,
and a century later, the mackerel shark makes its alternative
debut as the <em>porbeagle</em>, and, according to the Cornish lexicographer
Morton Nance, owes its misleading canine moniker to
either the Cornish <em>porgh-bügel</em> 'swineherd' or the equally
Cornish <em>porth-bügel</em> 'port herdsman.'</p>
<p>It is, however, on the shores of the New World that the
maritime tradition of the Celtic nations has found its most
exotic lexical manifestation.  In 1568, one hundred men were
put ashore by Sir John Hawkins in the Gulf of Mexico.  In
sworn evidence subsequently published in Peckham's <em>True
Report</em> (1583) and Hakluyt's <em>Principall Navigations</em> (1589), one
of these men David Ingram claimed to have walked some
two thousand miles along Indian trails to the region that is now
Maine.  His peregrinations apparently brought him into contact
with pillars of gold, elephants, red sheep, and a flightless bird:
“exceeding fatte and very delicate meate, they have white
heads, and therefore the Countrey Men call them Penguins.”
The bird was the now-extinct great auk, which was found in
abundance off Newfoundland during the sixteenth century.
The name <em>penguin</em> was later, of course, transferred exclusively
to its cousin in the southern hemisphere.  But it is the unspoken
minor premise of Ingram's “syllogism” that is so exciting,
namely that in Welsh <em>pen</em> means 'head' and <em>gwyn</em> 'white.'  But
why, one may ask, should the indigenous “Countrey Men” use
a <em>Welsh</em> epithet?  In the context of Elizabethan proto-imperialism,
the answer is quite simple.  The Tudors themselves were of
Welsh extraction and only too willing to deploy Welsh mythology
against rival Hispanic claims to the New World.  Thus
Madoc ab Owain Gwynedd an obscure North Walian princeling
whose only factual claim to bardic fame had been his
nautical bent and eventual disappearance at sea was euhemerized
by Tudor propagandists into the pre-Columbian discoverer
of America.  And if, as the story went, Madoc had landed in
America circa 1170 and had introduced, along with Christianity,
the Welsh language, then it was not beyond the bounds of
imagination that vestiges of that language should remain
enshrined in contemporary Indian speech.  Royal patronage of
the Madoc myth did, indeed, enable Welsh writers to indulge
their imaginations almost without limit.  Nahuatl virtually
became a Welsh dialect overnight, and Montezuma a descendant
of Madoc.  Locations as diverse as Curacao (supposedly
from the Welsh <em>croeso</em> 'welcome') and Cairo (Welsh <em>caer</em> 'city')
fell prey to what can only be termed a spate of etymological
irredentism.  Bible-bearing Welsh-speaking Indians were, of
course, being spotted everywhere.  And, throughout, the Welsh
provenance of <em>penguin</em> remained unassailed.  Even a relatively
sober lexicographer like Johnson is willing to reject Grew's
derivation from the Latin <em>pinguis</em> 'fat' in favor of the Welsh
claimant, and, as late as 1755, to uncritically accept his
predecessors' chair-bound conviction that the bird possessed a
white head.  However, the fact that the great auk sported a
black head with merely two white patches should not prompt
us to throw out the etymological baby with the mythopoeic
bathwater.  In the first place, bird names are of notoriously
uncertain application.  One need only refer to <em>albatross, grouse</em>,
and <em>pelican</em>.  Secondly, one may surmise that the label was
originally applied to the snow-capped island on which the auks
were first sighted.  Indeed, early references to <em>penguin</em> are
usually related to the island as well as the bird.</p>
<p>If we discount the possibility of Welsh Indians, we are, of
course, left with the question of whether it was a Welsh, as
opposed to Cornish or Breton mariner who first coined the
neologism.  We shall never know; the lexical outcome would, in
any case, have been identical.  It would be nice to think that it
was none other than Davy Jones, that legendary bugaboo
whose name might itself be a distant echo of <em>Shonee</em>, the Celtic
sea-god.  But perhaps that would be to stretch the “suspension
of disbelief” beyond the bounds of willingness.  And who wants
to be accused of flanneling on behalf of baragouins?  Only an
ass of a lubber!</p>
