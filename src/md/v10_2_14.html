<blockquote>
<p>“So now they have made our English tongue a
gallimaufry or hodgepodge of all other speeches.” 
Edmund Spenser</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I know that some will say it is a mingle tongue.
And why not so much the better, taking the best of
both and the other?” Philip Sidney</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The etymological potpourri that we know as the English
language has unquestionably benefited from the diversity
of its sources.  In the Renaissance, writers of English freely
borrowed foreign words mostly from Latin, French, and
Greek when they sensed lacunae in our word-stock.  Thus
William Caxton, who introduced printing into English in 1477,
is credited in the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> with the first use
of <em>abjure, admiration, affability, apparition, calumnious, capacity,
contumelious, desperate, factor, ingenious, inhuman, nuptial,
quasi, seduce, sumptuous</em>, and <em>turpitude</em>.  Other of
Caxton's loanwords have not fared so well: for example,
<em>exsidion</em> 'extirpation' (a nonce-word), <em>exercite</em> 'army,' <em>magistration</em>
'command' (also a nonce-word).  Sir Thomas Elyot, the
great early 16th-century word-borrower, also had his lexical
successes <em>(animate, attraction, education, excrement, exterior,
frugality, irritate, persist, ruminate</em>) as well as his failures
<em>(allective, applicate, assentatour)</em>.</p>
<p>Amid the xenophilic inundation of the English lexicon
during this period, however, many words were brought into the
language not so much to fill gaps as to satisfy particular writers'
penchants for the far-fetched.  Our historical dictionaries contain
a superabundance of strange and ridiculous formations
(many of which appeared only once in the language), coined by
fervent neologists with little or no sense of the lexical exigencies
of the time.</p>
<p>One such ridiculous word, which surfaced late in the
Renaissance, is <em>celeripedian</em> (Latin <em>celer</em> 'swift' + <em>ped</em>- 'foot'),
meaning 'swift footman.'  Henry Cockeram recorded the word
in his <em>English Dictionarie</em> of 1623.  In fact, Cockeram very
likely coined <em>celeripedians</em>, as at least 200 obsolete verbs are
known only through that work.  Cockeram's brand of whimsical
lexicographic invention (almost an oxymoron) was short-lived,
to the credit of subsequent dictionary makers.</p>
<p>Inevitably, as a result of copious borrowing and because of
the affinities of Indo-European languages, words composed of
analogous etymological elements began to crop up in English.
Some of these were calques, or loan-translations, arrived at
consciously by analogical agglutination.  Thus Dan Michel's
French work <em>Remorse of Conscience</em> was translated anonymously
in approximately 1340 under an analogous title:
<em>Ayenbite of Inwyt</em>.  Dickens, in an essay entitled “The Growth
of English Words,” described the calques in Wycliffe's version
of the New Testament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes Wycliffe employs a Latin word, as Resurrection,
at other times he translates it, the Agen-rysynge
(or again-rising); so also the word Except appears as
Out-taken, thus, Out-taken women and children, for
Except women and children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doubtless many etymological equivalents, unlike those in
Wycliffe's writings, arose unconsciously.  It is often difficult in a
given case to trace whether the Anglo-Saxon analogue was
arrived at purposely or inadvertently.  The best clues occur
where an author uses the Romance term and then glosses it
with the Saxon equivalent; some authors actually refer to their
neologizing and attempt to rationalize it.  In other instances it
seems that the affinities of Indo-European languages, in conjunction
with rampant borrowing, gave rise to the creation of
etymological analogues.  It is interesting to note that, whether
or not consciously derived, many of these analogues, having
coexisted in English for many centuries, retain the same basic
meaning, while others have, to varying degrees, been differentiated
in meaning.  In some instances the connection seems quite
remote.</p>
<p>What follows is a small compilation of etymological synonyms
in English.  One finds that the words composed of the
rarer analogues have generally retained similar senses close to
root meanings.  Those composed of more common morphemes
have often strayed from the literal meanings, so that the
analogous formations now bear little resemblance to one
another.</p>
<p>Whether the etymological synonyms have diverged or
remained constant in meaning, it is useful to enhance our
awareness of equivalences in English affixes and roots, for we
thereby acquire a greater sensitivity to our language, its origins,
and its nuances.  The list should illustrate a point made by
Coleridge more than a hundred fifty years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may be doubted whether a composite language like
the English is not a happier instrument of expression
than a homogeneous one like the German.  We possess
a wonderful richness and variety of modified meanings
in our Saxon and Latin quasi-synonyms, which the
Germans have not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the three columns listed below, such etymological
analogues as are attested are matched horizontally, showing
derivatives from Greek, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon elements,
respectively.  It may be worth pointing out that although
compound words made up of certain elements of another
language exist in English, the “mother tongue” did not
necessarily contain the compounded form, i.e., the compounding
was done in English or French.</p>
