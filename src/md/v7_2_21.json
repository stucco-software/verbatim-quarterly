Faeber's letter [VI, 3] about the\nmeaning <em>redline</em> in connection with military aircraft,\nspecifically during WW II.</p>\n<p>As so often happens, both are correct. The meaning of\nthe term depends on the context. To refresh my understanding,\nI called three friends at Oak Ridge National Laboratory\nwho had been in the Air Corps (now the Air Force)\nduring WW II. Frank Rogers was Crew Chief on a B-24,\nstationed in England. He flew on missions and was responsible\nfor his plane's maintenance. Robert M. Farnham was\nMaintenance Officer with a bombardment squadron stationed\nin North Africa and then in Italy. Frank Harrington\nwas a fighter pilot, first in England and then in France and\nGermany. They all confirmed my understanding.</p>\n<p>In the context of maintenance: A diagonal red line in a\nparticular square on the check sheet indicated that this item\nhad something wrong, but that the plane was fit to fly with\ndue precautions. There was no particular term for this sort\nof <em>redline</em>. “Give it a diagonal red line,” the Maintenance\nOfficer might say.</p>\n<p>However, in the context of actually flying a military\nplane, certain instruments had a red line at a critical value:\nair speed, engine rpm, oil pressure, intake manifold\npressure, etc. These values were not to be exceeded in non-emergency\noperation. Of course, in an emergency there\nwere no rules. Frank Harrington gave me a spontaneous example\nwhen I finally got him to recount an incident from\nhis service. There were two German fighters on his tail. He\nwas in gunsights whether he turned right or left. “I dove the\nson-of-a-bitch 'til the wings were ready to come off. I\n<em>redlined</em> everything—air speed, rpm, manifold pressure. At\na thousand feet I throttled back, pulled up. They flew over\nme so close I could read the print on their tires. One of\nthem hit a smokestack and burned. I got the other with a\nburst right in the belly.”</p>\n<p>According to Frank, when a pilot <em>redlined</em> any instrument\nor function in an emergency, he was supposed to\nreport it to the maintenance people so the plane could be\nchecked out, so it could be <em>redlined</em> if anything important\nhad been damaged.</p>\n<p>There is a third usage of <em>redline</em> in the military. In the\nArmy, payday is a formal affair at which each soldier\npresents himself in turn at. the pay table, salutes, announces\nhis name, signs the payroll, and is given his pay. But if a\nsoldier does not present himself for whatever reason—\nAWOL, in the hospital, on detached duty, etc.—or if there\nis anything wrong with the entry on the line containing his\nname, he is redlined by having a horizontal red line drawn\ncompletely across the entry. In that event, he is not paid\nthen and there, though he can usually get at least part of his\npay before the next payday. But that provides slight immediate\ncomfort, and being <em>redlined</em> can be a real tragedy\nin a young soldier's life.</p>\n<p><em>[W. M. Woods, Oak Ridge, Tennessee]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
