## Learned Length and Thund'ring Sound: A Word-Lover's Panegyric
*Bryan A. Garner, Austin, Texas*

>That style is...most perfect, not, as fools say,
which is the most natural, for the most natural is the
disjointed babble of the chronicler; but which attains
the highest degree of elegant and pregnant implication
unobtrusively; or if obtrusively, then with the greatest
gain to sense and vigour.
>
>Robert Louis Stevenson

For many years now it has been dinned into the minds of
high-school and college English students that one quality
stands preeminent in the pursuit of a good prose style:
simplicity.  Ostensibly for the sake of clear communication, this
simplicity is usually supposed to manifest itself in the choice of
plain words.  The corollary of this relatively unexamined precept
is that the introduction of difficult words into one's
writing or speech is a grave stylistic fault.  English textbooks are
not alone, however, in stigmatizing whatever is not readily
understandable to everyone, for one often hears complaints
about the use of hard words.  Recently an acquaintance of
mine, a law student and Phi Beta Kappa graduate of a
prestigious university, told me that she would not renew her
subscription to *Newsweek* because the frequency of words she
didn't know irritated her.

Americans today are as averse as any nation to unfamiliar
words, which seem to proclaim intellectual pretension, flaunted
knowledge, or cultural snobbery—and this if they are used well!
Yet hard words have a reputable literary tradition, even if a
foreshortened one.  English inherited two strains of literary
expression, both deriving ultimately from Ciceronian Latin.  On
the one hand is the plain style now in vogue, characterized by
unadorned vocabulary, directness, unelaborate syntax, and
earthiness.  (This style is known to scholars as Atticism.)  On the
other hand we have the grand style, which exemplifies floridity,
allusiveness, formal, sometimes abstruse diction, and rhetorical
ornament.  Proponents of this verbally richer style (called
Asiaticism) proudly claim that the nuances available in the
&ldquo;oriental profusion&rdquo; of English synonyms make the language
an ideal putty for the skilled linguistic craftsman to mold and
shape precisely in accordance with his conceptions.

The bases of these two styles—now differentiated primarily
by vocabulary, but also by syntax—are still firmly rooted in the
public consciousness.  We have not only the many old saws that
bespeak the maidenly virtues of simple language, but also the
books: for example, those by Gowers and Flesch, among others.
Likewise our bookstores and libraries contain reference sections
teeming with dictionaries of hard words and manuals on how
to increase one's vocabulary, wherein introductory essays
inform us of the many advantages to be enjoyed if only we
would expend the effort to learn new words.  Here is the
standard formula: having increased your command of words,
you become more articulate, and hence will acquire a better
job and gain the respect and admiration of your colleagues.

Now, the Asiaticist views the opulence of our language as
providing apposite terms for virtually every conceivable context.
Still, using the abundant resources of English is widely, if
not wisely, discouraged.  This attitude is as old as Modern
English.  During the sixteenth century, when our language had
just begun to take its modern form, learned Englishmen who
enriched their lexically impoverished tongue with Latin and
Greek loanwords were vilified as &ldquo;smelling of the inkhorn&rdquo; or
as &ldquo;inkhornists.&rdquo;  Thus one of the more notable borrowing
neologists of the Renaissance, Sir Thomas Elyot, author of *The
Governour*, wrote in 1531: &ldquo;Divers men, rather scornyng my
benefite ['beneficence,' i.e, adding to the English word-stock]
than receyving it thankfully, doo shew them selves offended (as
they say) with my straunge termes.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;straunge termes&rdquo;
this redoubtable inkhornist gave us include *accommodate,
education, frugality, irritate, metamorphosis, persist*, and *ruminate*.
He sought not to parade his formidable erudition, but
rather &ldquo;to augment our Englyshe tongue, wherby men shulde
as well expresse more abundantly the thynge that they conceyved
in their hartis (wherefore language was ordeyned)
havinge wordes apte for the purpose.&rdquo;  In retrospect, of course,
the noble efforts of Elyot and others like him were not in vain.

But sesquipedalophobia ('hatred or fear of big words,'
aptly enough) has prevailed, even among men of learning.
Writers on style often find English words of foreign derivation,
like those introduced by Elyot, particularly objectionable.  Thus
H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler on the first page of *The King's
English:*

>Prefer the familiar word to the far-fetched.  
Prefer the concrete word to the abstract.  
Prefer the single word to the circumlocution.  
Prefer the short word to the long.  
Prefer the Saxon word to the Romance.

If by &ldquo;preferences&rdquo; the Fowlers meant mere velleities, then the
soundness of these principles is unassailable.  As stated, however,
they might be considered simplistic and confusing.  The
Fowlers' inconsistency between theory and practice is more
proximate than might be obvious: the first three of their axioms
contain no fewer than eight Latinisms.  One is reminded of the
subtle mockery of this sentence quoted by Joseph T. Shipley in
*In Praise of English*, and perhaps inspired by the Fowler
brothers: &ldquo;Avoid Latin derivatives; use brief, terse, Anglo-Saxon
monosyllables,&rdquo; in which *Anglo-Saxon* is the only Anglo-Saxon
word.

Sheridan Baker, author of *The Practical Stylist*, takes a
much more reasonable approach to the Latin Quarter (or, more
precisely, three-quarters) of the English language.  He writes:

>&ldquo;What we need is a mixed diction,&rdquo; said Aristotle,
and his point remains true twenty-three centuries and
several languages later.  The aim of style, he says, is to
be clear but distinguished.  For clarity we need common,
current words; but used alone, these are commonplace,
and as ephemeral as everyday talk.  For
distinction we need unusual words, metaphors; but used
alone, these become gibberish.  What we need is a diction
that marries the popular with the dignified, the
clear with the sedgy margins of language and thought.

Intermingling substantial Saxon words with those from
Latin gives language variety, texture, euphony, and vitality.
The best writers match substance with impeccable form.  They
use language precisely, evocatively, even daringly.  Thus one
must not assume that Hemingwayan spartanism is the only
desirable mode, unless one is ready to indict T. S. Eliot,
Mencken, Nabokov, Edmund Wilson, John Updike, and many
another masterly writer for dabbling in sesquipedality.

Having established a reputable pedigree for the judicious
employment of unfamiliar words, we can approach a standard
for discriminating between useful and relatively useless
abstrusities.  For the purpose of making such judgments, I offer
a single criterion.  Consider words as analogues to mathematical
fractions, both being symbols for material or conceptual referents:
would a self-respecting mathematician say 12/48 instead
of 1/4 just to sound more erudite?  Certainly not.  Likewise a
writer or speaker generally should not say *obtund* when the
verbs *dull* and *blunt* come more readily to mind.  Nor would
one say *saponaceous* for *soapy, dyslogistic* for *uncomplimentary*,
or *macrobian* (or *longevous*) for *long-lived*.  In language,
however, there are the additional considerations of tone and
context which are largely absent in mathematics.

It is impossible to set down absolute rules about words
that are and are not useful.  Still, it is clearly pedantic to avoid
the obvious by clothing it in befogged terminology, as one
might by writing *arenaceous* or *sabulous* for *sandy, immund*
for *dirty, nates* for *buttocks*, or *venenate* for *poison* (vb.).  In the
words of Coleridge, &ldquo;Whatever is translatable in other and
simpler words of the same language, without loss of sense or
dignity, is bad.&rdquo;

But what of the mathematician who arrives at 15/16?
Should he, for the sake of convenience and easier comprehension,
round off the fraction to 1?  Not if he is concerned with
precision.  (One is reminded of the school district in the deep
south that once decided that 3.14159 was too much for
children to learn and therefore stipulated that the value of pi
was 3.  Or worse, of the midwestern state legislature that, in
1896, set pi equal to 4.)  Likewise with the writer who, when
describing an asthenic person, should not balk at using *asthenic*
rather than the vaguer *weak*, for the former evokes the distinct
image of muscular atrophy, which the latter lacks.  And why
engage in cumbersome periphrases, when a single word will
neatly suffice?

One could make similar arguments for thousands of other
English words.  *Coterie* and *galere* have almost identical meanings—something
like 'a group of persons united for a common
interest or purpose'—but no everyday word exists for this
notion.  The same is true of *cathexis, eirenicon, gravamen,
obelize, oriflamme, protreptic*, or any of numberless other
examples.  Samuel Johnson came closest to rationalizing his
sesquipedalian penchant when he wrote: &ldquo;It is natural to
depart from familiarity of language upon occasions not familiar.
Whatever elevates the sentiments will consequently raise
the expression; whatever fills us with hope or terror, will
produce some perturbation of images and some figurative
distortions of phrase.&rdquo;

Certainly one may have occasion to flirt with abstruse
vocabulary for reasons other than stylistic dignity or the lack of
a simpler term.  I shall adduce three.  First, it is often desirable
to avoid the apt but voguish word.  To select one of several
examples, in the days when *aggravate* was first coming to be
widely used for 'irritate, annoy,' the fastidious speaker or writer
could either combat the word's debasement and use it correctly,
or seek refuge in *exacerbate*.  But now that this term has
become so overworked in journalese and governmentese, he
probably must eschew it altogether.  Perhaps, ironically, a mere
&ldquo;make worse&rdquo; will now have to do.

Second, big words can often have a very humorous effect,
though of course the fun is limited to those who can understand
them.  Such jocular phrases as *campanologist's tintinnabulation*
'bell-ringer's knell,' *galliaceous halitosis* 'garlic breath,'
*pernoctative nepotation* 'riotous carousing through the night,'
*bromidrotic fug* 'sweaty stench,' and *dasypygal demimondaine*
'hairy-rumped prostitute' can be delightfully amusing.

A third reason for waxing lexiphanic is to soften one's
scurrility—to abstract it so that one's audience does not immediately
visualize an unpleasant image.  A political analyst
recently used *fecalbuccal*, an ingenious coinage to describe
certain politicians, for such a purpose.

But enough of this rhapsodizing on sesquipedality.  Americans
have a folk saying that runs: &ldquo;He is a wise man who will
use a short word where a long word might do.&rdquo;  All right.  But
we should also recognize that he is a man of sapience and
discernment who will use a big word where there is no
adequate substitute, rather than pander his meaning to the
sacrosanct monosyllable.  And anyone who naysays this proposition
is merely an addlepated ultracrepidarian!


### OBITER DICTA: *Grammar vs. Common Sense*
*Laurence Urdang*

We all greet with great glee the discovery of what are
formally called misplaced modifiers, somewhat less formally
dangling participles, and colloquially danglers.  Most of them
are funny, like these, which I have saved from students' essays
of long ago, when I was (still) trying to make my way in
akademia:

>Plunging one thousand feet into the gorge, we saw
Yosemite Falls.
>
>When a small boy, a girl is of little interest.
>
Breaking into the girls' dormitory, the dean of men surprised
five members of the football team.

Although such items are, strictly speaking, not reflective of
the best of English style, to maintain that they create nonsense
is going a bit far.  Despite their construction, we readily
understand that it was not we but Yosemite Falls that was
doing the plunging, that a girl is not—or, only very rarely—a
small boy, and that it was the members of the football team,
not the dean, who broke into the girls' dorm (though, it must
be admitted, the footballers would have been surprised either
way).  Here is one from the august [London] *Times* of October
5, 1983:

>Mr. Tom McNally, a Lancashire businessman attempting
to cross the Atlantic in a yacht only 6 ft 10 in
long, is apparently refusing to give up his lone voyage
after being found, in a search involving three nations
without food and water 920 miles off Land's End.

...And no, there is no comma after *nations*.  Yet, we all know
that *without food and water* modifies *Mr. McNally* and not
*three nations:* notwithstanding the syntax, it simply makes no
sense to talk about &ldquo;three nations without food and water.&rdquo;

Linguists maintain that the essential function of language
is to communicate, and there is little doubt that most—but, it
must be allowed, not all—examples of misplaced modifiers do,
indeed, communicate their meaning; however ludicrous the
&ldquo;technical&rdquo; ambiguities, which we may continue to regard with
amusement, there is no reason to express any genuine concern
that language is failing to fulfill its function, especially since, in
other respects, we expect it to be oblique, suggestive, metaphoric,
redundant, and, generally, to allow its speakers to avail
themselves of every possible rhetorical device.

## The Meaning of Personal Names
*Daniel Dorff, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania*

Personal names are often assumed to have no real meaning,
at least in Western culture; but this assumption is a
common oversight.  While personal names cannot be defined in
a lexical sense, they do communicate some ideas about the
people to whom they belong.  Because names reflect a parental
choice and are a constant source of a person's responses and
responsibilities, they cannot be truly random or meaningless.

Starting from an infinite list of possibilities, a small choice
is all that is ever considered.  It is feasible to use any label for a
personal name, but *Tyrannosaurus, 12-54738*, and *Qxxzyelr* are
unlikely, since they do not fit the class of standard names that
we take for granted.  Some real names, such as *Fido* and *Rover*,
are so consistently used for dogs that to name a child *Fido*
would be highly insulting, as well as confusing.  Another similar
convention is the implication of gender through personal
names.  While some names are equally common, or at least
acceptable for either men or women (sometimes with different
spellings), the majority of given names are sex-specific.  If I
introduce *John* and *Mary* to another guest at a party, there
would be no need to specify who's who, but there would be if I
were presenting *John* and *Tom*.  This presupposes a traditional
assigning of names.  It is unlikely that *John* and *Tom* are both
women, because conventions are rarely broken in this respect
for various &ldquo;good&rdquo; reasons.  Ayn Rand's &ldquo;Anthem&rdquo; and Johnny
Cash's &ldquo;A Boy Named Sue&rdquo; successfully violate the above rules
to make us sympathize with their protagonists.

At this party I introduce *John, Johann, Juan, Iannis, Jean*,
and *Ian* to a blind man.  Without visual cues, before speaking to
these people, he may assume not only that these are all human
males, but also that one is German, one Hispanic, Greek,
French, and British, or at least from families of these backgrounds.
There is no grammatical (or other) rule preventing a
Parisian from calling himself *Juan*, but he must expect to
appear Spanish.

For exactly this reason, pseudonyms can be a constructive
tool.  Opera singers from Brooklyn may (and do) take Italian
forms of their names, just as *Giuseppe* can open up a taco
stand in Italy and call himself *Jos&eacute;.  Giuseppe, Joseph*, and *Jos&eacute;*
are all variants of a common model.  Similarly, male-female
pairings such as *Paul-Paula* are forms of one model.  These
cannot be called morphemes, because they do not describe
anything in a lexical sense.  For convenience, this underlying
form can be called a &ldquo;nomeme.&rdquo;  Nomemes do not have to be
restricted to cross-cultural and cross-sexual variation.  Within
the English language, many individual names can be declined
into various forms: *Margaret* becomes *Maggie, Meg, Marge,
Margie, Madge, Peg, Peggy*, and, peripherally, *Gretchen, Gretel*,
or *Greta*.  While this example is a special case, contemporary
English does have three different connotation forms common to
many names: the official-formal, the short, and the diminutive.
Some names decline into all three forms, such as *Thomas/Tom/
Tommy;* sometimes just the formal and short forms exist, as in
*Janet/Jan;* for other names, only the formal and diminutive
exist: *Cynthia/Cindy;* and some names, such as *Lynn*, don't
have the luxury of variants.  These three types are not socially
equivalent.  When a given name is in the long form, it is often
set aside in social use for a less proper version, but it is rare
that someone legally named *Frank* will go around calling
himself *Francis*.  This illustrates that formal names are often the
starting point for shorter forms, but the reverse is not true.

Perhaps this pattern comes from ideas about formality and
social images.  Except for popular art media (where persona is a
calculated commodity), novelists, composers, scholars, etc.
often sign their work with their full legal name to indicate that
they take a professional attitude in these matters, although they
may never use this form among friends.  Shortened forms are
more friendly because they are not as official and often have
fewer syllables, catering to the human tendency to abbreviate.
This may explain the abundance of short forms stemming from
the four-syllable *Elizabeth: Liz, Lizzy, Liza, Eliza, Ellie, Beth,
Betty, Betsy*, etc.  Nonformal names can be divided into
diminutives and nondiminutives, both of which have connotations.
It is often safe to assume that a new acquaintance who
calls himself *Leonard* has a more formal self-image than
someone who prefers to be called *Len* or *Leon*, and also that
*Lenny* will be more playful (or whatever else diminutives
express) than the preceding choices.  This explains why President
Carter was sworn in as Jimmy rather than James,
emphasizing his populist self-image.

An attribute of some names is nonconformity.  To a first-grader
surrounded by *Steves* and *Debbies*, being named *Sylvia*
or *Eunice* can be a curse, because children like to tease others
who stand out in any way.  In contrast, bohemians often
consider common names dull, but uncommon names (especially
those referring to nature) and uncommon spellings are often
viewed as creative and distinct.  Examples include *Fern, Ivy,
Lynda*, and *Nanci*.  Carson McCullers's novel.  *The Member of
the Wedding*, illustrates some of these concepts in the mind of
a teenage girl.  The protagonist is initially a tomboy known as
*Frankie* but, wanting to assert her individuality, switches to *F.
Jasmine*, and finally, when her adult femininity becomes most
important, she switches to *Frances*.

A more specific case of names having meaning is by direct
reference.  Many Hispanics are named *Jesus* (taboo in other
cultures, and irrelevant outside of Christianity) but almost no
one is named *Judas.  Helen* may refer to *Helen of Troy*, which is
quite a compliment, but for a similar reason it would be cruel
to name one's daughter *Jezebel* or *Medusa*, and Jews don't
name their sons *Adolf*.  Personal identities can be expressed by
choices of names, either by parents or the beholder.  Mickey
Mantle wrote, in *The Quality of Courage*, that he was named
after Mickey Cochran, his father's favorite baseball player.  As a
boy Mantle felt he owed it to his father to live up to the image.
In this case the outcome was very favorable, but an uncoordinated
child might have felt he was letting his father down.

Some nicknames such as *Stretch, Red*, and *Groucho* are
direct labels of personal characteristics, the term nickname
coming from an *eke name*, which &ldquo;ekes out&rdquo; the spirit of the
named person.  While usually coined by friends, these usually
stick only when accepted by the nicknamed person.

It is common to name a child after a deceased relative (or
a living one in some religions) to rekindle the spirit of that
ancestor.  This can go unnoticed, but a sensitive child growing
up through role models may feel extra kinship with the source
of his name.  This can be good or bad, inspiring or frustrating,
but in any event, it is in this way that a common name like
*John* can mean &ldquo;Nobel Prize-winning Rhodes scholar&rdquo; or
&ldquo;alcoholic, philandering gambler who deserted his family.&rdquo;  In
either case the child would be aware of the association.

In short, every personal name must suggest something or
be conspicuously nondescript (like *Lee*), which in itself is also
meaningful.

## More Than Just Manitou
*Robert Devereux, Falls Church, Virginia*

In the course of his article &ldquo;Indian File&rdquo; [VII, 4], Norman
Ward makes these interesting statements:

>1)  Few of them (i.e., European settlers in North America)
were interested in native religious beliefs beyond, perhaps,
knowing what should be suppressed.
>
>2)  Native-language words that are specifically associated with
human beings are even rarer in North American English
than those related to animals.
>
>3)  *Manito* stands almost alone as a word of native origin in
the contemporary North American vocabulary which does
not deal with a live or concrete object.

These three statements and the contents of the article as a
whole more or less force the reader to come to the following
conclusions:

>a)  *Manitou* (the preferred spelling according to *Webster's
Third New International Dictionary (NID3); manito* and
*manitu* are recognized variants) and *totem* are the only
Amerind loanwords in English that concern religion.
>
>b)  *Squaw, papoose, cheechako* and *sachem* are the only
Amerind loanwords that denote human beings.
>
>c)  *Manitou, nitchie, potlatch* and *chinook* are the only
Amerind loanwords that do not denote a live or concrete
thing.

Actually, none of these three statements is accurate.  There
are at least several dozen Amerind loanwords that are relevant
to one or more of the three categories.  To be sure, they are not
as widely known as *totem* or *squaw*, and many of them have to
be termed obscure in the extreme; but since they all command
the same separate entry in *NID3*, they clearly have status as
equally good Amerind loanwords in English.

*Religious Terms*

There are, first of all, *chindi*, a Navaho evil spirit of the
dead; *orenda*, an extraordinary invisible power believed by the
Iroquois to pervade in varying degrees all animate and inanimate
natural objects as a transmissible spiritual energy capable
of being exerted according to the will of its possessor; *gahe*,
grotesque masked dancers with yucca crowns representing
mountain spirits in Apache ceremonies; and *kachina* (or *katchina,
katcina, cachina*), one of the deified ancestral spirits
believed among the Hopi and other Pueblo Indians to visit the
pueblos at intervals (as to bring rain).  Next to be mentioned are
the loanwords for various Indian ceremonies, which include:

>*busk* a Creek festival of first fruits and purification that
was celebrated when the first green corn was edible and
that marked the beginning of a new year.
>
>*cantico* a ceremonial dance of the Algonquian Indians of
the Atlantic seaboard.  (The word also denotes any lively
social gathering or dancing party.)
>
>*hako* a Pawnee ceremony representing the union of heaven
and earth and the birth of life, which was performed
with prayers, invocations by pipe, and eagle dancers to
ensure long life and prosperity to the participants.
>
>*huskanaw* an Algonquian initiation rite for youths at
puberty, which included fasting and the use of narcotics.
(*NID3* lists the word both as a noun and a verb.)
>
>*powwow* an Algonquian ceremony (as for cure of disease,
success in hunting, victory in war, etc.) often accompanied
by great noise, feasting and dancing.  The word also
denoted a conjurer or medicine man.  (*NID3* describes the
word as being akin to *pauwau*, a Natick word for conjurer,
as well as meaning a tribal council or conference
with an Indian leader or group, whence its modern
meaning.)
>
>*shalako* a Zu&ntilde;li ceremony which celebrated the advent or
departure of the *kachinas* (see above) and in which
dancers inpersonating a Zu&ntilde;i mythical being of extraordinary
stature played a central role.
>
>*yeibichai* a Navaho initiation or curative ceremony performed
by masked dancers representing a supernatural
being.

Two other obscure but relevant loanwords are *koyemshi*
and *midewiwin* (or *mide, midewin*), which are the names of
Indian societies.  The former was the name of a Zu&ntilde;i clown
society, whose members wore the mask of mudheads and were
credited with curing illness by their dancing and clowning.
(*NID3* defines a mudhead as a member of a Zu&ntilde;i ceremonial
clown society appearing in tribal rites in mud-daubed masks
symbolizing an early stage in the development of man.)
*Midewiwin* was the name of a once-powerful secret society
among the Ojibwa and neighboring tribes which aimed at a
prolongation of life by herbal, magical, and ritual techniques.

Among the Pueblo Indians, ceremonies were likely to be
performed in a *kiva*, a usually round structure, at least partially
underground, with entrance and lighting usually from the roof;
it included a fireplace, altar space, and a *sipapu*.  The last was a
hole in the floor of a *kiva* symbolizing the place where the
mythical tribal ancestors first emerged from the primordial
underworld region into the earthly realm.

Finally, in the realm of religion, there are at least three
loanwords in addition to *totem* that relate to concrete objects
having religious significance: *kisi* 'a bower of interwoven
branches used for keeping snakes before a Hopi snake dance';
*paho* 'a Hopi plumed prayer stick'; and *xat* a carved pole
erected as a memorial to the dead by some Amerind tribes.'

*Terms for Humans*

Some of the loanwords cited above are also valid here.
*Kachina*, for example, also denotes one of the elaborately
masked dancers who impersonate a *kachina* at agricultural
ceremonies, and *yeibichai* and *shalako* similarly have the same
kind of dual usage.  *Koyemshi* denotes a member of the Zu&ntilde;i
society as well as the society itself.  The alternative uses of
*powwow* have already been mentioned.

Perhaps more pertinent for this section are *klootchman* (or
*klootch*) and *mahala*, both of which are essentially synonyms
for *squaw*, the first among tribes of northwestern America (it
derives from Nootka *lotssman* 'woman, wife'), the second
among tribes of California's San Joaquin Valley and adjacent
Sierra Nevada slopes (it derives from Yokuts *mokel* 'woman').
*Sannup*, derived from the Abnaki *senanbe*, is a little known
opposite of *squaw; NID3* defines it as &ldquo;a married male
Amerind.&rdquo;

Aside from *sachem*, there are at least three other Amerind
loanwords denoting a chief, namely, *mico* (Muskogean); *mug-wump*
(Natick), whose political meaning dates only from 1884;
and *sagamore* (Abnaki).

Finally, there is *mohock*, which, by any standards, must be
considered a linguistic curiosity since it is an Amerind loanword
in English that has meaning only in a British, as distinct
from an American context.  A corruption of the tribal name
*Mohawk* (an Algonquian word akin to Narragansett
*mohowauuck* 'they eat animal things'), the word became
current in 1711 (according to the *Oxford Shorter English
Dictionary*) as the name for one of a gang of aristocratic
ruffians who assaulted and otherwise mistreated people in
London in the early 18th century.  Cf. *Apache*.

*Nonconcrete Things*

Color is certainly a nonconcrete object or, if you prefer, an
abstract idea.  There are at least four Amerind loanwords that
denote color.  The first is *persimmon*, an Algonquian word, akin
to Cree *pasiminon* 'dried fruit,' and Delaware *pasimenon*.  The
word is relatively well known as the name of a fruit, but it also
denotes a moderate reddish-orange color that is yellower and
duller than crab-apple or flamingo, or a strong brown that is
redder and deeper than average russet and duller than rust.
The other three color terms are tribal names that have been
pressed into English service as color names:

>*catawba* a very dark to blackish red and, of textiles, a dark
purplish red that is bluer and paler than dahlia purple
and bluer and duller than pansy purple.
>
>*mohawk* a Tuscan brown.  (It might be noted that the
word is also used for a skating maneuver, which is also a
nonconcrete object.)
>
>*navaho* a strong to vivid orange that is redder and darker
than orpiment orange and slightly redder and darker than
Big Four yellow.

Other terms for nonconcrete things relate to a variety of
fields.  In the realm of sports, for example, there is *baggataway*
(or *bagataway*), an Algonquian game from which lacrosse
developed.  *Caucus*, a frequently used word in today's politics,
comes from the Algonquian *caucauasu* 'elder or counselor,' and
the Abnaki *kakesoman*, 'to encourage, arouse.'  Meteorologists
utilize not only *chinook*, already mentioned, but also *pogonip*
(literally 'white death'), a Southern Paiute or Shoshone word
meaning 'a dense white winter fog containing frozen particles'
that is found in deep mountain valleys of the western United
States.  In the realm of medicine, there is *piblokto* (or
*piblockto*), an Eskimo loanword denoting 'a winter-induced
hysteria,' which occurs among women especially.  (Contrary to
the statement made in &ldquo;Indian File,&rdquo; the word *Eskimo* is of
native origin.  Although the English word derives from the
Danish *Eskimo* and the French *Esquimau*, the latter came from
the name applied by the Algonquians to the tribes north of
them, for example, Abnaki *esquimantsic* 'eaters of raw flesh'
and Cree *askimowow* 'he eats it raw.')

A greeting must certainly be considered a nonconcrete
object, and in this area at least two Amerind loanwords are
relevant.  The first is *how*, which is not merely a shortened form
of the standard English amenity &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How do
you do?&rdquo; but a derivation of the Dakota *hao* and/or the
Omaha *hau*.  The second is *netop* 'friend,' often used in
salutation to an Indian by the American colonists.  The word is
Algonquian in origin, akin to the Narragansett *netoup* 'my
friend' and Abnaki *nidanbe*.

*NID3* defines the word *money* as &ldquo;something generally
accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a
means of payment.&rdquo;  In short, money is both a concrete object
and an abstract idea.  In that context, several Amerind loanwords
are relevant.  There is, first of all, *wampum*, a relatively
well-known word, which derives from Narragansett
*wampompeag*, from *wampon* 'white,' *api* 'string,' and *ag*, plural
suffix.  *NID3* has separate entries for *wampumpeag* and *peag*
(variant *peage*).  *NID3* also lists *hawok*, Californian Indian
money consisting of shell disks or buttons, and *roanoke*, from
the Virginian Algonquian *rawran&oacute;ke*, an alternative term for
*wampum*.

Finally, there is *zonta*, from the Siouan *zon'-ta* 'honest,
trustworthy' or, literally, 'he is to be trusted.'  The word has
survived in English, and merits a separate entry in *NID3* as the
name of a women's business and professional service
organization.

The writer makes no claim that the loanwords cited above
are all the relevant ones that exist in the English lexicon.  He
submits, however, that they are sufficient in number to prove
his thesis that Amerind loanwords relating to religion, human
beings, and nonconcrete objects are more numerous than the
average English speaker is aware and that Ward worked from
an insufficient data base.

## Frederick's Formal Family
*Dorena Marshall, Newton, Iowa*

Hi!  (er, I mean HELLO!) My name is Frederick and I
want to introduce you to my Very Formal Family.  We are not
allowed to use nicknames at our house, which seems a little
awkward at times.  My mother's name is Margaret, and no one
has EVER called her Peg or Marge—it just is not done.  My
father's name is James—never Jim or Jimmy.  Oh, and I almost
forgot; there's also my little sister, Elizabeth.

As I walked home from school one evening, I was thinking
about supper, hoping we might have hamburgers.  I even
thought I would surprise Mother (never &ldquo;Mom&rdquo;) by offering to
shape the patricias.  But, as I walked in the back door, I could
smell the simmering vegetables, and knew it was beef stuart.
One of my duties around home is setting the table.  Mother
asked me to put the place matthews around the table, so we
could eat at our usual time, six o'clock on the dorothy.  She said
if we all ate a good supper, she would treat us to some
homemade candace.  Did I eat!

Our family isn't all that richard, but Father announced
after supper that his williamfold was in pretty good shape; and
that we could go somewhere special.  Of course Elizabeth
wanted to go to the beach, but Father said he wasn't too crazy
about the sandra mess there would be in the car afterwards.
Also, Mother remembered the beatrice sting Elizabeth got
there once.

Then I asked if we could go climbing at Cooper's Clifford,
just a few miles outside town.  Mother reminded us of the
charles horse she had after last time.  Father said his archibalds
would never be the same after our last adventure there.

Since no one could agree, we decided to spend a quiet
evening at home.  Mother put on her old terrence robe,
Elizabeth got her theodore bear, and we all played games.  We
all ate our philip of homemade candace and went to bed.

## The Pop Grammarians— Good Intentions, Silly Ideas, and Doublespeak
*Charles Suhor, Deputy Executive Director, National Council of Teachers of English*

The pop grammarians mean well.  All they are asking is that
people stop talking and writing in nonstandard usage,
clich&eacute;s, jargon, and other unworthy language.  Never mind that
they disagree wildly among themselves as to which usages are
nonstandard, what constitutes a clich&eacute;, where legitimate technical
language leaves off and jargon begins.  Never mind that
when they quote scholarly sources at all, their sources disagree
on the very points in dispute.  The pop grammarians mean well
in that they believe that somewhere, out there, there is a best
way to say just about everything, if people would only listen to
reason.

To describe the pop grammarians as naive, to expose their
erroneous historical arguments, to point to their inconsistencies
and flimsy logic is to invite being called a linguistic anarchist.
But, my goodness, they do say some silly things.  John Simon
described the use of *I* in the objective case as a fickle linguistic
innovation, despite the thoroughly respectable history of that
usage, easily found in the *Oxford English Dictionary*, among
other places.  Thomas Middleton denounced the content of
John Mellon's research summary on writing and grammar
because he found the style jargonish; indeed, Middleton suggested
that Mellon leave the profession.  The late Theodore
Bernstein, alone a language scholar among the pop grammarians,
denied that he called nonstandard usages &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
&ldquo;bad,&rdquo; even as he used those very terms in his syndicated
column, &ldquo;Bernstein on Words.&rdquo;  Richard Mitchell claimed a
direct causal relationship between nonstandard usage and the
Three Mile Island accident, reasoning that someone carelessly
schooled in grammar probably would be careless enough to
muck up a nuclear reactor.

Some of this silliness is laid bare in the pages of journals
like *Esquire* and *Saturday Review*.  Other examples were
included in letters from the pop grammarians themselves, in
response to my queries over the years.  Writing letters to pop
grammarians isn't just a matter of intellectual jousting; it is a
way of lowering the ego stakes in discussion of the volatile
issues at hand.  Without a wide public audience to dazzle, a
flamboyant writer will sometimes approach questions with a bit
less swagger.  This was certainly the case with Theodore
Bernstein and Thomas Middleton.  (In fact, Middleton apologized
for his comments about Mellon's work.)  At the very least,
the pop grammarians who respond to well-reasoned letters are
forced to whip up newer and ever more tenuous rationalizations
for their positions.

So far, though, I have been dealing only with good
intentions and silly ideas—neither of which is doublespeak.  By
definition, doublespeak involves &ldquo;deliberate distortion&rdquo;—or in
Bruce Reeves's phrase, &ldquo;active use of language to hide the
truth.&rdquo;  If the pop grammarians were merely earnestly dogmatic
and grossly inaccurate, I would be annoyed but not contemptuous.
I will concentrate on six doublespeak techniques used by
pop grammarians, citing examples along the way.  An element
of deceit or conscious retreat from rational investigation is
embedded in each of the techniques.  They are (1) the overloaded
metaphor; (2) bogus ambiguity; (3) cubing the opposition;
(4) the lucky exception; (5) the unfortunate exception;
and (6) antiscience.

In *the overloaded metaphor*, the pop grammarian uses
analogy—certainly a legitimate rhetorical device—but tries to
invest it with disproportionate argumentative power.  Cleverness,
not a demonstration of the aptness of the analogues, must
carry the argument.  For example, there is some wit in John
Simon's comparison (in *Paradigms Lost*) of nonstandard English
to a life-threatening fever; of a rhododendron, sprouting
flowers in accordance with its nature, to a flawless speaker
spouting nominatives where nominatives belong.  But Simon
fails to show, through historical analysis or logical argument,
that the terms of his metaphors relate to the circumstances he
is trying to characterize.

Richard Mitchell, the Underground Grammarian, actually
invents a bungling primitive tribe called the Jiukiukwe to warn
his readers about the dangers of using the passive voice.  I
hesitate to call this extended metaphor clever, but Mitchell is
clearly having one hell of a good time with it.  Because the
nincompoops in his allegory use the passive voice, they are a
passive people.  They lack technology, sophistication, and common
sense.  So it will be with us, if we continue our wasty,
passive ways instead of putting those agent-subjects up front.

The *bogus ambiguity* technique is the pop grammarians'
way of demonstrating that usages they don't like will create
semantic ambiguity.  In *Strictly Speaking*, Edwin Newman
claims to be baffled by a sentence such as &ldquo;Hopefully, something
will happen.&rdquo;  Who, he wonders, is doing the hoping in
such an utterance?  Will something happen in a hopeful
manner?  Is a puzzlement.  No native speaker can honestly
pretend that such a sentence is ambiguous.  The sentence is as
clear (and structurally as valid) as &ldquo;Certainly, something will
happen,&rdquo; which apparently doesn't bother Newman.  He just
happens to dislike *hopefully* as a sentence modifier, so he cooks
up some ambiguity to justify his position.  When I debated John
Simon at Tulane University in 1981, he invented an absurd
sentence in which failure to observe the standard forms of *lie*
and *lay* supposedly lay to an obscene interpretation: &ldquo;Last
Sunday I laid in bed for several hours.&rdquo;  I sometimes think
Simon receives sentences one at a time from random sources,
or finds them tucked individually in envelopes on his doorstep.
In any real communication setting, the context would clearly
reveal, even to Simon, whether the *laid* of his sentence meant
*rested* or *screwed*.

The question of clarity in human interaction is an important
one, so the pop grammarians are wise to try to link
essentially irrelevant questions of usage to problems of ambiguity.
But their methods of doing do are fraudulent.  Garbled
syntax is confusing; so is poor development of ideas in a
conversation or essay; so are pronunciations from unfamiliar
dialects, at least until one's ear grows attuned.  But only in the
world of textbook examples and pop grammarians' analyses do
we find rampant cognitive confusion over &ldquo;misuse&rdquo; of words
like *hopefully, lie*, and *lay*.

In *cubing the opposition*, one makes a point; the pop
grammarian ridicules it by raising it to the third power.  Cubing
involves adding amusing features to the opposing argument,
features that were not there in the first place, to achieve a
humorous distortion.  Theodore Bernstein was one of the first to
cube the legitimate feminist arguments against sexism in
language.  In a 1976 &ldquo;Bernstein on Words&rdquo; column, he evoked
images of a chaotic world in which, among other things, Ann
Speakman would technically have to change her name to &ldquo;Ann
Speakperson.&rdquo;  I have since heard other examples of the
*manhole/personhole, woman/woperson* variety—but always
from people who don't like to pursue problems of sexist
language beyond jocular attempts at cubing the opposition.

At the Tulane debate John Simon, I praised a third-grade
student's stunning image—&ldquo;Flowers feel like rain&rdquo;—as a creative
response to a bland writing assignment, and I criticized
her teacher's niggling red-pencil tactics.  Simon cubed the point
by saying that the child's metaphor should not prompt us to
&ldquo;proclaim her the new Marianne Moore&rdquo; and &ldquo;fall at her feet
in adoration.&rdquo;  I have to admit that his comment was amusing,
but the idea of declaring the child a genius was his, not mine.
By exaggerating my modest claim in an erudite way, Simon
avoided addressing the issues I had raised—*viz*., children's
capacity for creating metaphor and the effects of empty
formalistic feedback.

The *lucky exception* is the pop grammarian's way of
dealing with evidence that speakers designated as &ldquo;unskilled&rdquo;
can actually express themselves with clarity and invention.  If a
third grader creates an interesting figure of speech, John Simon
calls it dumb luck.  If nonstandard dialect speakers come up
with good metaphors or unusual turns of phrase, if they
advance ideas cogently in their own dialects, the pop grammarians
explain these events as isolated incidents or charming
flukes.  For them, nonstandard English is *ipso facto* unsuited to
the expression of complex ideas and sensibilities.  There is no
empirical basis for the lucky exception claim, and it is clear
that John Simon and Edwin Newman do not spend a great deal
of time sampling the nonstandard language of, say, jazz
musicians or ghetto youth.  But Simon *does* have an overloaded
metaphor to explain lucky exceptions.  A clumsy dancer, he
says, will in the course of inept fumbling sometimes stumble
luckily over a new step.  This is different from the experienced
dancer who, working from a deep understanding of the art,
acts consciously to expand its horizons.

The metaphor is interesting, but its terms are not referential
to their analogues, i.e., the way people make language in
the real world.  Teachers and researchers have long known that
many students from nonstandard dialect communities are
capable of thoughtful, powerful expression in their native
dialects and that command of standard usage in no way
guarantees clear or imaginative use of language.  Edwin Newman
treats lucky exceptions with patronizing good humor.  In
*Strictly Speaking* he is tickled, really, over colorful expressions
uttered by a union leader, a cab driver, Harry Truman, a
gardener, and other no-class types.  Their deviant language—
sometimes errors, sometimes highly memorable personal statements—is
in the world for Newman's entertainment and
smarmy commentary.  When a bozo talks to Newman about
teachers and says &ldquo;Them is my chief dread,&rdquo; Newman
remarks, &ldquo;There is no way to improve on that.&rdquo;

The *unfortunate exception* is alter ego to the lucky
exception.  In *Paradigms Lost*, John Simon speaks of &ldquo;the giants
of the English tongue who preceded us, all of those great
writers and speakers who were ... in the ballgame that
counts.&rdquo;  (The ballgame metaphor refers to a comment earlier
in his essay.)  When someone points out to Simon that these
giants used virtually every nonstandard form that the pop
grammarians consider to be destructive of civilized communication,
Simon talks about &ldquo;slips&rdquo; and &ldquo;lapses,&rdquo; atypical events
that can be dismissed as if they had never occurred.  In a
different context, I once tested the unfortunate exception idea.
After noticing that several well-known essayists used clich&eacute;s
now and then, I decided to find out whether or not these
apparent slipups were truly unusual.  So I proceeded to analyze
some of my favorite prose stylists disrespectfully, i.e., as if they
had punched me in the face the night before.  My clich&eacute; hunt
revealed that E. B. White's essays were well laced with phrases
like &ldquo;when I first laid eyes on it&rdquo; and &ldquo;a tremendous shot in
the arm.&rdquo;  I found that William Buckley used clich&eacute;s like
&ldquo;passing along the torch,&rdquo; &ldquo;an air of finality,&rdquo; and &ldquo;we look
forward to the experience.&rdquo;  Tom Wolfe saw things &ldquo;as clear as
day,&rdquo; was &ldquo;profoundly moved,&rdquo; and was willing to &ldquo;stand up
and be counted.&rdquo;  It would seem, then, that respected writers
from both the past and present use language far more playfully
and freely than we normally admit.  Excellent writers apparently
are confident enough to use nonstandard forms and
commonplaces when doing so works well within the overall
texture of a work.

Pop grammarians, being committed to the notion of
perfect expression, often feel obliged to indulge in public
breast-beating when &ldquo;unfortunate exceptions&rdquo; show up in their
own speech.  In a gathering of language purists on *The Dick
Cavett Show*, Simon, Agnes de Mille, and Edwin Newman
were reduced to continuous self-correction as they became
increasingly analytical about each sentence they uttered.
Instead of exchanging ideas about language in a fluent way, the
pop grammarians were gagging on their own obsessions with
perfection, unable to admit that the inevitable unfortunate
exception is a function of the dynamic qualities of human
expression, not an effect of Original Sin.

*Anti-Science* is a recurring theme in John Simon's writing
and speech.  Sometimes the theme is expressed subtly, as in his
*Paradigms Lost* swipe at the lengthy scholarly bibliography
appended to CCCC's *Student's Right to their Own Language*.
At Tulane he declared that language is an art, not a science.  He
was consistent in this.  His talk was artful, but he made scant
reference to scholarship.  He expressed a fond hope that
research like William Labov's studies of dialects would be
discountinued.  He pooh-poohed the idea that useful bibliographies
of language research exist.  It has often been said that you
can prove anything by citing research.  Simon's counter-principle
appears to be that you can prove anything as long as you
ignore research.  Richard Mitchell's contempt for scholarship is
revealed in dozens of ways.  He shows slim understanding of
the purposes, history, and procedures of holistic and primary
trait test scoring, even as he condemns them.  His program for
teaching young children to write, described in *Instructor*
magazine, flies in the face of virtually all research.  (&ldquo;First,
children must learn all the conventions of writing: punctuation,
capitalization, spelling....&rdquo;)  To him, intellectual rigor is a
matter of enforcing the purist view of language and closing
one's eyes to linguistic scholarship and the uses of language in
the real world.

It is ironic that the pop grammarians, who claim to be
champions of high standards in language, often operate as
saboteurs, subverting the communicative functions of language
with trashy argumentation—sly irrelevancies, curmudgeonly
posturing, and outright grandstanding.  Joseph Epstein put the
situation in perspective when he said that people like John
Simon give standards a bad name.  He recommended, moreover,
that the language purists stop quibbling over minutiae
and turn their guns on the real enemy—namely, &ldquo;deception in
its various forms, deliberate, unconscious, and self-.  With ...
the wondrous cant from politics and psychology and education,
we have all the means at hand to be lied to or to lie
convincingly to ourselves.&rdquo;  In other words, they should be
joining in the war against doublespeak.


#### EPISTOLA {Norman R. Shapiro}

Philip Howard's allusion to the many suggested (and
discredited) origins of *O.K.* [IX, 3] has jogged me into lobbing
yet another hat into the etymological ring.  To wit, the Scottish
expression *och aye*, 'aye yes.'  With its guttural &ldquo;ch,&rdquo; unnatural
to American uvulas, this common phrase would easily have
reduced to *O.K*.  It certainly wouldn't be the lone Scotticism in
the early American lexicon.

I can't even come close to &ldquo;proving&rdquo; this etymology, but it
seems so logical and reasonable that I can't believe I've never
seen or heard it put forward.  I think it is, at least, a worthy
challenger to the rather fanciful &ldquo;orl korrect&rdquo; (which, by the
way, I originally saw ascribed to Andrew Jackson's alleged
semi-literacy).  On semantic grounds, it would imply that the
expression began as a general affirmative exclamation (e.g., &ldquo;Be
off with you!&rdquo;  &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo;) before becoming adjectival (e.g., &ldquo;These
plans are O.K.&rdquo;).  But the reverse can't be proven, even if the
earliest written evidence were to suggest it.

Orl things konsidered, I think *och aye* is a kwalified
kontender.

## An Architectonic of Verbs
*Charles M. Young, Claremont Graduate School*

In many natural languages, verbs can be determined along
as many as six distinct dimensions: *mood, number, aspect,
person, voice*, and *time*.  It happens that there is an attractive
logic to this congeries of features.  The six dimensions themselves
are, I take it, familiar.  A verb's mood may be indicative
(as it is, for example, in &ldquo;Brutus is stabbing Caesar&rdquo;), subjunctive
(&ldquo;If Brutus were stabbing Caesar ...&rdquo;), optative (&ldquo;Would
that Brutus stabbed Caesar!&rdquo;), or imperative (&ldquo;Brutus, stab
Caesar&rdquo;) in mood.  Its number may be singular (&ldquo;Brutus is
stabbing Caesar,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am stabbing Caesar&rdquo;) or plural (&ldquo;You
conspirators are stabbing Caesar&rdquo;); some languages have
optional dual forms for use when the subject of the sentence is
a pair of items.  In aspect, verbs can be simple (&ldquo;aorist&rdquo;)
(&ldquo;Brutus stabbed Caesar&rdquo;), progressive (&ldquo;Brutus was stabbing
Caesar&rdquo;), or perfect (&ldquo;Brutus has stabbed Caesar&rdquo;).  They may
occur in the first person (&ldquo;I stabbed Caesar&rdquo;), the second
person (&ldquo;You stabbed Caesar&rdquo;), or the third person (&ldquo;Brutus
stabbed Caesar&rdquo;).  A verb can be active (&ldquo;Brutus stabbed
Caesar&rdquo;) or passive (&ldquo;Caesar was stabbed by Brutus&rdquo;) in voice;
some languages have, in addition, special middle forms.  Finally,
the time of a verb may be past (&ldquo;Brutus stabbed Caesar&rdquo;),
present (&ldquo;Brutus stabs Caesar&rdquo;), or future (&ldquo;Brutus will stab
Caesar&rdquo;).

It is less well known that these six dimensions are primary,
in that other features of verbs can be defined in terms of them.
A *tense*, for example, is specified by two determinations, one as
to time and another as to aspect.  The present perfect tense
(&ldquo;Brutus has killed Caesar&rdquo;) is present in time and perfective in
aspect; the past tense (&ldquo;Brutus killed Caesar&rdquo;) is past in time
and simple in aspect; and so on.  An *intransitive* verb (&ldquo;Caesar
died&rdquo;) is one with no passive determination as to voice, while a
*linking* verb (&ldquo;Caesar was ambitious&rdquo;), is said to be &ldquo;voiceless,&rdquo;
i.e., undetermined as to voice.

The order in this array of dimensions is seen most clearly
in the basic sentence, which consists in a *speech act* regarding
some *subject's* involvement in some *action*.  If for example
Brutus says to the crowd, &ldquo;Caesar has been killed,&rdquo; Caesar is
the subject of his sentence, the killing of Caesar is the action,
and his saying that Caesar has been killed is the speech act.  In
such a sentence, the first three determinations—those as to
mood, number, and aspect—give information about one of
these three components.  *Mood* defines the *speech act*, indicating
whether it is meant as an assertion, as contrary to fact, as a
wish, as an order, or whatever.  *Number* quantifies the *subject*,
as one or more than one.  And *aspect* specifies a perspective
taken on the *action*, the verb being simple, progressive, or
perfective in aspect, depending on whether the action is seen
as a simple occurrence, as ongoing, or as completed.

Person, voice, and time also give information about speech
act, subject, and action, but this time taken in pairs.  *Person*
reflects a connection between *speech act* and *subject*.  The verb
is in the first person if the subject is the author of the speech
act; in the second person if the subject is the recipient of the
speech act; and in the third person, if the subject is some third
party.  *Voice* reveals a relation of *subject* to *action*: the verb is
active or passive, respectively, if the subject of the sentence is
the agent (patient) of the action.  *Time*, finally, dates *action*
relative to *speech act*: the verb is past, present, or future
according as the action is prior to, contemporaneous with, or
subsequent to the speech act.

Figure 1, which connects each of the six dimensions to the
component or pair of components of the basic sentence that it
concerns, helps to make the underlying structure clear:

![Figure 1](/content/back-issues/fig1.png)

As the figure indicates, mood, number, and aspect define
speech act, subject, and action in themselves, while person,
voice, and time define one of the three possible relations among
them.

A few remarks on certain anomalous or otherwise interesting
cases are in order.  First, in languages in which the
progressive aspect can be expressed without auxiliaries, the use
of a progressive tense is (syntactically) ambiguous as to whether
it is an *action*, or a *practice*, or an *activity*, which is represented
as ongoing.  In English, these ambiguities are generally
resolved, typically through the use of auxiliaries.  Thus &ldquo;Brutus
is stabbing Caesar&rdquo; and &ldquo;Brutus was stabbing Caesar&rdquo; depict
an action as ongoing, while &ldquo;Brutus used to stab Caesar&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;habitual&rdquo; reading of &ldquo;Brutus stabs Caesar&rdquo; concern a
practice.  &ldquo;To keep (on)&rdquo; can be used as an auxiliary indicating
the progressive aspect, but whether the verb in such a construction
concerns an action or a practice turns on the number
of its object.  &ldquo;Brutus kept on stabbing Caesar,&rdquo; for example, is
about an action, while &ldquo;Brutus kept on stabbing people&rdquo; is
about a practice.  A second point concerns stage directions, like
&ldquo;They stab Caesar.&rdquo;  To a cast, of course, stage directions
function as if they were imperatives, but their real mood is
indicative.  This is true even of &ldquo;Exit,&rdquo; which is a Latin
indicative, not an English imperative.  And, like other remarks
about what happens in plays, stage directions count as simple
or progressive in aspect, depending on whether a play is seen
as a single production or as a sequence of productions.  Finally,
the mood of certain verbs is often difficult to determine.
Whether &ldquo;Drop dead&rdquo; expresses an order or a wish, for
example, depends upon the spirit in which it is uttered.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: [*Anathema!  Medieval Scribes and the History of Book Curses*](https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/anathema-medieval-scribes-history-book/author/marc-drogin/)
Marc Drogin, (Allanheld &amp; Schram, 1983), xx + 138 pp.

When rebellious Abbie Hoffman published *Steal This
Book!*, in 1971, he was cursed by bookstore owners everywhere.
Placing an anathema—in earlier times the curse of excommunication
and death, not just a vehement curse—upon those who
damage or steal books can be traced back at least 28 centuries.
The oldest known book curse in Drogin's charming work was
inscribed on a Babylonian clay tablet of the 7th century B.C.
The temple curse is even older.  Temples housed the library;
thus, a curse designed to protect the temple and its contents
may be the oldest curse of this genre.  We have an example
from 3800 B.C., engraved on the door socket of the temple of
Ba'al by King Sargon I.

Book curses are just one kind of many ecclesiastic, royal,
and legal damnations upon anyone who would try to rob coffins
(*May you be without seed!*) or disobey legal decrees (*May a
donkey copulate with you and your wife!*).  Marc Drogin
presents a beautiful, illustrated history of book curses ranging
from formal Babylonian damnations to an informal 20th-century
reaction to an anathema.

Approximately half of the book treats related matters: the
life, craft, and toils of medieval scribes, how books were
written and cared for, and the value of medieval books, all
leading up to the book curses meant to protect the results of a
scribe's labors.  A glossary of medieval and ecclesiastic book
terms, from *accentuarius* to *weax-bred*, as well as a list of
sources, complete this volume.  The design, layout, and illustrations
are tasteful.  Many book-related quotations and nearly 90
book curses, often in other tongues, with English translations,
are woven into the essays and commentary.

Mr. Drogin's interests are divided between the world of
the medieval scribe—born 1000 years behind his time, he works
as a medieval calligrapher and illuminator—and the book curse
proper.  This may explain why he missed Lawrence Thompson's
&ldquo;Bibliological Maledictions Revisited&rdquo; in *Maledicta* (1978),
featuring a dozen multilingual book curses that would have
rounded out this introduction with such unusual macaronic
curses as ... *in ventrem illius I'll stick my scalpellum / And
teach him to steal my little libellum*, or William Barnes's four-line
curse in Italian, Latin, French, and English.  Thompson
also shows the decline of afterwordly punishments by citing the
contemporary *Do not steal this book of knowledge / Or you'll
be sent to Sing-Sing College*.

As long as manuscripts and books have been around, they
have been stolen.  Thompson tells us that in the 19th century
G. Libri, as inspector of libraries in France, stole hundreds of
priceless manuscripts.  In September 1983, Cees Post reported
in the Dutch *NRC Handelsblad* that the remaining copies of
*Maledicta*, at the University of Utrecht are watched especially
carefully because they are &ldquo;a desirable booty among the
*kleptomane bibliofielen*.&rdquo;  College and public libraries, who lose
tens of thousands of dollars' worth of books every year, know
that callous modern patrons can't be scared with eternal
damnation and thus are forced to install expensive electronic
devices with locking gates and sirens to deter book thefts.

Our callousness toward curses is best illustrated by Marc
Drogin's experience: Professor Harvey, a classics scholar at the
University of Exeter, England, sent him an envelope with
precious references upon which he had inscribed *PLEASE DO
NOT BEND.  If anyone shall bend this, let him lie under perpetual
malediction.  Fiat.  Fiat.  Fiat.  Amen*.  The envelope arrived bent,
with a British postal worker's printed reaction to the anathema:
*Fart*.

Book curses often are short poems (*Christ's curse upon the
crook / Who takes away this book*); others range from single
lines (*Whoever steals this book, may there be anathema upon
him*) to a dozen lines telling us to whom the book belongs, its
contents, and what will happen to the book thief.  The scribes
scared potential book thieves with all sorts of threats: They will
be erased from the Book of Life; suffer violent bodily pains;
receive a blow upon their fundaments; be hit with a rod,
mightily; hang from gallows; get a knife into their bellies; be
drowned; be cleft by the sword of a demon; have their eyes
gouged or picked out by ravens; be consigned to the depths of
hell; endure fire and brimstone; have their souls rot away; be
boiled in a cauldron, seized by epilepsy and fever, and broken
on the wheel; be tied by the chain of excommunication; be
accursed unto their seventh generation; or be ripped apart by
swine.

Today's mild-mannered librarians threaten us with a bloodcurdling
fine of 5 cents a day.  I wonder whether a large
anathema above our libraries' exits, such as IF YOU STEAL A
BOOK, MAY YOUR HEART BE RIPPED APART BY SWINE!, would
not be as effective as a $40,000 electronic gate....

The publishers, a division of Littlefield, Adams &amp; Co.,
apparently are not yet owned by an oil company with shifty-eyed
executives watching the bottom line.  How else would a
commercial press dare publish such a lovely work, the kind of
treat for one's mind and soul nowadays produced only by
university or private presses?  This book should be required
reading for all medievalists, librarians, and book-lovers.  Libraries
ought to forgo one trendy title and instead acquire this book
of lasting value.  Anathema upon them if they don't!

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: [*A Mania for Sentences*](https://www.amazon.com/Mania-Sentences-D-J-Enright/dp/0701126620)
D.J. Enright, (Chatto &amp; Windus, the Hogarth Press, 1983), 211 pp.

What is criticism for?  The British are generally anti-intellectual
and suspicious of the higher criticism that claims to
be a science or tries to pursue some autonomous business of its
own.  They go in for it less than the Americans, the Germans,
or the French.  They tend to dislike literary theory, and prefer a
good read.

Enright is a poet, a fully paid-up member of the intellectuals'
club, and that chimera, a serious British literary critic.  His
book consists of essays that began life as reviews of new books,
and he sees himself as a practical critic: that is, somebody
whose criticism, when it comes off, is of practical use to readers
by describing, drawing out, comparing, concurring, or quarreling
with the work it is discussing.  The practical critic, the book
reviewer, may be a hand-maiden or a cup bearer, but he or she
serves in a family of gods.  Or sometimes of demons.  And more
often of clowns and cranks, from all of whom something may
be learnt.

Do not be deceived by his depreciation of literary theory.
His principles and views of literature protrude through the
prose without being formally stated.  He is a witty and
immensely well-read man.  With British diffidence Enright may
shrink from the label; but he is one of our splendid and rare
masters of the higher criticism.

That is why a collection of his old reviews, revised and
expanded, is worth publishing as a book.  How many other book
reviewers can we say that about?  Lionel Trilling and Bernard
Shaw, yes.  But there are not many critics writing today whose
pieces are worth reproducing between hard covers.  Anthony
Burgess, yes, but for the liveliness of the writing and the
extravagance of the ideas rather than for the coherence of the
literary theory.  Enright is worth preserving because there is
hardly anybody else writing in Britain who surveys the literature
of the world from *The Tale of Genji* to Max Frisch, takes a
characteristically urbane British view of it, and remains a
pleasure to read.  Even the higher criticism ought to be more
accessible, at any rate not (as it often is) less accessible, than
what it is commenting on.

The essays relate both to particular books and to language
as it appears (and disappears) in writing and speech.  The
writers and the linguistic phenomena selected for discussion are
chameleonic.  The writers because they evade fixed identity and
contrive, as Keats expressed it, to &ldquo;live in gusto, be it foul or
fair, rich or poor, mean or elevated.&rdquo;  The linguistic features are
chameleons because they change color according to their
surroundings or have their color changed forcibly by those who
use or abuse them.

The first section of the book deals with German writers,
who are more admired than read by the British intelligentsia.
They include Mann, Musil, Brecht, Max Frisch, Grass, and
B&ouml;ll.  Enright is an exception to the British resistance to
German literary classics.  He knows them as old friends and in
his essays discusses such tricky literary questions as fantasy (is
it real?) and modern biography (history or fiction?).  Next comes
a group of essays on Eastern and other European works, chiefly
novels, which, through the intercession of the excellent translators
they have attracted, can claim to be classics of world
literature.

The final section is more specifically linguistic in theme.  It
is concerned with &ldquo;sexistolinguistics&rdquo; or the His and Hers of
words, clich&eacute;s and the philosophical and social significance
imputed to them, the cleansing of dirty words and the dirtying
of clean ones, and the use of language by children in self-expression
and self-protection.  The boy asked by his teacher to
use a familiar word in a new way came up with: &ldquo;The boy
returned home with a clich&eacute; on his face.&rdquo;  When asked to
explain himself, he answered: &ldquo;The dictionary defines clich&eacute; as
'a worn-out expression.' &rdquo;

The book ends with concise appraisals of several writers,
including Anthony Burgess, E. B. White, and Raymond
Queneau, who are more than usually involved in serious games
with language.

Here is Enright in typical form: &ldquo;*Maledicta* calls itself
'The International Journal of Verbal Aggression,' but the worst
thing about it is its editorial huffing and puffing.  It sees itself as
a band of frank, gallant and daring intellects battling vigorously
against the 'envious, mindless, cacademoid prissy pricks' of
some putative stuffed-shirt Establishment.  In truth *Maledicta*
(the best thing about it is its name) is the old Teutonic
philologizing shakily transferred to the dark side of the tongue:
the sort of volte-face so popular when once safe.&rdquo;

Enright is a journalist and an intellectual.  His tone is a
characteristic fusion of light-heartedness and gravity.  The best
literature, he believes, entertains, astonishes, and strengthens,
but also rebukes, warns, and sometimes terrifies.  It is the sort of
book that might give literature a good name among the British.
And that would never do.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: [*The Language of the Teenage Revolution*](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780333294000/Language-Teenage-Revolution-Hudson-E-0333294009/plp)
Kenneth Hudson, (Macmillan, 1983), 137 pp.  

Kenneth Hudson's thesis is that since the last war, rising
to a climax in the sixties, there has been a social revolution in
the United Kingdom, which has produced a self-conscious and
aggressive teenage culture.  British society has stopped being a
pyramid, with the elders and betters at the top, and become
more like a pear, a pear tending to become an apple.  Englishmen,
perhaps even more Englishwomen, stopped looking
upwards as they had in the past; outward looking began to
replace upward looking.  For the first time in history the young
had enough money to live their own lives and set their own
style.  This instant pop culture differs radically from the life
styles of the parents and ancestors of the new people, and it
expresses itself in a hermetic jargon, which is a badge of
revolution as surely as the jeans and the hair-styles.  At some
time around the sixties young Brit males leaving school started
to say: &ldquo;I don't need to wear a tie; I don't have to cut my hair
short; and I can make up my spelling and grammar to suit
myself and my contemporaries.  We are not going to be bound
by the conventions of the past in the way we dress, or the way
we talk, or the way we live.&rdquo;

Because it is largely a spoken culture rather than a written
one, this linguistic revolution, according to Hudson, has eluded
the conventional lexicographers, who are not equipped to deal
with the spoken word.  With courage above and beyond the call
of duty, Hudson has gone hunting for this language of the
teenage revolution in magazines such as *Rolling Stone, New
Musical Express, My Guy, and Honey*.  He has come back with
much interesting matter of detail about the tone and register of
the language of the British young, working class and black, and
in particular with a theory that the new young speak with
irony, between quotation marks, giving a quite new flavor to
old words.

What are we to say to all this?

First perhaps that it is a common old delusion that the
world is going to the dogs, that the changes in style and
language that have happened since one was taught English
oneself are more radical than anything that has happened
before.  The language of the teenage revolution is a recurring
phenomenon.  You have only to read Vanbrugh and Sheridan to
hear the middle-aged complaining about what the young dogs
and fops were doing to the King's English, and indeed to their
hair-styles and clothes.

Second, I think Hudson exaggerates the difficulty that
lexicographers have with the spoken word.  It is not a matter
that is susceptible to proof one way or another, but I think that
new words and meanings in English are written down somewhere,
probably in *Rolling Stone*, almost as soon as they come
into the language.  Using their old-fashioned written sources,
the lexicographers of the *Oxford English Dictionary* have
traced *cunt* back much earlier than Hudson supposes, to a
street called *Gropecuntlane* in the City of London circa 1230;
Dunbar used *fuck* in a poem in 1503, without any noticeable
hesitation or timidity.  They were going through another brave
new revolution against the fuddy-duddy establishment at the
time.  The lexicographers of the *Collins English Dictionary*,
using the old-fashioned methods, seem to me to have got *kinky*
dead right as long ago as 1979.  Hudson says that in the sixties
*kinky* implied deviation, with a strong hint of sadism: a *kinky*
person was a deviant or pervert of some kind.  Soon after this
the whole business of whips, high boots, and leather clothing
began to appear laughable, rather than sinister, to those
people—the great majority—whose own tastes did not incline in
that direction, and it is now close to being a joke word among
the young.  *Collins* makes all these points, somewhat more
economically.  So does Volume II, H-N, of the *OED Supplement*,
with a wealth of exemplary citations from a wide variety
of written sources.

Third, the habit of talking in quotation marks is by no
means as new as Kenneth Hudson supposes.  The young have
always used irony and intonation and accent to send up the
grown-up language they are inheriting, and to send coded
messages to their peer-group.  There may be more of it around
today than in the conformist generations between the wars,
when grammar was still taught in schools and you could get a
hot dinner with wine for half a crown... yawn, yawn.  But
these things go in cycles.  And teenagers have always, even in
the most conformist generations, been prolific and inventive
sources of slang.  I think that the Bright Young Things of the
twenties spoke a language of shibboleths and ironic accent and
quotation marks quite as much as today's teenagers.

Kenneth Hudson has made an intrepid foray into the
jungle of teenage slang.  It is not as novel or unexplored a jungle
as he imagines.  But he has brought back some interesting
samples.  It is a pity that the explorer disapproved so strongly of
the jungle he was exploring and had so little taste, for example,
for pop music that he can dismiss its lyrics as almost always
gibberish.  But his book is a useful little contribution to
understanding the way that some of us speak now.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: [*A Treasury for Word Lovers*](https://www.abebooks.com/Treasury-Word-Lovers-Professional-writing-series/30947355634/bd)
Morton S. Freeman, (ISI Press, 1983), x + 333pp.

Edwin Newman's &ldquo;Foreword&rdquo; consists of a page of listings
of slips in grammar, style, and spelling that he doesn't like,
with a one-sentence blurb at the end.

Morton S. Freeman's book consists of an alphabetical
listing of the usual sort of thing one finds in a usage book,
though he goes somewhat further than most in providing
synonym distinctions and cogent comments on usage.  Why he
has seen fit to add cutesy and obvious clich&eacute;s to the entries is
beyond me—BROAD, WIDE: *Take a Wide Berth*; BURGLAR,
ROBBER, THIEF; *Who Steals My Purse*...; BOURGEOIS, PROLETARIAT:
*One Burgher to Go*, etc.  But there they are.

Freeman is former Director of Publications, American
Law Institute—American Bar Association (almost *ALI BABA*),
and his remarks are generally tempered by a sober judiciousness.
His style is didactic and tends toward the peremptory,
and he makes good sense; but occasionally his coverage of a
topic is sparse (FOREIGN WORDS, where rules for italicization
are virtually ignored), or nonexistent (the split infinitive is not
discussed at all), or unnecessary (Do people really confuse
*shortfall* with *windfall*?), or improperly described (&ldquo;As a verbal
modifier following a verb, either *wrong* or *wrongly* is permissible,
though *wrong* is preferred.&rdquo;)

This last comment characterizes the nature of the
approach: when linguists use the word *preferred*, they mean
'more frequently found in the language of educated native
speakers'; they do not contrast it with &ldquo;permissible,&rdquo; which is
more like the approach Newman, Simon, and others might
take.  Permissible to whom?  Surely not to linguists or other
language professionals or to society.  Otherwise, Freeman's
advice seems rather bland.  If you collect such books, you might
find some justification in adding this one to your stock; as a
guide, there are others that are more interestingly written,
more authoritative, and more thorough in their treatment of
those bothersome ambiguities and unresolved questions of style
that, sooner or later, nettle us all.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: [*Native Tongues*](https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/native-tongues/author/charles-berlitz/first-edition/)
Charles Berlitz, (Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1982), xi + 340 pp.

&ldquo;A unique storehouse,&rdquo; gasps the blurb, &ldquo;of surprising,
thought-provoking, fascinating, and useful facts about the
human speech and the written word.&rdquo;  Translation: a stale
potpourri of exotic tidbits and snippets, whose accuracy needs
continual checking against references the author does not
provide.  Experts may merely be irritated; layfolk, for whom
this exercise in multilingual *Schlamperei* is meant, will trust the
Book-of-the-Month Club selectors and the Berlitz name (though
the author disclaims connection with the schools) and be
deceived.

Take the one Berlitz idea that is new and could really be
helpful: a &ldquo;rock-bottom basic 8-word vocabulary&rdquo; (p. 224) for
survival in 15 European and 10 Asian languages plus Swahili.
Learn to say *excuse me, please, thanks, where is?, how much
is?, yes, no*, and *good*, and your foot is in the door; many a
phrase book shows less sense.  But in Japanese, the word given
for 'excuse me' is *moshi-moshi*, which is used almost exclusively
for 'hello' on the phone.  (To attract attention, try *shitsurei desu
ga* or *anone*; to apologize, *gomen nasai* or *sumimasen*—a
distinction Mr. Berlitz's list ignores.)  And if the author can
butterfinger one out of eight in Japanese, what is his average
likely to be for Thai, Hindustani, Turkish, or Polish?

Indeed, of 36 pages indexed under &ldquo;Japanese,&rdquo; at least 15
contain errors—up to 7 per page; and though some may be
misprints, that is no help when the non-polyglot reader can't
catch them.  Mispronunciation abound, including an attempted
latrine-wall pun on *fuku* (really pronounced rather like English
&ldquo;hook&rdquo;).  Still in Asia (to excerpt and spitlist running four pages
single-spaced) the author confuses alphabets with syllabaries
(115-117), misnames days of the week (105), misinterprets the
Chinese for *revolution* (260), and mis-romanizes Generalissimo
Chiang's name in *pinyin* (262); heading West, he ends Stalin's
Christian name with a &ldquo;p&rdquo; (215), leaves the ICHTHYS acronym
incomplete (250), and thinks Yiddish *schwanz* means simply
and purely &ldquo;tail&rdquo; (179); at home, he derives Reno, Nevada,
from the Spanish for—believe it or not—'reindeer' (166).  So
much for common sense and standard sources!

Outside languages as such, Mr. Berlitz sometimes displays
mere ignorance, as when missing the point of &ldquo;owls to Athens&rdquo;
(205) or characterizing the egregious Frederick the Great as a
ladies' man (249); more often he adopt Von D&auml;niken's Method
(if it makes good copy, print it and let documentation wait),
resurrecting such pinchbeck oldies as the myth that &ldquo;German
almost became the official language of the United States&rdquo; (43)
or the pedantic misdiagnosis of Cindrella's slipper as &ldquo;really
fur&rdquo; (239).  Then there's the chapter entitled &ldquo;There Were
Others Before Columbus,&rdquo; which ransacks Amerind languages
from Patagonia to Puget Sound for verbal similarities &ldquo;proving&rdquo;
visits here by everybody from Japanese through Sumerians to
Berbers.  In previous works, Mr. Berlitz has employed such
arguments *ad ignorantiam* and *ad captandum* to promote belief
in a lost antediluvian civilization centered on Atlantis; and his
methodology is worthy of his thesis.  As my 14-year-old points
out, there are only so many sounds available; given wide
enough vocabularies, you can prove relationships between and
languages you like.

Previous works by Mr. Berlitz fall into two groups: here,
such straight pedagogy as *Spanish Step by Step*; there, such
flights of fancy—really a single flight, continually, buoyed up by
new hot air—as *Doomsday 1999 A.D., Mysteries From Forgotten
Worlds*, and *The Mystery of Altantis*.  The latter list is the place
for *Native Tongues*.

## Antipodean English: *A Pet Avoision*
*G.W. Turner*

I have just returned from Canberra and the first &ldquo;National
Word Festival,&rdquo; a weekend gathering of writers and those
interested in words.  A well-known poet, Judith Wright, hearing
of the National Word Festival, asked &ldquo;What is the national
word?&rdquo;  Since it had already been decided to run a competition
as part of the festivities, it was clear what the competition
should be: Find the national word.

What would you answer if asked for the national word in
the USA or Britain?  In Australia plenty of words suggest
themselves, to be quickly rejected usually.  There's *bloody* of
course, long known as *the great Australian adjective*, a necessary
device in a male-dominated society for giving emphasis
without raising the voice in a feminine way.  But it has faded
with use and any emphasis it gives now is pretty bloody faint
(and you'll notice it is not only an adjective).  *Kangaroo* is too
obvious; *ornithorhyncus* too remote.  *Transcontibloodynental* is
too long, *emu* a bit short.  All are obsessed with the outback and
flora and fauna.

In fact most Australians never see the outback; they live in
cities dividing their time between working and voting in
elections.  There are lower and upper chambers in the parliaments
of all states except Queensland, and there's a Federal
Government as well.  In theory parliaments run for three years;
in fact there are frequent early elections or snap elections as
parties strive for electoral advantage or try to make bicameral
legislatures work.  Saturday mornings sometimes seem to be
more or less alternately divided between the garden and
voting.  The national word has to be a political one.

Max Harris, a columnist in the *Australian* (our own
Murdoch newspaper), recently lamented that we have no
political words of our own but take over terms like *pork-barreling*
from the USA.  He was wrong.  We have *informal
vote* to start with (a spoiled or invalid vote elsewhere), and
because of our preferential voting system and resulting long
lists of candidates, along with compulsory voting, the *donkey
vote*.  This is simply numbering the list of names from top to
bottom without paying attention to policies or parties.  The
donkey vote can be worth as much as two percent of a total
vote, so that candidates await the ballot for position on the
voting paper with some trepidation.

In the past year the dominant political term has been
*bottom of the harbor*, used to describe shady schemes just
within the law or a bit outside it for avoiding tax.  Already the
origin of the term seems to be disappearing in the mists of
recent antiquity; perhaps it hints that the records of evanescent
dummy companies have been conveniently dumped where
they can't be found.

A preoccupation with taxation has led to a fine distinction
between *tax evasion* (the illegal practices of others) and *tax
avoidance* (the quite legitimate minimization of tax one feels
one ought to pay attention to oneself for the sake of one's
family).  Everyone saw the need for a distinction of this kind
until our new Prime Minister (I am told) in a speech allowed
the carefully separated terms to coalesce in a slip of the tongue.
Or it may be, as some say, that our new Prime Minister
(already becoming something of a legend) does not make slips
of the tongue.  Be that as it may, the distinction between
legitimate and illegitimate ways of not paying tax to the
Government has been shattered at a blow and the winning
word in the competition and our new national word is *avoision*.

## Language Crimes: The Case of the Purloined Negatives
*Richard L. Faust, New York, New York*

It was the first day in May and I had a terrible case of spring
fever.  As I approached my office door, a honey bee was
buzzing against the glass panel, nuzzling my painted name,
AHA, as if it were a flower.  It ignored the other two words:
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.  With a smile, I brushed it away,
unlocked the door, and entered.

The office was bathed in fresh spring light, the kind of
glow that smooths out cracks and blemishes (like a dowager's
facelift) and turns the water cooler into a crystal grotto.  The
day was starting out as positively perfect.

But my oriental ancestors always warned, &ldquo;When the
clock shows noon, it also shows midnight.&rdquo;  I remembered their
wisdom when exactly at noon there was a knock on my door.  It
plunged me into a case that would take me into the deepest
reaches of man's psyche.

&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;  I said, and the day turned around.

He looked like Hollywood's version of a doctor—bright
eyes peering through wire-rimmed glasses, a small goatee and
moustache, strong, scrubbed hands, and although he was
wearing a conservatively cut suit, you could swear he was in a
white smock with a stethoscope around his neck.  And he
confirmed my impression by saying in a firm, comforting voice:

>&ldquo;I'm Dr. Logomann of the Verbal Psychiatric Institute.
May I sit down?&rdquo;</quote>

I had heard of the place.  It took on hopeless cases, socially
unacceptable misfits, and gave them &ldquo;Negative Removal Therapy.&rdquo;
What they did exactly, nobody knew, but there were
some notable successes, such as the famous lawyer Reed
Tractable.

&ldquo;What may I do for you?&rdquo;  I said, tempted to say, &ldquo;Open
your mouth and say 'Aha.' &rdquo;

&ldquo;We have a problem at the Institute.  Just this morning I
discovered that some of our negatives have been stolen.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Do you mean *film* negatives?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, these are our stored negative elements, the ones we
remove from our patients.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why haven't you called the police?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I prefer to handle it quietly, since it is clear that only one
of our patients could have taken them.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Where were the negatives kept?&rdquo;

&ldquo;In an unlocked room in the East Wing, where all of our
present patients now live.  It is not generally known, but the
Institute has fallen upon hard times.  We have only five patients
now, and I have had to let all the other doctors go.  Those five
are still with me because, and I tell you this confidentially, they
may never be able to go back into society.  It is something we
therapists did not foresee.  With their negative elements
removed, they are still unacceptable to the vast public.  Here is
a list of their names; you will see that their positive characters
are unorthodox.&rdquo;

The list was neatly typed: Bob Gruntled, Marvin Kempt,
Vic Seemly, Jack Descript, and Bill Ruly.

I read the list again.  What's in a name?  In this case
everything was.

&ldquo;You see now why people would never employ them in
normal circumstances.  In a sense, their positive characters
don't exist in the real world.  It is quite a dilemma.  By taking
away their negative elements, we made them better, but they
can only live at the Institute.  And if business continues to get
worse, I will have to let them revert and release them.  Now
you know why I don't want the police or the press to learn
about this.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why were the negative particles not destroyed?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Part of our therapy is to let the patients have easy access
to their former selves, the way reformed alcoholics often keep a
bottle of whiskey around.  It removes a lot of the early anxiety.
The negatives were neatly labeled and kept in clearly marked
files.  The negative elements of all former patients are locked
away in our basement vault as soon as each patient rejoins
society.  The vault has not been touched.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Tell me, doctor, what use could someone make of a
negative particle?&rdquo;

&ldquo;That's what you must discover.  I want them back right
away.  This could precipitate a crisis.&rdquo;

I decided to take on the case.  My first stop, as usual, was
to talk with my old friend Billy Emerald, lex guard at the
Oakland dictionary depot.

&ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;why would someone want to steal some
negative language particles?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;haven't you heard how much parts are
selling for on the black market?  It's big business.  First, the
plagiarists steal the prose and sell it to the strippers.  These days
there are gangs of rogue grammarians roving around out there
who can break down a sentence into its component parts in
less than a minute.  Nouns are most in demand, but everything
has its price—prepositions, particles, articles.  I've heard of
secret assembly plants where whole new books are forged out
of words the plagiarists have stolen.  They do such a good job
that Lincoln wouldn't be able to recognize his Gettysburg
Address after they have rearranged the parts.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Who's the big dealer in these parts?&rdquo;

&ldquo;A guy called Smithy is the best.  He's a pro, a
wordwright.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Thanks, Billy.&rdquo;

Could Dr. Logomann be selling off the negatives to raise
money for the Institute?  But why hire me, then?

I knew I could find Smithy in the Village at a bar called
The Spreading Chestnut Tree.  I hadn't been to the Village in a
long time.  It was a sink of porno palaces and sleazy hotels
where you could get anything you wanted in the way of sex or
drugs.  And now they had added the parts business.

The Spreading Chestnut Tree was a dive.  Going from the
bright sunlight into the dark bar was like descending into Hell.
Red lights from the juke box in the corner turned the
atmosphere to flame.  The place smelled of booze and broken
hearts.  It was too early for the night people; only the bartender
was there, and when I asked for Smithy, he nodded toward the
side room.

I walked deeper into the murk.  There he stood—Smithy
was a tall black man with large sinewy hands.  The muscles in
his forearms looked strong as iron bands.

&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you oriental devil you.  What brings you
here?&rdquo;

I had once saved Smithy from a forging charge.  He owed
me a favor.

&ldquo;Did you buy five negative parts last night?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I need to get them back.  Can you arrange it?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Will this make us even?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Okay.  But I got only four parts from the guy; that's all he
was selling.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Four parts!  What did he look like?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Sort of ordinary, nothing special.  Just a guy.  What did
you expect him to look like, Rasputin?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Deliver the parts tonight at nine to the Verbal Psychiatric
Institute.  Address the package to me.&rdquo;

I came up into the light and heaved a sigh of relief.  I had
solved the case.  I knew who did it, and the returned parts
would prove it.

That night they were all assembled in the Staff Lounge—
Dr. Logomann and his five hapless patients, all of whom looked
quite ordinary and normal; but one was a diabolical thief.

&ldquo;They have all been told about the disappearance,&rdquo; said
the doctor.

The package had arrived.  Time to begin the show.

&ldquo;The thief,&rdquo; I announced, &ldquo;made one mistake: he sold
only four of the negative particles—and I have them here.
Why?  Because he needed the fifth as his disguise.  He assumed
his previous character in order to go unremembered in the
outside world.  Only one of you could do that.&rdquo;

I opened the box and took out one of the labeled parts.  It
was UN, and Seemly, when he saw it, made an obscene remark.
The second was also UN, and Ruly knocked over his chair.  The
third was another UN, and Kempt kicked off his shoes and
loosened his tie.  The fourth and last was DIS, and Gruntled
grumbled something and squirmed.  The missing part was NON.
We all turned toward the guilty one.

&ldquo;That's right; I did it,&rdquo; said Jack Descript.  &ldquo;You all don't
know what it's like to be nondescript all your life.  All of you
had some strong personality trait—people noticed you wherever
you went, even if they didn't like you.  But I was no one, no
one until I came here.  It has been the best time of my life.
When I saw the hospital closing down and the doctors leaving,
I feared the worst.  I was afraid we might be forced back into
society, and I didn't want to leave.  I tried to get rid of our
negative parts so that Dr. Logomann would have to keep us
here forever, all five of us.  I don't want to go.&rdquo;  He started
weeping.

The doctor thanked me and said he would take over from
there.  They found the NON particle, slightly singed, lying in the
rubbish where Descript had thrown it that morning after trying
to burn it.

As I approached my office door, I looked for the bee, but
it had gone to its hive hours ago.  I switched on the desk lamp
and started to write up the case, feeling very depressed.  My
oriental ancestors often said, &ldquo;To enjoy the dawn you must first
know the darkness.&rdquo;  At midnight I turned off the lamp and
headed home to sleep.  All those negatives had positively
exhausted me.

## Hwat, Hwere, Hwen, Hwich, ... and Hwy
*Henry M. Truby, South Miami, Florida*

If one consults any reputable contemporary dictionary
regarding the pronunciation of *what, where, when, which*,
and *why*, one is certain to find, respectively, HWUT/HWOT or
WUT/WOT, HWER or WER, HWEN or WEN, HWICH or WICH, and
HW&Imacr; or W&Imacr;.  Earlier in this century, and in previous centuries,
only the *hw*- varieties were reported—or &ldquo;authorized&rdquo;—in
dictionaries.  Historically, in Old English (or Anglo-Saxon)
times, i.e., c.450—c.1150, *hw*- was the prevailing orthography
for the beginning of each of the above terms spelt *wh*- at
present.

One cannot pronounce the sequence *wh*-.  One either
pronounces *hw-* or merely *w-*, or merely *h-* (as in, e.g., *who,
whom, whole*, or *whore*).  The result, in our time, of the *wh-/w-*
coalescence, is a new set of homophones including: *when/wen,
where/wear, which/witch, why/Y, whale/wail, whet/wet,
wheel/weal/we'll, whether/weather, whey/way/weigh, while/
wile, whine/wine, whinny/Winnie, whip/Wip*, and *whit/wit*,
among others.

*Homophones* (by definition: 'same sound, different spelling')
spawn oral-aural ambiguity, but the *wh-/w-* phonetic
coalescence to *w-* has also harvested doubt among &ldquo;poor
spellers&rdquo; as to how to spell, e.g., *whack, whacky, wham, wharf,
wheat, wheedle, wheeze, whelp, whelm, whence, whim, whimper,
whimsy, whirl, whisk(e)y, whisper, whistle, white, whittle*,
and *whiz.  [Homonyms* are 'forms of different origin with same
sound *and* same spelling,' e.g., *bear* 'endure,' bear 'carry,' *bear*
'animal,' etc.; *bear/bare* are *homophones.]*

I am among those who admittedly lament the pronunciation
loss of this initial *h-*sound in our *wh-*words previously
pronounced *hw-*, though I am aware that this particular elision
has been under way for centuries.  For instance, early American
diaries reflect confusion among diarists as to &ldquo;wich whords
whould be spelt with *w*- alone and wich whith *wh*-.&rdquo;  (For there
were no dictionaries lying about the Colonies to look things up
in, it should be recalled.)  And the phonetic and orthographic
history of initial- *h*-sounds in combination, and of corresponding
initial-*h* spellings, reflects the steady disappearance, phonetically
and orthographically, of *h-* in English: OE *hraf* became
ModE *roof, hreaw* became *raw, hr&aelig;fn* became *raven, hreod*
became *reed, hreol* became *reel, hrer* became *rare, hring*
became *ring, hlaf* became *loaf, hl&aelig;der* became *ladder, hl&aelig;n*
became *lean, hl&aelig;fdige/hlafdie* became *lady, hlid* became *lid,
hlot* became *lot;* and, analogously, *human* (though of Latin
ancestry) is as often &ldquo;YOOm'n&rdquo; as it is &ldquo;HYOOm'n&rdquo; across the
English-speaking population, as is English *huge* both &ldquo;YOOJ&rdquo;
and &ldquo;HYOOJ.&rdquo;

As for the *hw-/wh-* terms which in Modern English are
pronounced with initial *h*-, OE *hwa* and *hwam* came to be
spelled with *wh-* (as *who* and *whom*) in unsophisticated
analogy with the other *hw-/wh-* terms.  This particular *h-*sound
is almost unique with the *who* family and its offshoots (*whose,
whoever, whosever, whomever, whosoever, whomsoever*, etc.),
except for a few words which were *miss*pelled with *wh-* by
false analogy with the *who* family, as OE *hal* and *hore*, which
became, respectively, *whole* and *whore*.

The fixing of this orthographic metathesis from *hw-* to *wh-*
coincides with the advent of the English printing press [Caxton:
1476], AT WICH TIME THERE WHERE NO BOOKS TO
CONSULT... and printers, following their own practices,
printed those *w-*terms they were &ldquo;sure of&rdquo; with initial *w*-, and
those *hw-*terms they were &ldquo;sure of&rdquo; with initial *wh-* (but which
for them were also pronounced as if they were *w*-terms), thus
inadvertently mistransposing orthographic *hw-* for all times to
*wh-*.  Even *present-day* Cockney bears anything but silent
testimony to the &ldquo;instinctive confusion about initial *h* among
English speakers,&rdquo; *hwether* or not in combination with other
consonants.

The term *two* (OE *twa*) bears an analogy with *who* (OE
*hwa*) in eliding the historically functional *w-*sound [more
accurately, the *-w-*sound].  (All the other *tw-*terms related to
'two' *retained* the *-w-*sound: *twice, twin, twig, twain, twine,
twenty, twelve, twelfth, twill, twist*, and *betwixt* and *between*.)

Language *change* is an inevitable, ever-ongoing process.
All the &ldquo;living language&rdquo; aspects—pronunciation, meaning,
grammar, spelling—are caught up in this flux, most often
without warning, and certainly often &ldquo;without rhyme or reason.&rdquo;
But once in a while, a prospective change is, in some
measure, predictable.  For instance, with impetus from such
advertising contrivances as *Redi-Wip* and *Cheez-Wiz* to speed
us on our way, a century down the road will find our language
with *wut, were* (homophone of *wear*), *wen, wich*, and *wy.  Who*
will be the last to go, orthographically ... and nobody alive will
even *remember* &ldquo;whom,&rdquo; with the exception of a few linguists
and grammarians and lexicographers...  (It is hard enough to
imagine a &ldquo;new&rdquo; *ho* (rhyming with *to, two*, and *do*), much less
a &ldquo;new&rdquo; *hom* (rhyming with *room, tomb*, and *plume*)!  We'll
surely settle for *hoo*.)

I'm fond of my *hwys* and *hwerefores*, already almost
anachronistic, and my very last gasps will preserve the *spiritus
asper* ('rough breathing') of all my aspirating ancestors, as I
wonder: *&ldquo;Hwat's* up?  *Hwere* to now?  *Hwen*'ll I get there?
*Hwich* way am I going?  and ... *Hwy* me?!&rdquo;

Say *Hwen*.

## English Words in Italian: Florence, Italy
*A Cast of Thousands, Risa Bernstein Sodi*

Just this year, France has once again taken up its age-old cry
to de-Anglicize the French language.  The Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise
periodically tries to weed its garden of its English
creepers and American crabgrass but, predictably, to little
avail.  Jack Lang, the former Minister of Culture, recently took
hoe in hand and lashed out at all things American: from TV
shows, to computer innovations, to movies, to overseas investments.
But his number-one target was unmistakably the language
itself, and we language lovers know that it is indeed the
root of the problem.

The French furor made me look a bit closer to home, to
my adoptive subalpine home, Italy.  My fellow Italians are
much more laissez-faire than the French.  In fact, instead of
rejecting Americana, they welcome it with open arms.  One
even gets the feeling that, if it isn't American, it isn't chic.
How else to explain TV ads that say, *Taste the world of
Cinzano* on Italian state TV, bars with names like *Salt Peanuts*
or *Pop-in*, and Italian-made *Big Babol* (pronounced &ldquo;bubble&rdquo;)
chewing gum by *Brooklyn?*  Every neighborhood has a selection
of *supermercati* and at least one specialty shop selling everything
from peanut butter, to maple syrup, to chili ketchup.  And
what self-respecting, self-styled &ldquo;in&rdquo; bar could possibly do
without *caff&eacute; americano?*

But getting back to the root of the problem, everyday
language is really where one sees the Anglo-American influence.
Not just erudite journalists or well-traveled &ldquo;jet-setters&rdquo;
but even the man-in-the-street is able to tell you what a
*blackout*, a *bunker*, and a *bestseller* are.  Psychiatrists speak of
*insight, feedback*, and *input*, while surgeons perform *by-pass*
(operations) or implant *pacemakers*.  Of course, the computer
industry is dominated by American jargon, beginning with
*hardware* and *software* and ending with *bytes*; and electromechanics
boasts a wide array of English terms: *inverter,
wire-up*, and *chopper*, to name but a few.  But there are much
more insidious and widespread uses of English in the Italian
language.

On Fridays at 1 p.m., I usually turn on the RAI state radio
for the *countdown* of this week's *top ten*.  My favorite *d.j.* plays
all my favorite *hits* from the American, English, and Italian
*charts: rock, country* (a catch-all word that, in Italian, has come
to include everything from Neil Young to Pat Boone), and *easy
listening*.  If I think a *single* has that special *feeling* or *sound*, I
can buy the *LP* at my corner record store.  Or, in the
meantime, I can always play it on the *jukebox* in the neighborhood
*bar* (that is, if I can hear it above the whir of the
*flippers*—pin-ball machines—and the zaps of the *videogames*).
Once I bring my *album* back to the *privacy* of my home, I can
either flip it on the *hi-fi* or stack it in my record *library*.

Later on, there is a *telefilm* on TV (not to be confused
with the South American *telenovellas*, or soap operas).
Although it is set in Italy, I see that the main characters are
going to a *cocktail party* for a *drink* (the wife says she only
wants a *drinkino*—a small drink); all the *bigs* and *VIPs* will be
there.  Afterwards, there will be a *barbecue* with a variety of
*sandwiches*, some sliced *rosbif, hamburgers*, and *plumcake*.
The only thing that seems to be missing are the *tosts*, but that's
bar-fare, to be nibbled with a *Coke*, a *7-Up*, or a *Sprite* (the
drink with the *gusto light* 'light taste').

You may ask, what are *tosts?*  Why 'toasts,' of course!  But
beware: this is one English loanword that parts company with
its original meaning.  If you order one in an Italian bar, you will
be served a toasted ham-and-cheese sandwich, not the usual foil
for butter and jam.  There are several other examples of such
altered loanwords.  For instance, Marcello Mastroianni has a
*flirt* with Catherine Deneuve, not an affair or fling.  A *crack* is a
(stock-market) 'crash.'  *Pullmans* are 'motorcoaches,' not railway
cars, and a *jolly* is a 'joker,' as in card games.  *Box*, that most
versatile word, has at least three separate Italian meanings,
although only one of them (the last) is also shared in English:
'playpen,' 'garage,' and 'stall for animals.&rdquo;  If you feel like
kicking up your heels, a *dancing* 'dance hall' is the perfect spot,
and after a few whirls, you may be ready to go home to your
*residence* a 'residential hotel' in Italian.

Other English compound words are conveniently halved
for pronunciation's sake: *nightclub* becomes *night, lipstick*, a
*lip*, and *basketball, basket*.  The same goes for *beauty(case),
pull(over)*, and that business twosome, the *holding (company)*.
By the same token, a *full* is a *full house* in poker, and a *body* is
a *body suit*.

Business has made a killing in the field of English terms.
The *management* of an *import/export* firm may worry about its
*turnover, marketing*, and *stoccaggio* ('goods in stock').  It exults
when there is a *boom*, frets when there is a *boicottaggio* (from
the verb *boicottare*), and is reassured when the *prime rate* is
lowered.  Its *market managers* study the company's *database*,
exchange *telexes* with the *holding* and their *off-shore* banks,
and then come up with the *slogans* for next year's *PR*
campaign.  (One Italian firm even uses Mark Spitz as its *public
relation spokesmen* [*sic*].)  Then again, they may just decide to
keep the *business* as is.

But back to my weekend entertainment....

Friday night is *poker* night.  We all get together in a local
hotel with some *scotch* or *gin* and, maybe, some *popcorn* or
*crackers* to munch on.  The only disturbance is the sound of the
*clacsons (klaxons)* outside or the noise from the nearby *luna
park* ('amusement park').  Three of us are at the table: one
drove his *jeep*, one rode his *scooter*, and I took the *tranvai* (the
Italian rendering of *tramway*).  Our fourth, a whiz at bluffing
*(bluffare)*, is late because his *volo charter* 'charter flight' was
delayed at *check-in*.  He called from a nearby *tea room* to say he
is having a *snack* with the *hostess* ('air hostess' or 'stewardess')
and then may do some *shopping* before joining us.  While we
are waiting, we play a quick hand of *bridge* and then,
impatient, turn on the *tiv&ugrave;* 'TV.'

At 8:30, there is a *prime-time* variety *show*, featuring *gags,
sketches, showmen, performers,* and breathtaking *numeri* ('numbers')
from a sumptuously appointed *set.*  The *cameramen zoom*
in (from *zoomare*) on the *star* as she starts her *tip-tap* ('tap
dance').  It's easy to see why she was considered a *pin-up*
during the war since she's still quite a *sex symbol* even now.
Suddenly, she's interrupted by a *news flash*.  A *reporter* appears
to inform us that the Bulgarian *connection* has produced new
leads (born as the *caso bulgaro*, this international intrigue was
soon rebaptized the Bulgarian connection in homage to *The
New York Times*).  For now, the news is *top secret*, but the
*intelligence gap* is being bridged.  Stoney-faced party *leaders
say No comment* during their *interviste* ('interviews'), but the
*anchor* assures us that an 11:00 *special* will give us full details
on the *scoop*.  Then at 9:30, the *films* come on.  Your preference?
A *shocking*, a *thrilling*, or a *cult movie?*  Some prefer *suspense*—
but that's for a French word list.

Lest you think that English loanwords are limited to the
*mass media*, let's turn to that most Italian of occupations:
*calcio*, or 'soccer,' or *football*.  Here, the World Champions
reverently tip their hats to the English influence on the modern
game.  *Offsides, corner*, and *gol* are used every bit as often as
their Italian counterparts, *fuorigioco, calcio d'angolo* and *rete*.
A typical play might run like this: *drib-blaggio* by Tardelli,
*cross* to Graziani, *assist* by Conte, and *gol* by Rossi.  When
cross-town rivals meet, it's a *derby*—not demolition, but almost.
And let's not forget the farm teams—the *under 21* (read:
&ldquo;under ventuno&rdquo;), the *all-stars*, and the *fan clubs*.  Another
sport has a French name and an English structure: *la boxe* with
its thirteen *rounds*.  In Italy, as everywhere else, a *kappa o*
'K.O.' has great *crowd appeal*.  Skiing at Cortina is undoubtedly
chic, but all the more so if you can ask for your *ski-pass* to the
*ski-lift* in English.  And as to summer *sports* (what better name
for them?), tennis requires mastery of a dictionary and not just
the courts: *set, match, topspin*, and *ace* are all pronounced as in
English.  When it comes to athletic *hobbies* for a bit of *relax*, I
prefer *footing* ('jogging') to *windsurfing*, but only because I'm
no good at the *crawl*.

When the mafia moved to America, it widened its linguistic
as well as criminal horizons.  In an import/export operation
that involved more than just underworld activities, it brought
back its own set of loanwords to the peninsula: *racket, killer,
clan, boss* and *revolver*, not to mention their archnemeses,
*detectives, identikits*, and *fotofits* [*sic*].

Walt Disney was the pioneer in a much more pleasant
intercultural exchange.  Thanks to Donald Duck, et al., *bang,
gulp, screech, pow, phew, tuch-tuch, eek, buzz*, and even *cheee-yaarge*
are all part of any cartoon-loving Italian's vocabulary.
(Incidentally, *cartoni animati* is the Italian loan translation of
the English *animated cartoons*).

Today, Italian *teenagers* chew *chewing gum*, wear *clips*
'earrings,' and spend the *weekend* at the beach: *bikinis* for the
girls, *slips* for the boys.  *Topless* is one of the *standard looks* on
the Riviera, where *sexy* is in and *hippie* is out.  And don't even
mention the *fricchettone* look (an Italianization of *freak out*
plus the -*one* augmentative ending): that's only for latter-day
*figli dei fiori* 'flower children' absorbed in *poesia beat*.  Naturally,
the Italian edition of *Cosmopolitan* didn't even mention
hippies in its recent classification of the modern man.  In its
view, men come only in four varieties: *gay, macho, latin lovers*
and *self-made*.

Weekends are perfect for scouring the countryside for
small-town *happenings*.  Local Sunday fairs often provide
delightful glimpses of authentic *folklore*, far from the *stress* of
city life, *grattacieli* 'skyscrapers,' or *shopping centers*.  Once
among the olive groves and vineyards, you may be convinced
that the grafiti artists aren't all wrong: perhaps our urbanized
world really is *in tilt* ('on the blink,' in *flipper* lingo).

I tend to be a bit less drastic.  It is obvious, however, that
the number of English words in common Italian usage is
growing everyday.  In this brief list, we can see an assortment
of them, from straight carryovers (*leader, ski-pass*), to literal
translations (*figli dei fiori, grattacieli*), to partial translations
where an Italian suffix is tacked on to an English stem (such as
*drib-blaggio* or *zoomare*).  Then there are a certain number of
English words which, when transposed into Italian, just seem
to fall short of their original meanings (*flirt* for 'fling,' *tip-tap*
for 'tap dancing,' or *flipper* for 'pin-ball').  Lastly, some English
words are used as gerunds in Italian instead of as nouns (for
example, *thrilling, dancing*, or *shocking*).

In any case, whatever be their form, the fact is that the
use of English words in Italian is on the rise.  Fields as diverse
as politics, music, and sports are all affected and are absorbing
new words at an astonishing rate.  The outcome—increased
Anglicization (or Americanization, if you will) of the Italian
language—is neither the result of scheming nor design, but
instead the end product of a brisk exchange between a prolific
exporter and a willing importer.  It seems that no matter which
way you look at it, Italy's *love story* with the English language
is in full bloom.

### SCHOLEGRAPHIA: [*Option, The Double-Sided Word Game*](https://www.amazon.com/Option-Double-sided-Word-Parker-Brothers/dp/B0018CDPTC)
*Parker Brothers*

The inevitable comparison is between *Option* and *Scrabble*.
Everyone knows *Scrabble*, or so I assume.  *Option* has a
&ldquo;board&rdquo; that consists of two plastic pieces that fit together to
make a plain, brownish-maroon square about 13&frac34;&rdquo; on a side,
patterned with 256 rectangular holes.  The set includes a plastic
bag (opaque), 4 racks, and 96 letter prisms.  What is a letter
prism, you ask?  A letter prism is a tentlike plastic prism, closed
at the ends, open on one side, and bearing letters and scoring
points on the other two sides.  When a letter prism is placed on
the board, one side faces upwards.

The play is similar to that of *Scrabble*: each player takes
seven prisms and arrays them on his rack.  At once, the player
sees that one of the two letter-bearing sides has a dark brown
letter on a light-beige field, the other a light-beige letter on a
dark brown field.  (Does one dare to suppose that the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
colors of VERBATIM have been used?)  Thus, with the prisms
arrayed before him, the player can see both letters on each
prism, giving him a choice of 14, rather than seven, letters
from which to form words.  Although the play is essentially the
same as for *Scrabble*, the scoring is different: words of all beige
or all brown letters are scored double the sum of the letter
values, provided the word is of five or more letters.  Also, the
player has the option (get it?) to pivot a letter in a word
already made (if a legitimate word is so formed) and to use it
in a new word.  For instance, if SEX is horizontal on the board,
and the next player wants to form THERE vertically, he can flip
the s tile to reveal the H, forming THERE using the H of HEX,
and collecting points for both words.

I played three games with friends, who prefer to remain
unidentified because I won, 448 to 220, 381 to 303 and 311 to 1.    Scoring should not be compared to that of *Scrabble*,
because the method is different: placement of prisms on the
board is irrelevant; the heavy scoring comes from using all
seven prisms and from making words all in the same color.  In
other words, *Option* is a simple game to learn to play, which
can be said about all good games.  It also offers much more than
double the number of opportunities for making words (though,
because of the distribution of letters on the prisms, it is not a
factorial function).  It takes a little getting used to to have 14
anagrammatic options open to you (plus what may be on the
board), and the game is somewhat slower because of the
additional possibilities.  It is, in some ways, more challenging
than *Scrabble* because of the added opportunities afforded both
by having 14 letters and by being able to flip prisms on the
board.  As I have played only three times, I cannot say how
addictive *Option* might become, but I think it has great
possibilities.  My opponents and I enjoyed playing the game
immensely, though I enjoyed winning more than they enjoyed
losing.

I do have a couple of criticisms, however: first, the prisms,
which are made of hollow plastic, are too light and are difficult
to handle; second, the rack is a bit awkward.  Similar to the
*Scrabble* rack, the *Option* rack is tilted a little more to the
vertical so that the player views the prisms edge-on, allowing
him to see both letters.  But it, too, is light and tended to skitter
about on the smooth surface where we were playing.  One
might assume that, given sufficient encouragement from sales,
Parker Brothers will soon offer *Option* sets with wooden prisms
and racks—perhaps diamond-studded if business really booms.
And there is no reason why it shouldn't.  Buy it—or should I say
&ldquo;Take the Option!&rdquo;—you will probably like it and may even
switch your allegiance from *Scrabble*.

*Scrabble* boards list all of the tiles and their quantities.
*Option* doesn't, so, in the interests of usefulness, here is the
breakdown (with scoring points):

| QTY | BROWN LETTER | SCORE | BEIGE LETTER ON OTHER SIDE   |
| --- | ------------ | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 8   | A            | 2     | E, E, I, I, O, O, R, U       |

#### EPISTOLA {W. M. Woods}

Marcy S. Powell's interesting article *Traduttore Traditore*
[X, 1] reminds me of an incident about 20 years ago.  I was
scanning a French scientific publication, which contained
abstracts, in French, of articles in several other publications
written in various languages.  My eye fell upon the term
*matelots gel&eacute;s*, which means 'frozen sailors.'  The context was
no help, and although I had no interest in the apparent subject,
my curiosity drove me to look up the original article, which
was in English.

The article was about frozen semen.

*[W. M. Woods, Oak Ridge, Tennessee]*

## A Compound Subject
*Richard Lederer, St. Paul's School*

Since the dawn of the English language, speakers and
writers of English, true to the Germanic roots of their
tongue, have created thousands of new words by joining
together two (or more) independent morphemes to form compounds.
As any page of Anglo-Saxon literature illustrates,
compound words were abundant in Old English, a language
that sought to express new ideas not by borrowing from foreign
shores but by combining words already in the native
vocabulary.

Thus, in the Beowulf poem the ocean is the *sea-path,
whale-road*, or *swan-road*.  A ship is a *sea-wood* and a harp a
*pleasure-wood*.  A warrior is called a *shield-bearer*, his sword a
*battle-friend*, and war a *battle-play*.  The body is a *bone-house*
or *flesh-clothing*.

Some of the oldest words in English are disguised compounds,
the elements of which have been so closely welded
together that they are no longer perceived as two-morpheme
entities.  The word *daisy* was fashioned by speakers of Old
English from the poetical &ldquo;day's eye.&rdquo;  Few people today think
of *daisy* as containing two parts, although Geoffrey Chaucer,
without benefit of any etymological elbow book, guessed well
when, in the Prologue to *The Legend of Good Women*, he
referred to the sun as &ldquo;the dayesy&emacr;, or elles the y&emacr; [eye] of
day.&rdquo;

Other words quite changed from their formerly compounded
state include *gospel* (originally g&omacr;dspel, 'good tidings'),
husband (*h&umacr;sbonda*, 'house dweller'), *sheriff* ('Shire-reeve'), and
*answer* ('and swear').  &ldquo;God be with you&rdquo; has become *good-bye*,
and *All-hallow-even* and *Cristes m&aelig;sse* (&ldquo;Christ's mass&rdquo;) have
turned into *Halloween* and *Christmas*.

When the spelling and pronunciation of compound elements
change, meaning often does, too.  *Holiday* comes from
&ldquo;holyday,&rdquo; but many holidays, like Independence Day and
Labor Day, are not holy.  A *bonfire*, earlier a &ldquo;bone-fire,&rdquo;
seldom burns bones.  Even when the spelling is retained in both
halves, the pronunciation may change in such a way that it
obscures the compound nature of the word.  How conscious are
you of the compound elements in the following words, and
how do you pronounce them?:

>*atone*        
*background*   
*blackguard*   
*boatswain*    
*breakfast*  
*clapboard*    
*coxswain*     
*cupboard*     
*forecastle*   
*handkerchief*  
*necklace*  
*vineyard*  
*waistcoat*

Extensive borrowing from Latin, Greek, and French,
languages that lack the compound-making enthusiasm of English,
has not halted the proliferation of compound words in our
tongue.  We continue to yoke words together, especially in
America, from the early *backwoods, sourwood, butternut*, and
*selectman* to the contemporary *pantyhose, waterbed*, and *software*.
In *The American Language*, H. L. Mencken points with
great pride to our love of compound words:

>In them America exhibits its habit of achieving short
cuts by bold combinations.  Why describe a gigantic
rainstorm with the lame adjectives of every day?  Call
it a *cloudburst* and immediately a vivid picture is
conjured up.  *Roughneck* is more apposite and savory
than any English equivalent, and unmistakably American.
The same instinct for the terse, the vivid, and the
picturesque appears in *boiled shirt, claim jumper, home
stretch, comedown, bottom dollar, cold snap, crazy
quilt, ticket scalper, prairie schooner*, and *flatboat*.

How can we know for certain when two words have
become a compound word?  How can we make precise distinctions
between two separate words like *black bird* ('a bird that is
black') and *blackbird* ('a species of bird') or *hot dog* ('perspiring
canine') and *hot dog* ('frankfurter')?  One method is to listen for
the presence of contrasting stress, which, in almost all noun
compounds, means heavy forestress.  Say aloud the pairs of
sentences below, noting how you distinguish in speech between
the two separate words and the compound words:

>1.  Walking down the street, I saw a *hot dog*.
Walking down the street, I ate a *hot dog*.
>2.  Mary lives in a *white house*.
The President lives in the *White House*.
>3.  I ride on *one horse*.
I live in a *one-horse* town.
>4.  He scolded the *dumb waiter*.
He loaded the *dumbwaiter*.

In the second sentence of each pair we see the three ways
that compound words may be written—open (*hot dog, White
House*), hyphenated (*one-horse*), and solid (*dumbwaiter*).  But in
each example the stress falls heavily on the first element, and
there is no pause between the two parts as we speak the word.
This contrasting stress pattern helps to emphasize the close
connection between the elements and often endows the whole
compound with a special meaning.

A few more examples will serve to show how dramatically
words can change meaning when they are merged into compounds.
We all know what the color black looks like, but we
seldom think twice about the fact that blackbirds, blackberries,
and blackboards are not always black.  The blackbird hen is
actually brown; blackberries are red before they are ripe; and,
nowadays, many blackboards are green or some other color.
Similarly, fastfood eateries often dispense plastic &ldquo;silverware,&rdquo;
hot dogs are cold in the refrigerator, the light can be on in a
darkroom, homework can be done at school, cupboards don't
have to contain cups or boards, and bathrooms often don't
have baths in them.  In fact, a bathroom isn't always a room,
since a dog can &ldquo;go to the bathroom&rdquo; under a tree.

The characteristic stress pattern and the special meaning
of compounds welds the parts together into units that cannot
be separated.  We can talk about a &ldquo;dumb, clumsy waiter,&rdquo; but
we cannot interpose a word between the elements in *dumb-waiter*.
We might see a &ldquo;white country house,&rdquo; but we cannot
insert a word in the middle of *White House*.  Further proof of
inseparability in compounds is that we can say &ldquo;a very hot
dog,&rdquo; where &ldquo;very&rdquo; modifies the one word &ldquo;hot,&rdquo; but we
cannot say &ldquo;a very hot dog,&rdquo; where *hot dog* means a sausage.

English compounds are amazingly versatile creatures that
can assume any grammatical function: noun (*earthquake*),
pronoun (*herself*), adjective (*colorblind*), adverb (*sometimes*),
verb (*dryclean*), preposition (*without*), or conjunction (*whenever*).
Moreover, almost any combination of the parts of speech
may be used to form a compound, although some are more
common than others.  Focusing on the four major parts of
speech, the Noun-Adjective-Adverb-Verb matrix below illustrates
the diversity of compound formations in English:

|               | NOUN        | ADJECTIVE     | ADVERB       | VERB        |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **NOUN**      | *spaceship* | *homesick*    | *flashback*  | *godsend*   |
| **ADJECTIVE** | *madman*    | *bittersweet* | *blackout*   | *freeload*  |
| **ADVERB**    | *upshot*    | *evergreen*   | *henceforth* | *underplay* |
| **VERB**      | *scarecrow* | *fail-safe*   | *tumbledown* | *hearsay*   |

Independent morphemes may marry in such ingenious
ways that the part of speech of a compound may be different
from that of either of its components, as in the last two entries
above: *tumble* (verb) + *down* (adverb) = *tumbledown* (adjective);
*hear* (verb) + *say* (verb) = *hearsay* (noun or adjective).
This happy state of affairs raises the question: can the third
dimension of the four-by-four matrix be filled out so that each
of the sixteen types functions as a noun, adjective, adverb, and
verb, yielding a total of sixty-four entries?  Here is my response
to that burning question, in the form of a four-by-four-by-four
matrix: *Even this matrix does not cover all the possible grammatical alliances.
Additional combinations include *into* (adv + adv = preposition),
*whenever* (adv + adv = conjunction), *he-man* (pronoun + noun
= noun), *each other* (pronoun + adj = pronoun), *himself* (pronoun + noun = pronoun), and *whoever* (pronoun + adv = pronoun).

  |               | NOUN-NOUN    | NOUN-ADJ.       | NOUN-ADVERB  | NOUN-VERB       |
  | ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
  | **NOUN**      | *spaceship*  | *bootblack*     | *flashback*  | *godsend*       |
  | **ADJECTIVE** | *shipshape*  | *homesick*      | *head-on*    | *handmade*      |
  | **ADVERB**    | *sidesaddle* | *knee-deep*     | *hands down* | *shell-shocked* |
  | **VERB**      | *tiptoe*     | *court-martial* | *zero in*    | *handpick*      |
                                      

  |               | ADJ.-NOUN      | ADJ.-ADJ.     | ADJ-ADVERB         | ADJ.-VERB    |
  | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
  | **NOUN**      | *madman*       | *deaf-mute*   | *blackout*         | *slowpoke*   |
  | **ADJECTIVE** | *common-place* | *bittersweet* | *straight-forward* | *rough hewn* |
  | **ADVERB**    | *barefoot*     | *northeast*   | *moreover*         | *roughshod*  |
  | **VERB**      | *blackball*    | *high-low*    | *black in*         | *freeload*   |

                                                                   
|               | ADVERB-NOUN | ADVERB-ADJ. | ADVERB-ADVERB  | ADVERB-VERB   |

| **ADJECTIVE** | *offhand*   | *overdue*   | *never-never*  | *income*      |
| **ADVERB**    | *overboard* | *outright*  | *henceforth*   | *overmatched* |
| **VERB**      | *outlaw*    | *outsmart*  | *fast forward* | *underplay*   |
                                                              

|               | VERB-NOUN    | VERB-ADJ.     | VERB-ADVERB   | VERB-VERB        |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **NOUN**      | *scarecrow*  | *speakeasy*   | *diehard*     | *hearsay*        |
| **ADJECTIVE** | *breakneck*  | *fail-safe*   | *tumble-down* | *slapdash*       |
| **ADVERB**    | *makeshift*  | *punch-drunk* | *worn out*    | *straddle mount* |
| **VERB**      | *pickpocket* | *blow dry*    | *give up*     | *make believe*   |

Most of the items above are self-explanatory, but some
require a brief exegesis.  *Shell-shocked* (n + v = adv), *over-matched*
(adv + v = adv), *punchdrunk* (v + adj = adv), and
*worn out* (v + adv = adv) can function adverbially in
sentences like &ldquo;He staggered from the ring shell-shocked,
overmatched, punchdrunk, and worn out.&rdquo;  *High-low* and *fast
forward* are recent but well-entrenched compounds in English;
one who leads first the high and then the low card of a two-card
suit in bridge *high-lows*; one who presses the cue button
on a tape or video recorder *fast forwards*.

The shiny newness of compounds like *high-low, fast
forward*, and *blow dry* (the only examples I could think of for
their respective slots) indicates the experimental vigor of
twentieth-century English.  I sense a massive, collective consciousness
among English speakers, who, it seems, would not
be satisfied until the language evolved to the point where all
sixty-four slots in the matrix could be filled.

## LIGHT REFRACTIONS
*Thomas H. Middleton, Clown Talk*

Ron Jarvis, a friend of mine who is not only an actor and a
professional clown, but a man with a keen appreciation of
words, shared several hours, a couple of six-packs, and a trove
of circus talk with me recently.  I'm glad I had the presence of
mind to find a tape recorder and get him to back up to where
he'd begun and then keep going with a fascinating discussion
about circuses and particularly about circusese.  Most professions
have their own jargons.  Some are tedious and some
infuriating to the outsider; and some are rich and colorful.  The
circus's jargon, not at all surprisingly, is rich and colorful.

It didn't come as a great surprise that circus people call
the area inside the big top or other circus enclosure &ldquo;the
hippodrome.&rdquo;  One of the dictionary definitions of *hippodrome*
is *circus*.  Within the hippodrome is the *hippodrome track*.  To
assist in the mechanics of preparing the circus show, the
hippodrome track is divided into the *front track* and the *back
track*.  Since the hippodrome track is round, the designations of
back and front tracks are arbitrary.  These are the equivalent of
*downstage* and *upstage* in a proscenium-arch theater.  Without
this convention, it would be next to impossible to direct the
circus show.  Each ring in a circus usually has its track.
European circuses are generally one-ring.  The three-ring circus
was, not surprisingly, an American innovation, America being
the home of &ldquo;More is Better.&rdquo;

I asked Ron if he knew the origin of the expression &ldquo;the
big top,&rdquo; a colorful but not entirely predictable term for an
enormous tent.  He said that in the old days, there were several
tents in the regular circus setup.  There was the big one,
containing the hippodrome, and there were the smaller tents
that contained the menagerie, the freak shows, the &ldquo;balley
girls,&rdquo; and the other attractions on the periphery of the main
show.  These tents lined the midway.  The midway is a thing of
the past.  It was a passage everyone had to go through in order
to get to the big top.  It offered enticements to lure cash from
the crowd before they got to the main show.  The big tent was
called *the big top* to distinguish it from these smaller tents.
O.K., you ask, but how come *big top* instead of *big tent?*  The
smaller tents were never called *little tops*.  Good question.

Now let's move on to those balley girls, also sometimes
called *cootch dancers* or *cooch dancers* or *kooch dancers* or
*kootch dancers*, so named because they danced the *hootchy-kootchy*.
*Balley* is my own spelling.  Ron thought it was
probably *bally*, but I prefer *balley*, because *balley* makes it
fairly clear that the *all* in there rhymes not with *all, ball*, and
*fall*, but with the *all* in *alley*.  &ldquo;Lots of these words weren't
meant to be spelled, anyway,&rdquo; says Ron, which puts us in a
whole new mode of thought, bringing up a vast and complex
host of questions in etymology and linguistics.  Mencken, in his
discussions of circusese, spells it *bally*, but I assert my right to
*balley*.

Clowns are called *Joeys*, after Joseph Grimaldi
(1779-1837), a great English clown and pantomimist.

The great American contribution to clownhood is the
Tramp.  That tramp face was created during the Great Depression,
when hoboes rode the rails.  If you're old enough to have
done much traveling on a train drawn by a coal-fired steam
locomotive, you'll remember the taste and smell and feel of the
soot that permeated even the fanciest passenger cars, and you'll
have little trouble imagining the look of a hobo who had ridden
the rails without benefit of closeable windows.  Their faces were
blackened by the soot, and when they disembarked, they'd
wipe their eyes and their mouths, and that's how Tramp
clowns were born, with their faces blackened except for the
clean areas around the eyes and the mouth.

Clowns, as a rule, are used as a distraction in the circus.  A
very few clowns have developed as circus stars, but clowns are,
for the most part, sent in in a version of the Stephen Sondheim
&ldquo;Send in the Clowns&rdquo; sense, though their routines are more
often employed in covering a shift of paraphernalia than in
distracting the crowd's attention from a tragedy.  Where, in the
theater, a curtain is drawn or the lights are doused, in the
hippodrome the clowns are sent in.

A newcomer to the circus is called a *first-of-May*, because
the circus season starts on the first of May.  &ldquo;He's a first-of-May
Joey&rdquo; means he's a brand-new clown—wet behind the ears.  A
veteran of the circus, on the other hand, is a *30-miler* or a *40-miler*,
from the distance normally traveled between towns in
the old-time circus.  Incidentally, you'll be pegged as a first-of-May
if you don't call the calliope a cally-ope.

A clown's shower-bag is called a *douche bag*.  If you're like
me, your first thought is that *douche bag* must be a joke.  A
moment's reflection, however, in the light of the international
composition of the circus, and you remember that the French
*douche* and the German *Dusche* both mean 'shower,' so the
clown's *douche bag* almost certainly came from the French and
German clowns, and I should think the spelling comes from the
English &ldquo;douche,&rdquo; which, in turn, comes from the French.

We all know that *Hey, Rube!* is the circus cry for help,
shouted when there's trouble.  Ron told me about when he was
with Barnum &amp; Bailey, playing Denver—&ldquo;all these Hungarian
clowns, and we're sitting in a bar with all these local cowboys
hanging around, and the cowboys hear the accents and figure
the Commies have landed.  No shit, I heard more 'Hey Rube!'
calls in Denver than anywhere.  I did a lot of hiding under
tables.&rdquo;

A few more terms:

>*blow-off* the finish of a clown's routine.  Sort of a visual
punch-line.
>
>*bull* any elephant, male or female.
>
>*bull-hook* what the elephant-handler uses to control the
bulls of both sexes.
>
>*cherry pie* extra work taken on to supplement income.
(Ron did laundry for the trapeze artists, acrobats, etc.)
>
>*clown alley* quarters where the clowns dress and make up
before the show.
>
>*dukey* ticket.  (Spelled &ldquo;dukey,&rdquo; I suppose, because it probably
came from a mispronunciation of &ldquo;ducat,&rdquo; but it's
probably one of those words that were never meant to
be spelled.)
>
>*flukum* cotton candy.
>
>*mud* greasepaint.
>
>*redlight* to toss a cheat, thief, or other bad character off a
moving train.  (What is now called, I think, &ldquo;piggy-back
loading,&rdquo; meaning putting cars and trucks on freight
train flatcars used to be called &ldquo;circus loading,&rdquo; because
the first wagons to be loaded on flatcars were circus
wagons and trucks.)
>
>*working the house* strategic sales of popcorn, peanuts, and
other salted goodies to work up a thirst before the
soda-pop is offered.  (The big top has &ldquo;sidewalls,&rdquo; which
can be raised to let in cool air when the weather is
stifling.  Soda-pop concessionaires have been known to
tie the sidewalls down using Gordian knots.)

We recorded several others, but by that time, the six-packs
had progressed to harder stuff, and some of our words are not
entirely clear on my tape, so rest content with these samples, at
least for now.

## The Language of History
*Pamela Webb, Fayetteville, Arkansas*

As a student of history for the past five years, I have
observed with only slight detachment the vagaries of
American use of the English language (or what grammarians of
the purist persuasion call the decline of the language, period).
Struggling to turn out brilliant and yes, even literate, book
reviews and essays proved to be a battle of the will, a Verdun
in the War of the Words I encountered in graduate school.
Words like *concept*:

>Populism is a concept with roots that go back as far as
Andrew Jackson and extend through the years to
Jimmy Carter.

Now, the seminar I sat through passed judgment on *concept* by
noting only, &ldquo;Edwin Newman wouldn't like it.&rdquo;  To be sure,
calling forth an authority is a time-honored tradition, particularly
in history classes, but there is, besides Newman's no-no, a
deeper meaning to a historian's choice of words which may
lead to a naked truth about historians.

To write well on a subject, historians must thoroughly
understand the person or event that consumes their interest.
This means absorbing the archives of a topic—the diaries,
correspondence, manuscripts, the documentation of human
lives.  Early historians of America believed that the past would
be much more vivid and come alive on the page for the reader
if the historian would put down the musty documents and try
to relieve the experience (in 1960s lingo, the historian was
&ldquo;relating&rdquo; to his subject).  Hence the trek of Francis Parkman in
the late 19th century to that bluff overlooking Quebec where
the loss of one fort cost France an empire—and all because he
claimed to have &ldquo;Injuns on the brain.&rdquo;  Almost a century later
Samuel Eliot Morison offered his final words on the discovery
of the New World only after directing an ocean voyage that
retraced in some detail the exact route of Christopher
Columbus.

But what, indeed, does the foregoing have to do with the
use of the word *concept?*  Simply this: the writer who uses that
term tells us about his academic background (sociology, psychology,
or better yet, education) but nothing about the past.
No more than *Christopher Columbus* or *Native Americans* is
Populism a concept.  A body of ideas, certainly; but the late
19th-century agrarian movement that protested northeastern
finance and business monopoly was no abstraction.  It is hard
even to conceive of Populism apart from its leading characters,
Tom Watson and Mary Elizabeth (&ldquo;Raise less corn and more
hell&rdquo;) Lease; and of course, the whole movement was so
personified in the figure of William Jennings Bryan that his rise
was its rise, and his demise, its.  The Populists left a rich
rhetoric for the historian to mull over; the fire and passion of
those silver tongues is still the subject of historical debate, as
are other periods in American history.  But it was Populism that
taught me not to crucify mankind upon a cross of concepts.

Though it may seem that I am doing battle for the Lord
on this issue of *concept*, I am not too self-righteous to admit to
a few errors of my own.  Just the other day I caught myself
asking a colleague if her paper had been *critiqued*, and I
received remonstration from a professor (he wasted my high
esteem earlier by referring to me as his *advisee*) who thought
my use of *hence* was archaic.  I'm staying in the trenches and
fighting it out on that one; to quote William Safire, &ldquo;I like that
word.&rdquo;

Hence, in training for the historian's craft (let's see, that
makes me a trainee), I have concluded that language exposes
human experience, just as history exposes the past.  In essence,
history and language are inseparable.  History is the product,
albeit sifted and sorted through the human mind, of what is
revealed through the written record.  Language, obviously, is
the medium through which humanity records its experience;
but, as the writing of history shows, historians transcend
language as a medium in order to study the language, or the
words themselves, in the context of the time and place in
which they occurred, so that language itself becomes historical
experience.

This phenomenon within the historical profession did not
happen suddenly, and, not too surprisingly, it has matured
along with the development and study of American intellectual
history.  Perry Miller, an eminent spokesman for Puritan intellectual
history, described the Puritans' &ldquo;Errand into the Wilderness&rdquo;
by digging up the second, almost lost, meaning of the
word *errand*.  This was no short trip through the woods as the
first meaning of that word implied, but a 'commission with a
message and a purpose' as the deeper meaning expressed both
in Miller's dictionary and in the Puritan experience in America.

Historians must, by necessity, define terms for clarity and
proper syntax.  The greater task, however, and one in which
history merges with literary art, is, as Cleanth Brooks says, to
&ldquo;peel off the dead skin and callosities from the language ... to
find the same close union between the state of language and
the state of mind.&rdquo;  In the late 1970s Edmund S. Morgan
examined the relationship between Virginia, that most fertile
ground for republicanism and also a most ardent stronghold of
slavery, and the new republic.  By exploring the 18th-century
definition of *liberty*, Morgan discovered the union of language
and mind that accounts for this great paradox in American
history.  Descendants of Jefferson and Madison, from Abraham
Lincoln to Lyndon Johnson, have expanded the meaning of
*liberty*, but those who had starring roles in the birth of the
republic defined *liberty* as a 'state of independence that
remained secure only when it was not threatened by the poor,
dependent elements of the population.'  Because slavery was
profitable, because it kept order, a segment of the population
flourished and grew strong enough to resist the slavery of
colonial status within the British empire.  Morgan's thesis, then,
is that liberty in the 18th century was bound to slavery like the
slaves to their masters, and his book is appropriately entitled
*American Slavery, American Freedom.*

Alexis de Tocqueville, the French journalist who traveled
through the United States in the 1830s, was perhaps the first to
notice how the democratic experience was modifying the
English language:

>The most common innovation is to give an unwonted
meaning to an expression already in use.  That method
is simple, quick, and easy.  No learning is needed to
make use of it, and ignorance itself can make it easier.
But it involves great dangers for the language.  In thus
giving double meanings to one word, democratic peoples
often make both the old and the new signification
ambiguous.  A writer begins by the slight deflection of a
known expression from its original meaning, and he
adapts it, thus modified, as best he can for his purpose.
A second writer twists its meaning in a different direction.
Then comes a third, taking it off down a new
track.  Then, since there is no accepted judge, no permanent
court to decide the meaning of a word, the
phrase is left to wander free.

Those phrases, wandering free, are being rescued by
historians.  A recent labor undertaken by Garry Wills, *The
Invention of America*, seeks to strip 200 years of ideological
baggage and misinterpretation from Jefferson's language in the
Declaration of Independence.  Again, the difficulty is the lost
language of the 18th century, and from this fresh examination
that historic document emerges less as a flat political statement
that &ldquo;all men are created equal&rdquo; than as a world view, an 18th-century
philosophy with specific meaning for phrases such as
*self-evident* and *created equal*.

De Tocqueville understood what historians are beginning
to appreciate, that &ldquo;equality necessarily changes language.&rdquo;
Jefferson's language circumscribed the meaning of *liberty* and
*independence* for the young republic, but he would be the first,
as Edmund Morgan reminds us, to insist that through the ages
those terms and the institutions they represent be expanded
and redefined.  It may be hoped that future generations of
Americans will continue to do so and that American historians
will continue to glean gems of historical truth by exposing our
past—word for word.


#### EPISTOLA {Lillian Mermin Feinsilver}

I was late in seeing Bryan A. Garner's letter in IX, 4.  May
I say that it bolsters my judgment in IX, 3 that he reads too
hurriedly.  He quotes from my letter in the latter issue: &ldquo;...
the decline of standards as exemplified by two books which
should have been unrepresentative of that process...,&rdquo; declaring
that the *which* should be *that*.  Yet he ought to have seen
that *which* is the more graceful term in a clause already
containing a demonstrative *that*.  He also should have noticed
that the Bergen Evans discussion of *what* that he recommends
(mentioned below) contains a restrictive *which*: &ldquo;If...the
meaning is 'I heard the words which he said' ...&rdquo; and that
Follett, although preferring *that* for restrictive clauses, states:
&ldquo;No one could plausibly insist that *which* as a restrictive
relative pronoun is indefensible or incorrect.&rdquo;

Puzzling is the comment regarding Simon's &ldquo;What good is
correct speech and writing...?&rdquo;  Garner repeats his assertion
that the subject phrase is *what good* and that it demands a
singular verb; and he implies that corroboration exists in *Evans*
1957.  Not exactly so.  That work notes that *what* as adjective
may qualify either a singular or a plural noun, as in &ldquo;to what
green altar?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what men or gods are these?&rdquo; but does not
identify the subject in the latter quotation or in one presenting
the adjective *what* for reference to human beings: &ldquo;what child
is this?&rdquo;  Moreover, the foregoing second and third uses are not
strictly comparable to &ldquo;What good is correct speech and
writing?&rdquo;

Further, Garner remarks that his pronouncement of *what
good* as subject is &ldquo;really supererogatory, as *correct speech and
writing* may be seen as expressing a single idea.&rdquo;  That
argument for the singular verb is more convincing (as I
suggested earlier) than the naming of *what good* as subject.
However, the single idea of *correct speech and writing* has
relevance to the number of the verb only if said phrase is the
subject.  Otherwise, Garner's principle expressed in IX, 2 would
call for barbarisms like &ldquo;What is your requirements?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What
good is they?&rdquo;; etc.

Regarding *comprise*, I tripped; and my shin hurts.  Nevertheless,
the other evidence of Simon's shortcomings is not
invalidated.  In chiding me again for not recognizing &ldquo;the worth
of Simon's writings&rdquo; in combating the decline of standards,
Garner misses two points made before: 1) it is because Simon
in the same work uses so many of the locutions he condemns
that the value of the book is diminished (and I was not
discussing his other writing); 2) proper copyediting should have
caught such lapses, which dramatically illustrate Simon's charge
that &ldquo;the real culprits are the editors.&rdquo;  That was, of course, a
major complaint of mine about both *Paradigms Lost* and *The
State of the Language* by Michaels &amp; Ricks.

#### EPISTOLA {N. H. Behr}

In Richard Lederer's entertaining article on &ldquo;Prep School
Slanguage&rdquo; [IX, 4] there is a passage 'Acronymania' which calls
for some comment, because it has a bearing on the meaning of
the terms used by Mr. Lederer.

He defines *acronym* as 'The most extreme form of shortening
... in which words are reduced to their initial letters,' and
he proceeds to give as examples, at St. Paul's School, *DC, OR,
OB, CC* (which he calls a reduplicative acronym), and *PO*.

None of these is usually classified as acronyms, in the
sense understood by most of your readers.  In fact the only
acronym among his examples is SCOPERS, a pronounceable,
albeit unofficial organization, at St. Pauls.

The term *acronym*, although said to have originated some
time in the 1940s, took time to achieve dictionary recognition.
In England it only managed to get into the Addenda of the 4th
edition of the *Concise Oxford Dictionary*, which appeared in
the 1950s.  It is entirely absent in the compendious *Shorter
Oxford*, 1955 edition.

The enormous growth of scientific, political and institutional
names in the last few decades has brought about a great
increase in the number of acronyms in English and other
languages.  The most usual sense of *acronym* is 'a word formed
from the initial letters of other words, as NATO, radar' (*Oxford
American Dictionary*, 1980).  The emphasis is on *word*, which
makes it necessary for an acronym to be capable of pronunciation,
as distinct from other abbreviations which are pronounced
letter by letter, such as DC, OR, etc. as quoted by Mr.
Lederer.

One of the leading tools which help the reader faced by
the ever-growing number of English acronyms and related
terms is Crowley's *Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations
Dictionary* (The Gale Research Co. of Detroit).

In the preface to the 8th edition the following useful
explanation of their approach to the three terms is given:

>An *acronym* is composed of the initial letters or parts
of a compound term.  It is usually *read or spoken as a
single word*, rather than letter by letter.  Examples
include RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) and
LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission
of Radiation).
>
>An *initialism* is also composed of the initial letters or
parts of a compound term but is generally *verbalized
letter by letter*, rather than as a single &ldquo;word.&rdquo;  Examples
include PO (Post Office) and RPM (Revolutions
per Minute).
>
>An *abbreviation* is a shortened form of a word or
words that does not follow the formation of either of
the above.  Examples include Apr (April), Ph. D. (Doctor
of Philosophy), and Dr. (Doctor).
