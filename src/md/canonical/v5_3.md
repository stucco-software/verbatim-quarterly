## Jonson and the Talmudists&mdash;Notes on the History of a Word
*J.H. Neumann, Croton-on-Hudson, New York*

In 1623 a fire broke out in the London home of Ben Jonson,
Shakespeare's friend and fellow-craftsman, destroying
most of his library and all of his unpublished manuscripts.
Among the latter were poems, a play, a historical work,
scholarly notes accumulated during twenty-four years of classical
study, and &ldquo;humbler gleanings&rdquo; in theology.  Poet and
satirist that he was, Jonson celebrated his misfortune in a
half-serious, half-comic poem entitled &ldquo;An Execration upon
Vulcan,&rdquo; in which among other things he reproaches the god
of fire for his undiscriminating voraciousness.  Had he known,
he says, of Vulcan's desire to hold a feast of fire in his home,
he would have supplied him with food a plenty—reams upon
reams of paper, as well as the less important books in his collection—provided
he could only have saved his precious manuscripts.

Among the books he would willingly have sacrificed,
Jonson names some romances like those of Lancelot and
Tristram, narratives of high adventure like those of Roland
and Oliver, stories of magic and fairyland like those of Merlin,
the &ldquo;Legend&rdquo; (that is, a well-known medieval compilation
of miracles about Christian saints), the Koran and—the
Talmud.

The reference to the Talmud raises several questions.
Did Jonson know any Hebrew or Aramaic?  To what extent
was he actually acquainted with the Talmud?  How explain
his allusion to it?

From Jonson's own works we learn that he was indeed
interested in Hebrew.  In his poems and plays, as well as in his
correspondance, there are references to the language of the
Hebrew Bible and to the commentaries of Ibn Ezra, the Kimchis,
and the Aramaic translation of it by Onkelos.  Occasionally,
he alludes to the etymology of a Hebrew word.  In his
&ldquo;Notes for an English Grammar,&rdquo; published shortly after his
death, he draws parallels between Hebrew and English idiom
and syntax, quoting passages from the Bible accurately in
order to bring out points of resemblance and difference.  Moreover,
one of the books in his library which escaped the holocaust
of 1623 was a copy of the Latin version of David Kimchi's
widely known Hebrew dictionary, *Sefer Hashorashim*.

But precisely how much Hebrew did Jonson know?
Some knowledge of it was, so to speak, in the air in the sixteenth
century— a reflection no doubt of Renaissance interest
in the classical languages and Puritan concern with the text
of the Old Testament.  Well-educated Englishmen—and
Englishwomen, too, like Lady Jane Grey, luckless candidate
for the throne of England—acquired at least a smattering of
the language.  Jonson, in addition to being a classical scholar,
was also somewhat of a philologist, interested in the dialects
of his native England and in languages more remote.  Among
the many dictionaries, grammars, and books on language in
his library were works on the decipherment of Egyptian
hieroglyphics and Conrad Gessner's great compilation of
specimens of all the known languages of the world.  Jonson's
interest in Hebrew may therefore be explained on that
ground alone.

On the other hand, there is little to indicate that this interest
was really permanent or deep.  A curious letter by the
seventeenth-century orientalist John Selden has a bearing on
this point.  It seems that Jonson had asked Selden for an explanation
of the Biblical injunction against a man's wearing
the apparel of a woman—a matter of considerable importance
in the Elizabethan theater, in which women's roles
were invariably acted by men, and hence a subject of denunciation
by Puritan divines.  In his reply, Selden tells of his examining
the literal and historical meaning of the passage in
question (which, incidentally, he reproduces in Hebrew) and
summarizes the opinions of the Hebrew commentators on the
Bible as well as those of Christian scholars.  In quoting the Hebrew
passage, Selden transliterates the key words and phrases
in Latin characters and concludes by merely referring to the
Latin and Greek sources, implying that Jonson could read
those for himself.  One should observe in this connection that
Jonson nowhere lays claim to actual proficiency in Hebrew
and Aramaic; and, one might add, Jonson was not a man
likely to hide such a fact from his contemporaries or from
posterity.

There is another reason for doubting Jonson's acquaintance
with the Talmud.  So far as is known, no complete translation
of it had appeared in Jonson's time; the first version of
any part of it, consisting of several tractates in Latin, was
published about twenty-five years after his death.  Whatever
Jonson could have known of the Talmud therefore came to
him from secondary sources: from references in scholastic
literature, from discourses with learned friends like Selden,
and from occasional allusions in Puritan pamphlets.  Certainly
there is no indication in anything that Jonson wrote of personal
contact with it or of special concern with its contents.

An explanation of his reference to the Talmud will lead
us to the history and meaning of the word in English literature.
Like many of his contemporaries, Jonson evidently
thought of the Talmud as a collection of fantastic tales not to
be taken seriously.  That is the significance of his coupling it
with romances of chivalry and the stories of Merlin and the
Legend.  This notion of the contents of the Talmud was common
in Jonson's time; it was the &ldquo;aggadic&rdquo; element of the Talmud,
that is, the use of legend, anecdote, and parable to illustrate
a point of law or a tradition or an episode in history that
elicited the instant attention of Europeans.  The essayist and
philosopher Lord Bacon, writing a few years earlier, had already
coupled the Talmud with the Legend and the Koran.
&ldquo;I would rather believe,&rdquo; he says in his essay &ldquo;On Atheism,&rdquo;
&ldquo;all the fables in the Legend and the Talmud and the Alcoran
than that this frame is without a mind.&rdquo;[^a1] Indeed, throughout
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word Talmud appears
as a synonym for something imaginative and unreal if
not actually absurd.  The Elizabethan pamphleteer and critic
of London life, Thomas Nash, regards &ldquo;this Gogmagog of a
Jewish Talmud&rdquo; as a collection of &ldquo;old-wives' tales&rdquo; when he
alludes to the legend of the rebuilding of the Temple in one
day.  The word to *talmudize*, according to the *Oxford Dictionary*,
meant &ldquo;to mix fact with fable.&rdquo;  During the Puritan
regime in England, when invective and abuse served the
amenities of doctrinal discussion, one of the common insults
to be hurled at an opponent was the charge that he was a talmudist:
at best an impractical dreamer; at worst a hopeless
fool.  A &ldquo;talmudical dotard,&rdquo; exclaims one Puritan divine
pointing a finger of scorn at a brother of the cloth; &ldquo;talmudical
dorbel [blockhead],&rdquo; retorts another in the midst of acrimonious
debate.  Another warns ministers not to preach
&ldquo;poetical fictions, talmudical dreams, or scholastic quiddities&rdquo;
to their congregations.  Even so scholarly and thoughtful
a student as Sir Thomas Browne is more impressed by the
&ldquo;fables of the talmudists&rdquo; than by the philosophical and
moral ideas they are intended to imply.  Milton, genuine admirer
of Hebrew learning though he was and a man not
averse to using &ldquo;Christian talmudic&rdquo; arguments of his own
when occasion required, permits himself one or two uncomplimentary
references to the &ldquo;insulse rules&rdquo; of the
Talmud.  And Bishop Hall, Milton's adversary in a famous
controversy of the period, could find nothing better to say of
the Talmud than that, like the Koran, it abounds with stories
of &ldquo;carnal pleasure, both of the bed and board.&rdquo;

The word fared no better in the eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries.  The usually level-headed Lord Chesterfield,
in one of his letters to his son, comments on the &ldquo;monstrous
extravagancies&rdquo; and absurd stories of the Talmud.  A
certain amount of ridicule, not devoid of malice, was even
directed at the compilers of the Talmud.  Jonathan Swift in
one of his satires ascribes the authorship of the folk-tale of
Dick Whittington and his cat to that &ldquo;mysterious rabbi&rdquo;
Judah Hanassi, editor of the Mishna, the earlier part of the
Talmud.  And early in the nineteenth century, the poet and
philosopher Coleridge, who was not insensitive to the charm
of some rabbinical legends and even thought of publishing a
collection of them, found himself unable to shake off his
chronic ambivalence and speaks contemptuously at one moment
of the &ldquo;puerilities and anilities, some impossible, mostly
incredible, and all so silly and sensual, as befits a dreaming
talmudist.&rdquo;

These notions about the character and content of the
Talmud were not confined to England; they are commonplace
in other European literatures.  Erasmus thought
that the Talmud was so full of the oddest fables— &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo;
he calls them—that it hardly merited serious study.  Rabelais,
in *Pantagruel*, lists a &ldquo;talmudical fool&rdquo; among several hundred
others in his extraordinary catalogue of human stupidity.
Bossuet has this feature in mind when he dismisses the
Talmud for containing &ldquo;un million de fables, toutes impertinentes,
les unes que les autres.&rdquo;  And Luther, no mean hand
at scurrility, relishes the word and its derivatives in his
endless clashes with fellow churchmen.

One can see how the anecdotal and folk-lore material of
talmudic literature played a part in the misunderstanding of
the nature of that vast work.  The occasional humor in the
legendary material, bubbling up in exaggeration and unrestrained
word-play, was hopelessly lost on those who had
no taste for it.  The well-known jocular account (ultimately of
talmudic origin) that inflates the number of plagues suffered
by the Egyptians from the Biblical ten to fifty and ultimately
to two hundred and fifty is a good illustration of the playful
treatment of an episode from tradition or history.  What is lost
is the humanity of a similar legend dealing with the same
episode which represents the angels ringed around the throne
of God singing songs of victory at the discomfiture of the pursuing
hosts and elicting a divine rebuke for their insensitivity
to the sufferings of drowning men and beasts: &ldquo;The work of
my hands perish in the sea and ye dare sing songs of joy!&rdquo;

Nevertheless, the lack of perception of those who believed
that stories of this kind constitute a fair sample of the contents
of the Talmud is remarkable.  A present-day non-Jewish
scholar is aware of this fact when in the course of comment on
a talmudic passage where &ldquo;a veil of word-play&rdquo; covers the
seriousness of the matter under consideration he comments
that the humor involved is of the kind which &ldquo;delights the aggadist
and is the despair of the Gentile who does not see it
from the aggadic point of view.&rdquo;[^a2] It remained for the German poet Heinrich Heine, himself a baptized Jew, to suggest a different perspective when he compared the Talmud to a Gothic cathedral, which &ldquo;though overloaded with childish and grotesque ornaments, yet amazes one with its heavensoaring splendor.&rdquo;

Other, more sinister overtones crept into the word: the
idea that the Talmud is somehow connected with sorcery and
witchcraft and, above all, that it is the ultimate origin of
anti-Christian teaching.  Sir Thomas More, for example, was
convinced that a book of the Talmud had been set up to
&ldquo;destroy the sense of scripture.&rdquo;  The critic and author of an
Elizabethan manual of poetry, George Puttenham, warns
against the &ldquo;malicious and crafty constructions of the
talmudists.&rdquo;  Cotgrave's French-English dictionary (1650)
dismisses the Talmud as a &ldquo;superstitious and blasphemous
book&rdquo; designed by the rabbis, apparently to destroy the faith.
A popular writer puts it in the same class as books on magic
and palmistry and warns his readers to have nothing to do
with any of them.  These ideas, which reflect the ignorance
and prejudice of the Middle Ages, played a tragic role in the
banning and confiscation of Hebrew books and the ultimate
destruction of cartloads of them in Paris, Rome, Venice, and
elsewhere.  But this matter is really a chapter by itself and
belongs to the history of the Talmud as a work, not to the
history of the word in literature.

One would imagine that with the greater knowledge of
the contents of the Talmud available in the nineteenth century
as the result of translations into European languages, the
old connotations of the word would fade away.  Unfortunately,
a prejudicial &ldquo;lag&rdquo; of sorts prevails and the negative image
of the word continues to haunt it.  The supplement to the *Oxford
English Dictionary* even yields an additional form
*talmudization*, and the two illustrative quotations it gives,
both from the twentieth century, do not add luster to its
meaning.  Nevertheless, the idea that the Talmud is a vast
compendium of law, philosophy, ethics, and tradition is
generally recognized, and the use of the term in that sense is
common.  But the word does frequently carry with it an intimation
of legalism, literal-mindedness, and hair-splitting
argumentation.  The old story of the pound of flesh, says a
contemporary American critic, is &ldquo;a gross, but not pointless
caricature of the legalism of the talmudic mind.&rdquo;[^a3]
Another critic, reviewing a book by Ilya Ehrenburg, calls attention to
the author's &ldquo;wild, talmudic talent for splitting false hair.&rdquo;[^a4] To many the word suggests an interest in the intricate and arcane.
One writer finds an intellectual connection between
cryptographers and talmudic scholars.[^a5]
For others the word seems to imply meticulous thoroughness, a devotion to
minute details, and a sensitiveness to refinements of tone or
meaning.  The compilation of an impressive file and bibliography
on a certain subject calls attention to itself according to
one writer by its &ldquo;talmudic thoroughness.&rdquo;[^a6]
An American humorist describes the members of a theatrical cast debating
&ldquo;like talmudical scholars&rdquo; the validity of certain lines,
musical passages, and dance steps in a play about to be produced.[^a7] 
An art critic believes that museum specialists and art
students of today are the &ldquo;intellectual descendants of
mediaeval scholars and talmudic Jews&rdquo; because their world
revolves around fine nuances and exquisite shadings of meanings.[^a8] 
Another writer, analyzing Saul Bellow's style, finds
that it is at once mandarin and colloquial, talmudic dazzle
[and] a brilliant despairing chat, just this side of harangue.&rdquo;[^a9] 
References to the complexity of the Talmud abound.  An
editorial writer in *The New York Times*, commenting on a
current political problem, says that it &ldquo;sounds almost
talmudical in its complexity.&rdquo;[^a10] 
Sometimes the word &ldquo;rabbinic&rdquo; is used as an obvious substitute for &ldquo;talmudic.&rdquo;  A
Nobel prize winner is characterized as the only scientist really
enjoying the &ldquo;rabbinical complexity&rdquo; of his own papers on the
genetics of bacteria.[^a11] 
Nevertheless, with all of this emphasis on the complexity which the Talmud is said to call to mind,
a contemporary novelist can yet write of the &ldquo;talmudic
simplicity&rdquo; of a certain character's background and life.[^a12] 

A similar uncertainty of meaning appears in another use
of the term.  It is sometimes intended to suggest both a blind
adherence to an idea or theory and at the same time its very
opposite, a hypercritical deviation from it.  The &ldquo;most talmudic&rdquo;
of Freud's followers, we are told, accept his theories
as an important contribution to truth and knowledge.[^a13] 
Yet we read that his critics are labeled talmudic revisionists.
Beginning with the middle of the last century the word came
to be used with increasing frequency as a term of opprobrium
in discussions of socialist philosophy, carrying with it hints of
faulty reasoning and deviousness in action.  Karl Marx sneered
at Ferdinand Lassalle's contribution to German socialism as
examples of &ldquo;talmudic wisdom,&rdquo;[^a14] 
and he pursued him with this epithet to the end of his life.  This label or a variation of it
is still very much alive in contemporary communist polemics.
One recalls the periodic blasts of Stalin against doctrinaire
socialists, whom he denounced as &ldquo;talmudic interpreters&rdquo; of
communist ideology[^a15], 
or the use of the word in the Slansky trial in Czechoslovakia, where the defendant's &ldquo;talmudic
microbes&rdquo; were said to be responsible for his deviation from
Marxist teachings.[^a16] 
The term cropped up again when Khrushchev attacked those who invoked Marxist doctrine to
challenge his own interpretation of it by calling them
&ldquo;talmudists&rdquo; and &ldquo;parrots&rdquo; who had learned by heart phrases
from the early theoreticians and had shown poor judgment in
applying them to the problems of today.[^a17] 

For the Nazis, the world provided a wonderfully Protean
term of abuse, a *Schimpfwort* of unparalleled virtuosity.

It implied anything that was bad or contemptible in
language, literature, art, sciences, philosophy, government,
or for that matter anything else.  Even the creation of new
words from abbreviations, or acronymic formations, like *flak*
or *kapo*, though quite popular in Nazi writings and common
in official use, was called a talmudic device introduced into
the language by insidious subversionists, and the vicious oxymoron
&ldquo;talmudic-bolshevik&rdquo; was applied to anything that
resisted or was likely to resist Nazi domination.[^a18] 

Other meanings of the word appear from time to time in
contemporary journalism, though they are difficult to define
and do not seem to fit into the patterns indicated above.  They
might best be called nonce usages, intended for a particular
occasion with only a remote or vague connection with the
original meaning of the word.  One writer, in the course of a
book review, takes occasion to attack teachers of literature in
provincial universities—&ldquo;embalmers&rdquo; of literature, he calls
them—who at best carry on &ldquo;primitive forms of research&rdquo;
and at worst are &ldquo;smug and snooty talmudists.&rdquo;[^a19] 
What the connection of the epithet here is with the subject is not clear.
In an article by another writer a person is called a &ldquo;talmudic
satyr&rdquo; because he appears in some kind of theatrical entertainment
in the flesh as a pot-bellied academic and as the
&ldquo;professor&rdquo; of what is called a Dionysia Theatre.[^a20] 
The only relevance of the word seems to be that the person thus
described had once studied the Talmud with a doting grandfather
and had acquired some skill in argumentation.

What then can be said of the word and its use in contemporary
writing?  It is certainly more widely used than ever
before, and with this wider use has come a proliferation of
meaning leading to vagueness, inaccuracy, and occasional
contradiction.  As to its emotional overtones, it has certainly
lost much of the contempt which invariably accompanied it
in earlier times and now carries with it an occasional shade of
admiration—except of course in the violent polemical contexts
noted above.  Yet one wonders at times whether the
thrust of its allusiveness is really directed at the work for
which the word is the name or at something quite different.  It
is certainly a strange word, rich in emotion, implying something
peculiar, out of the ordinary, not in harmony with its
environment, impressively alien.  This image is conveyed in
vivid color and tone in Padraic Colum's verses entitled &ldquo;Copper
Beeches.&rdquo;

## Copper Beeches
*Padraic Colum*

Talmudic in their alienness  
The Copper Beeches are beside  
The Willow, Ash and Sycamore—  
Dark, ponderous trees.  

The Willow, Ash and Sycamore  
Profess the green.  And them beside,  
With branches close around dark stems  
And leaves like burnished metal, dark—  
Unordained trees.  

Alien as minds that pondered on  
The letters twelve and forty-two,  
And in their inner depths pronounced  
The name that's figured in the great  
Tetragrammaton.  

The Copper Beeches spread beside  
The Willow, Ash and Sycamore,  
Alien, but more—discordant they—  
Discordant as the metal clang  
Against the lutes, the flutes, the chimes—  
Dark ponderous trees!


### OBITER DICTA: *War Against whynot*
*Alfred Alexander, London, England*

I was brought up with great respect for the proper use of
words and this urged me to fight *whynot* since I faced it for
the first time.  It was at the end of the last war.  A friend, an
American serviceman, said &ldquo;Why don't you come over tonight
and have a drink with us?&rdquo;  I thought, &ldquo;Isn't it odd that
I should be asked to give my reasons for *not* doing something
which I would enjoy doing?&rdquo;  I hesitated to answer, and eventually
muttered &ldquo;Yes, I'd very much like to come.&rdquo;

The monstrous habit of saying &ldquo;Why don't you?&rdquo;  when
you mean &ldquo;Would you care to?&rdquo;  began, I believe, in the
United States.  It spread like wildfire and its anti-syntactical
doctrine still flourishes.

*Whynot* is in fashion and in power, dominates the newspapers
and abounds on television.  Only the guerilla tactics of
unexpected attack offer any chance against it.  The proper
weapon is the anti-*whynot* bomb, a verbal Molotov cocktail,
which you mix yourself and hurl with pretended innocence at
the offender.

If, for argument's sake, you are assailed with &ldquo;Why don't
you come with me on Sunday to see Charles?&rdquo;  you answer: &ldquo;Because
I promised to take Maggie to her aunt in Eastbourne.&rdquo;

You can load your charge with different explosives: &ldquo;Why
not come and have dinner with us on Tuesday night?&rdquo;  can, in
hostile fashion, be countered by &ldquo;Because I've had poor
reports of your cooking,&rdquo; but it is more tactful to say: &ldquo;Because
I promised to take Betty to the theatre.&rdquo;  The society
doctor who likes to tempt his patients with &ldquo;Why not go for a
cruise to cure your cough?&rdquo;  is best given the antidote &ldquo;Because
I simply cannot afford it, Doctor.&rdquo;

With the right mixture and correct aim every *whynot*
can be blown to pieces.  Let everyone with the will to fight
take heart: our position, though difficult, is not hopeless.  Every
hit demoralises the opponent.

## The Arabic Star-Names
*E.E. Rehmus, San Francisco, California*

Although even a little history should serve to remind us
that it was the Arabs who, in the Middle Ages, reintroduced
astronomy into European culture, still many of us may
have wondered why so *many* of the brightest stars have
Arabic names.  The Mohammedan contribution to astronomy
was actually much less remarkable than their contribution to
arithmetic.  They called astrology '*ilm ahq&amacr;m* (or *sina '&amacr;t*) *al
nudj&umacr;m, 'science of the decrees of the stars' and astronomy
'ilm al hai'a*, or 'science of the aspects (of the universe).'  But
they made little real distinction between an astronomer
(*falak&imacr;*) and an astrologer (*munadjdjim*).  Indeed, it is to the
unlettered Bedouins, as you might suspect, that we look for
the names themselves—to those desert nomads who traveled
by night over the trackless sands on their &ldquo;ships of the desert&rdquo;
and who observed the comparative positions of the moon to
28 different groups of stars called the 'lunary stations'
(*man&amacr;zil alqamar*).

During the Dark Ages, at a time when such lore had elsewhere
sunk into oblivion, however, they did manage to preserve
the earlier progress of the Greeks.  And the great number
of names that the Arabs gave to the stars shows us how
thorough in astronomical observation they must have been.
The Greeks had, as a matter of fact, either missed altogether
or simply not bothered to list a number of bright stars easily
visible to the naked eye.  We should remember, too, that during
the Dark Ages the Arabs were capable of making quite accurate
projections of such esoterica as the circumference of
the earth.  During that same era, the European astronomers
were lucky to be able to make accurate predictions for the
dates of religious holidays.  And although astronomy is said to
have begun with the Greeks, undoubtedly still other Semites
preceded them.  *Kochab*, for instance, found in Ursa Minor, is
certainly the Phoenician word quite simply for 'star.'

What is interesting to us, then, about the ancients is their
*manner* of seeing.  The Greeks apparently saw the stars simply as
patterns, that is, as *constellations*.  The Arabs, on the other hand,
focused their attention on the individual stars themselves.

The oldest extant star catalogue is the *Almagest* of
Ptolemy (137 A.D.).  It was replaced by an Arabian catalogue
in the 15th century.  Many abortive attempts were made by
the Europeans to replace the pagan Greek and—to the Europeans—the
barbarous-sounding Semitic star names with more
modern ones.  The best-documented of these was that of Juluius
Schiller (1627).  In his *Coelum Stellatum Christianum* ('The
Christian Stars of Heaven') he made a zealous effort to replace
all the fascinating old names with the tiresome names of
popes, bishops, saints, and the like.  That he failed utterly is
testimony to the innate good sense of the human race, which
obviously prefers that the stars retain their ancient mystery
and romance and not be dragged down to the level of commonplace
Church dignitaries.

But aside from a few Latin names: *Sirius* 'the dog star'
(*Sothis* of Ancient Egypt); *Regulus* 'the little king'; *Foramen*
'the opening'; *Manubrium* 'a handle'—and others from Greek
mythology, such as *Alcyone* in the Pleiades, etc.—an amazing
number of the most common stars retain their old Arabic
names.  What, then do they all mean?  Good question—and
one not so easy to answer as one might think.  There are few
reference works that can supply us with everything we want.

For the benefit of the reader's curiosity, here are a few
origins that are known by Arab scholars, plus a couple of
guesses (indicated by question marks).  The reason that
guesses should sometimes be necessary at all owes itself to the
fact that transliterating from the Arabic writing often obscures
the original words.  For example, the star *Algol*, which is
located in Taurus, is given in many dictionaries as descending
from *al-gh&amacr;la*, 'the destroyer,' but its more likely origin is the
more familiar form from the same root: *ghul* 'a woodland
demon' from which we got our word *ghoul*, 'a defiler of
graves.'  The Egyptians themselves, of course, were the first to
break into the ancient tombs to seek their pharaonic treasures,
but the Arabs did their share of such grave-robbing, too,
we have been told.  Most of the names given here, however,
are accepted with little question by historians.

>*Achernar* 'Last fire.'
>
>*Aldebaran* (*Al-dabar&amacr;n* is from *dabar* 'to follow'
because it follows upon the Pleiades.)  A star in the
constellation of Taurus (*Th&umacr;ru* in Arabic) means 'the
one who is more easily led' or 'The Follower,' referring
to one of a team of oxen.  The -*an* ending here
apparently does not indicate the accusative, but
rather the dual, as in a pair.

>*Adhafera* 'The one who holds out' or 'The
Victorious.'
>
>*Algenubi* 'The Southerner.'
>

>
>*Alioth* (*Alyat*) 'fat tail of a sheep.'
>
>*Al Jabhah* 'The Front' or 'Forehead.'
>
>*Almach* 'The Brain.'
>

'Tail of the Hen.'

## Again and Ageyn and Agane
*W.R. Edwards, Chesham, England*

There seems to be a modern dogma that this word must
always be pronounced AGEN, even when poets rhyme to such
words as *plain, slain, rain*.  Am I alone in objecting to some
trained speaker deliberately breaking a rhyme, as if to show
that he or she knows better than Chaucer, Shakespeare, and
Donne?

It is quite clear that the word, in ordinary speech, may
be pronounced AGANE or AGEN.  With one exception, every
dictionary I have consulted gives both pronunciations.  The
exception is a recent edition of *Cassell's New English Dictionary*,
which gives only A'GAN.

The word is of Anglo-Saxon origin, two spellings being
given in the *OED*: *ongean* and *ongaegn*.  The latter is
recognizable in the modern German *entgegen* 'against, contrary
to, towards,' and in fact the word, in its earlier usages,
was both a preposition and an adverb, with several meanings,
including 'again, against, towards and in return.'  This
last is still found occasionally, as in A.E. Housman:

>Ah, let not only mine be vain,  
For lovers should be loved again.

And I am certain that that great precisionist intended a true
rhyme and did not reckon on being &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; by some radio
elocutionist.

Amongst the spellings recorded in dictionaries are:
*again, againe, agayn, agayne, agein, ageyn, agane* and *agen*.
Only the last seems to offer any support to the modern
dogma, unless the pronunciation of the other spellings has
changed over the centuries.  What evidence have we as to how
a word was pronounced in the past?  It seems to me that
rhyme is the strongest evidence, if the spelling cannot be accepted.
Let us see how poets, from the beginning of English
rhyme, have chosen to rhyme *again*.  (With the earliest examples,
the rhyming word and the spelling are given.)

It will be seen that, in my random browsing, I have
found no example of a *men, pen* rhyme earlier that Chapman
and Ben Jonson, and it is highly significant that Jonson spells
the word according to the rhyme: *vaine/again, men/agen*.
Francis Quarles also spells it *agen* to rhyme with *when*.

Ben Jonson is the earliest of the small number of poets
who sometimes use *rain/pain* rhymes and sometimes *men/pen*
rhymes.  The proportion of the latter increases in the 19th century,
and it may be that the dogma dates from then.  But
why?  It is inconceivable that the vast majority of poets were
using false rhymes.  It is equally incredible that all the rhymed
words have changed their pronunciation.  Who could argue
that *fain* was ever pronounced as *fen, pain* as *pen, ta'en* as
*ten*, or *main* as *men*?  (Chaucer rhymes *men* with *hen*).

My own conclusion is that *again* was pronounced AGANE
in common speech, as in verse, by the majority of English-speaking
people over the centuries.  In every case the apparent
intention of the poet should be respected when speaking his
verse, varying the pronunciation according to the rhyme.

## B-P Words
*Malcolm Wells, Brewster, Massachusetts*

[Editor's Note: *One of the more interesting features of a language
is its patterns.  All of us are familiar with paradigms in
English and we know about the paradigms for the French &ldquo;irregular&rdquo;
verbs, German nouns, adjectives, and verbs, and the
reflexes in most other inflecting languages.  In the past*, VERBATIM
*has published articles on binomial, trinomial, and
other varieties of semantic, euphonic, alliterative, and syntactic
patterning, but as far as I know, no study has been offered
of patterns of initial sounds or letters.  It is unlikely that
the list given below is complete.  But how many other such
lists can be made for English?  Readers are not encouraged to
send addenda to* VERBATIM: *please send contributions to the
author at P.O. Box 1149, Brewster, MA 02631*.  VERBATIM
*will, however, entertain comments and observations*.

ONE OF THE MOST provocative questions ever aired on
television was asked a few years ago by British Petroleum:
&ldquo;What's a B-P?&rdquo;~~~~

I never heard whether or not the corporation got its
answer, but I for one, having been forced to face the B-P issue
for the first time, decided to find out for myself.

It wasn't easy.  And I never dreamed that the Great American
Novel itself would lie among the lists of words I'd soon
compile.  Nor did I ever dare to hope my friends and correspondents
would offer so much help.

Just the other day, for instance, the editor of one of the
country's leading newspapers phoned me and said, &ldquo;Malcolm?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Brillo.&rdquo;  (click) Thus had yet another B-P addict been
hooked by these simple rules: find a pair of B-P words or syllables
so comfortably familiar that only the B need be spoken
to suggest the P.

### ETYMOLOGICA OBSCURA
*Kenneth A. MacFadyen, Kearny, New Jersey*

I would like to suggest the origins of two words that my
dictionaries list as &ldquo;origin unknown.&rdquo;  The first of these is
&ldquo;jalopy&rdquo; for an old automobile.  I am sure this is based upon
an old joke that I used to hear as a child.  Men would say of an
old horse: &ldquo;The only way you'll get that horse to run is to give
it jalap (a common horse laxative),&rdquo; meaning of course that
its bowels would run.  Extending it to old cars is natural.

The other word is &ldquo;monadnock.&rdquo;  One dictionary says
&ldquo;American Indian,&rdquo; another says &ldquo;after Mt. Monadnock in
N.H.&rdquo;  My Gaelic dictionary gives *monadh* as 'mountain;
moor' and *cnoc* as 'hill' and I feel that the occurrence of both
roots in the one word is not mere coincidence.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: *The Book of Names* 
The Southern New England Telephone Company, (Southern New England Telephone Company, Publisher, New Haven, 1969-1978), 995pp., gratis.

In preparing a recent manuscript of mine, I ran across a
most interesting volume and superb resource directory dedicated
exclusively to names—*The Book of Names*.  Since the
book, now in its ninth edition, has never been reviewed formally,
I wish to make it known to the readers of VERBATIM,
particularly those whose interests are in the areas of etymology
and onomastics.  The major purpose of this annually revised
publication is to facilitate communication among people.
To help fulfill this purpose the editors have tried &ldquo;... to humanize
what is generally regarded as a very stereotyped and
uninteresting collection of materials [people's names].

With names arranged in alphabetical order, this huge
volume presents name material from several different perspectives,
all of linguistic and social historic interest.  One perspective
is to provide information regarding name derivations,
giving brief explanations about the origins of family
names.  For example, we learn that *Cain* and *Kane* share
common origins, that *Fitzpatrick* is said to be the Anglicized
form of *Giolla-Phadruic*, the name of an ancient Irish chief of
the Tenth Century, with the literal meaning 'the servant of
St. Patrick,' and that *Hoffman* is an old German name which
refers to one who worked on a large farm, whether as owner
or manager.

Another perspective is on any given page of the book to
offer biographical sketches of famous people who have one of
the names on that page.  In this regard, we read that Gail *Borden*
(1801-1874) erected the first condensed milk factory in
the world in 1856; that Samuel *Colt* (1814-1862) invented a
revolver; and that Charles *Goodyear* (1800-1860) in 1839 accidentally
discovered the process for the vulcanization of rubber.
Similarly, we learn more about such other famous people
as *Samuel Clemens, Nathan Hale, Harriet Beecher Stowe*,
and *Eli Whitney*.

In addition to the above offerings, the book summarizes
the accomplishments of many famous Connecticut residents,
past and present.  For example, we read about *Mary Adam*
(1689-1803) who lived in three different centuries; about
*P.T. Barnum* (1810-1891) who started out as a storekeeper
and ran a weekly paper in Danbury, Connecticut; about *Edward
A. Bouchet* (1852-1918) who was the first black person
to receive the Ph.D. degree from Yale University; and about
*joe Currie*, known for his big black cigars, who was a New
England featherweight champion never knocked out in 345
fights.

Finally, the book includes a focus on Connecticut place
names and how they originated.  For exampe, *Dumpling
Pond*, in the town of Greenwich, has a rich history.  When the
British raided this section in 1779, they stopped at a gristmill
and invited themselves to a meal of dumplings which the miller's
wife chanced to be making.  Taking advantage of a lapse in
their attention, she threw the dumplings into the mill pond, an
act that is commemorated in the name.

Readers of this book also are encouraged to enjoy any of
several name games, suggested on the inside covers, such as
the finding of famous namesakes in the book.

The volume is published throughout the state of Connecticut
in several different versions, in accordance with the
needs and interests of the people of each area it is intended to
serve.  Its popularity is reflected in the fact that each of the
first nine editions has been owned by more than three million
readers in Connecticut alone.  It has great practical value for
everyone and is the kind of work which ought to be in every
home.

To Connecticut residents this book is easily recognized
and is widely known as *The Book of Names*.  To most of the
rest of us, it is known as our telephone directory.  To my
knowledge, it is the only telephone directory in the world
which has been named and published in this manner.  Although
most of the above kinds of information sections were
recently discontinued, the directory's name remains unchanged
and is worth noting if only for its uniqueness in an
area of our day-to-day lives which generally is deemed uninteresting.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: *A Gardener's Dictionary Of Plant Names*
A. W. Smith, rev. and enlarged by William T. Stearn with J.
L.L. Smith, (St. Martin's Press, 1972), xii + 391pp.

Stearn's credentials are impeccable: he is a botanist of
the Natural History section of the British Museum, a doctor of
science, a Fellow of the Linnaean Society, and author of the
highly informative volume *Botanical Latin*.  In revising the
earlier work of A. W. Smith (a highly informed amateur), he
was forced to be excruciatingly selective, for, since Linnaeus
began the systematic description of plants in the 18th century,
botanical nomenclature has expanded so drastically that
its vocabulary includes more than a half-million items, half of
them concerning the flowering plants gardeners attempt to
raise.  (This word list is so vast that not even *Hortus III* attempts
to contain it all.) Dr. Stearn's solution is elegant: he
has chosen almost 6000 terms basic to even the most enterprising
gardener, providing necessary etymologies and extremely
clear but simple explanations.  To aid a gardener new to the
intricacies of botanical terminology, he has provided a remarkably
clear but brief introduction explaining the necessity
for a single international term for each plant family, genus,
and species; in addition, he has classified the modes of plant-name
origins beginning with those from pre-Christian
Greece, illustrated the procedures involved in using binomial
nomenclature, and added a brief grammar and syntax relating
to the *International Code of Botanical Nomenclature*.  His
word list is so complete that a gardener meeting an unfamiliar
botanical name (say, *Maclura pomifera*) can readily learn
that it refers to a species of Osage orange (named after the
American geologist William Maclure) that bears fruit as well
as flowers.

The botanical-to-common section of the book, occupying
the first 336 pages, is followed by a highly praiseworthy
&ldquo;Introduction to Vernacular Names,&rdquo; a selective bibliography,
and an index of 3000 vernacular names and botanical
counterparts in parallel columns.

At this point, the usefulness of the volume declines precipitately
for the American.  Smith was an Englishman transplanted
to American, and his experience was chiefly British;
Stearn is also English.  As a result, the vernacular names are
almost exclusively British.  The fault is probably Stearn's; as a
professional botanist, he cannot be expected to be at home in
vernacular nomenclature.

Unfortunately, his list is not entirely useful even for
British common names.  Case in point: the genus *Impatiens*
contains at least three species, all grown in both Britain and
USA: *Impatiens noli-tangere*, known commonly in England
and America as balsam and touch-me-not; *Impatiens sultana*
and *Impatiens holstii*, known in England as dizzy Lizzy or
busy Lizzie and in America (erroneously) as patient Lucy and
patience.  In both countries it is also referred to correctly as
impatience and impatiens.  The Smith/Stearn/Smith volume
lists the first but omits balsam from the vernacular list.  It does
not mention the second and third species either botanically or
vernacularly, despite their very strong popularity on both sides
of the Atlantic.  Ditto for *Schlumbergera truncata* (Thanksgiving
cactus), *Plectranthus australis* (Swedish ivy), *Senecio
mikanioides* (German ivy), etc.

If this analysis of the Smith/Stearn/Smith volume has a
moral, it is this: publishers should not merely add a gardening
title to their lists.  St. Martin's should realize, despite their
English origins, that a book by an English botanist specifically
stating that the volume &ldquo;includes most of the genera...
being cultivated in the British Isles, Germany, the Netherlands,
and Scandinavia&rdquo; is hardly a book for most American
gardeners.

Thus, until the first three parts of the Smith/Stearn/Smith
volume are edited and reprinted with a thoroughly overhauled
vernacular section, most avid American gardeners
must still unhappily await the ideal botanical-to-common
dictionary.

## Defile Your Records!

When one has been editing dictionaries for as long as I
have, a condition of paranomastic fatigue sets in, and, as far
as I know, there is no cure for it.  It happens in many editorial
offices: someone comes up with a weird sort of joke that has
occurred to him while his mind was wandering through the
organization of the materials he was working with.  The next
thing you know, the joke has become systematized into a
game, and the entire staff—all language-oriented—is playing
it.  One such game was played at *Newsweek* in the mid-1940s,
when I was employed there for a while in a capacity that I
have tried to forget and that *Newsweek* has probably consigned
to the dustbin.  It consisted of translating popular English
songs (literally) into French and German.  &ldquo;Ich werde dich
warden in einem Taxi, Honig,&rdquo; was originally &ldquo;I'll be down
to get you in a taxi, Honey,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y avait un gars.  Un gars
qui &eacute;tait tout bizarre&rdquo; had been &ldquo;There was a boy, A very
strange, enchanted boy.&rdquo;  Since some of those songs had actually
been translated for consumption abroad.  I cannot any
longer be certain which were our translations and which the
&ldquo;official&rdquo; ones.  But they were a lot of fun.  The best collection
I know of that treats a wide range of such translations is *The
Astonishment of Words*, by Victor Proetz, which is one of the
first and most popular books offered through the VERBATIM
Book Club.

Other games—if they can be elevated to that status—
abound: in VERBATIM [III,4] we featured a solitaire version
described by Walter Kidney in &ldquo;The Seating of Zotz.&rdquo;  One
game focused on collecting bloopers made by fellow editors.
*The American College Dictionary*, for example, defines *yoheave-ho*
as, a cry that sailors give when heaving together.
One editor on *The Random House Dictionary* (Unabridged),
assigned to writing definitions of idioms and to the contrivance
of example contexts had great difficulty in keeping the
literal separated from the metaphoric.  For get in on the ground
floor, she gave the example, *He heard they were building a new
factory in the area and wanted to get in on the ground floor;* for
last straw, the example was *The service in this restaurant has
been bad before, but this is the last straw*; and for give someone
his head she wrote. *She wanted to go to college out of town, so
her parents gave her her head*.  If you were writing that stuff all
day long, week in, week out, for months on end you might do
worse.  I imagine that Tom Swifties were invented in just such
an atmosphere.

One of my favorites, though, was one of my own invention,
and everyone is invited to play.  It's absurdly simple: If
clergymen are unfrocked and lawyers are disbarred, how are
members of these trades and professions to be got rid of?  A few

## Philip Howard on English English
*Philip Howard*

Little Englishers, stick-in-the-muds, and snobs grumble
about American linguistic imperialism.  They are foolish to do
so.  The United States are the linguistic melting-pot of our
age.  Most new English flows eastwards across the Atlantic,
partly because so many people are speaking and writing the
stuff over there, and partly because so much innovatory work
that needs new jargon to describe it is done over there.  American
English is the principal source of new life for the language.
It is not surprising that a certain amount of linguistic
scum comes to the top of the pot that refines the bright new
metals of slang, jargon, and other accretions to English.  But
of all languages English is a functional organism.  If there is a
need for the new English, it establishes itself.  Slang and
jargon that are merely fashionable cottonwool words rapidly
become boring and fade away.  Not many unnecessary Americanisms
have established themselves.  My learned and fastidious
chief revise sub-editor asserts that the American word
(and possibly also the virtue) of *know-how* are otiose as well
as ugly.  I am not persuaded that there is another way of saying
precisely *know-how*.

Instead of grumbling about new Americanisms that time
will prove to be either ephemeral or useful, for a change let us
call for a new word that neither American nor British English
has yet invented.  We desperately need a word to mean 'people
who are living together but not married.'  The Social Services
Correspondent of *The Times* (of London, which Americans
will describe erroneously as *The London Times*) has attempted
to introduce *cohabitee*, which is ugly as well as irregularly
formed.  The regular *cohabitant* is still a mouthful.  Perhaps it
might pass in written bureaucratese, but not in conversation:
&ldquo;Can I introduce you to my *cohabitant?*&rdquo;

The Department of Health and Social Security has begun
to recognize this linguistic deficiency.  In its latest circular
on the Cohabitation Rule it settles for 'those living together as
man and wife.'  Extreme feminists object to this on the grounds
that it should be either 'husband and wife' or 'man and
woman'; and anyway, that it omits the possibility of homosexual
partners, triolism, and other arrangements.

*Friend, boy-friend*, and *girl-friend* all deserve thumbs
down for being intolerably coy euphemisms and for muddying
the established meanings of those words.  *Consort* is stuffy
and has a ring of royalty in the United Kingdom.  *Lover* and
*mistress*, though fine words, do not convey that anybody is
living with anybody else: on the contrary, they have connotations
of romantic clandestinity.  *Leman* is both arch and archaic.
The French are starting to use *compagnon* for this
meaning.  But that is a genteel euphemism, and *companion*
already has a useful meaning.  At present the most straightforward
way of describing the relationship is to say: &ldquo;We live together.&rdquo;
We need a new noun for contexts where a clause will
not fit.  Is there an obsolete name for the partner of a clandestine
marriage from the Middle Ages?  If there were, could we
revive it?  It would be more sensible and more probable for
the United States, our richest source of new English and new
social customs, to bubble up a suitable new word for our tied
tongues.

Allen Walker Read, Professor Emeritus of English, Columbia
University, has reached into his extraordinary files—made
the more so by virtue of his knowing everything that is in
them—to extract the following by way of response and further
illumination of &ldquo;You know what I mean...&rdquo; [V, 2].  It
appeared in *American Scholar*, xix (Spring, 1950), 239, in
&ldquo;Under Whatever Sky,&rdquo; a regular department written by Erwin
Edman, Professor of Philosophy, Columbia University.
Its title is &ldquo;You Know What I Mean?,&rdquo;  (which, for this editor's
edification, ought to be subtitled, &ldquo;There is nothing new
under the sun&rdquo;).

>It has become a familiar locution in colloquial New
York speech, especially among the not very literate,
after the most obvious sentence, to add &ldquo;You know
what I mean?&rdquo;  with a wistful, rising inflection implying
that between &ldquo;buddies,&rdquo; in the common brotherhood
of men, among men who know their way
around, explanations are unnecessary—and impossible.
Thus, I have heard a taxi driver say, &ldquo;I was just walking
down the street; you know what I mean?  I was going
home and was going to stop for something to eat;
you know what I mean?&rdquo;  ...Is it perhaps a shrewd
suspicion on the part of those not accustomed to
elaborate speech that even the simplest experience can
somehow not be communicated, and that even walking
down the street or stopping for something to eat is not
quite explicable or communicable in its fullness?


#### EPISTOLA {Richard Condon}

I suppose that even an octogenarian who has devoted,
and continues to devote, his life to the exploration of the most
fascinating by-ways of the English language cannot expect to
be immune from adverse criticism, but I found your review of
Eric Partridge's *Dictionary of Catch Phrases* unduly harsh.  It
gave little indication of the fun to be found between its
covers.

Is his failure to give a snappy definition of a catch phrase
really &ldquo;vagueness?&rdquo;  For me he at least makes it clear what
kind of thing he means by this elusive phrase; and surely
anyone's selection would look arbitrary to others, especially if
it relied partly on information volunteered by those interested
and helpful enough to correspond with the author.

I should like to comment on some of your specific complaints.
Partridge does not say that &ldquo;after you my dear
Alphonse, etc.&rdquo; is Canadian dating from 1959, merely that a
Canadian contact told him in 1959 that the c.p. was used in
Canada.  Even if the phrase is much older, your &ldquo;distinct impression&rdquo;
of its U.S. origin is hardly proof.  More generally,
your claims for the American origin of various phrases may or
may not be true; my main conclusion is that more Americans
should write to Partridge.

You may not consider &ldquo;pop goes the weasel&rdquo; very
English.  The fact remains that it is the last line of a nursery
rhyme known to every English child containing specific
references to places in London, with all respect to Arthur
Fiedler.  As for &ldquo;Polly put the kettle on,&rdquo; the nursery rhyme is
still current, but the catch phrase is surely obsolescent or even
obsolete.  Having lived in England for 34 years (until last
year) I have *never* heard &ldquo;I'll be Polly,&rdquo; and as the father of a
daughter called Polly I think I should have noticed it.  Either
you know some odd Britons, or you are mis-remembering the
common &ldquo;I'll be mother,&rdquo; omitted by Partridge but said
when pouring tea.

It must be hard to write such a book as this without appearing
idiosyncratic and eclectic, and even the friendliest reviewers
have complained about omissions that seemed important
to them.  No doubt Partridge will take account of this and
of any correspondence if and when he prepares a second edition.
The fact remains that the apparently immortal author
of the undeniably immortal *Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional
English* continues to delight his readers.  He tries
very hard not to be parochial (is it fair to ask that a book written
in Britain should label &ldquo;Briticisms&rdquo; as well as Americanisms?
would you expect an American author to label Americanisms?)
and if he sometimes fails to be omniscient, let us
hope that American (and other) readers will be tempted to
help.

#### EPISTOLA {Tom Bagnal}

In response to Mr. Geoffrey Bocca's piece [V, 1], it may
have escaped Mr. Bocca's attention that the sign reading &ldquo;No
Dogs Allowed&rdquo; actually grants permission for dogs to congregate
in the Post Office building.  If one does not have a dog, it
is allowed.  The same is true of signs reading &ldquo;No Smoking
Allowed.&rdquo;  It is not smoking that is disallowed; it is no smoking
that is allowed.

#### EPISTOLA {Donald Hawes}

At the risk of seeming over-pedantic, I must point out
that the &ldquo;binomial phrases&rdquo; which Philip E. Hager lists so
abundantly in VERBATIM [IV, 4] are not examples of hendiadys,
as he implies.  The definition in the *Oxford English
Dictionary* indicates that a typical form of hendiadys is the
&ldquo;use of two substantives with *and* instead of an adjective and
substantive.&rdquo;  Therefore, as Fowler's *Modern English Usage*
(revised edition, 1965) makes clear, one constituent of an hendiadys
is subordinate to the other.  Fowler's examples include
*nice and warm, try and do better*, and *grace and favour*,
which can be used instead of *nicely warm, try to do better*
and *gracious favour*.  On the other hand, phrases excluded by
Fowler from this figure of speech include *assault and battery,
might and main, toil and moil*, and *spick and span*, all of
which appear in Mr. Hager's list.  The term &ldquo;Siamese twins&rdquo;
used in *Modern English Usage* is not, however, a happy one.
Admittedly, some of the components of such phrases are indivisible
(e.g., *bits and pieces, on and on*), but others can be decisively
separated (e.g., *flotsam and jetsam, thick and thin*).
Probably &ldquo;binomial phrases&rdquo; is the best description, despite
mathematical connotations.

The article on &ldquo;Siamese twins&rdquo; in *Modern English Usage*
mentions the *Book of Common Prayer*.  One of its most prominent
stylistic features is the use of phrases consisting of two
synonyms (usually nouns or verbs).  Here are examples taken
from three parts of the *Book*: the Order for Morning Prayer,
the Order for Evening Prayer, and the Order of the Ministration
of the Holy Communion.

>*sins and wickedness; dissemble and cloke; assemble
and meet together; requisite and necessary; pray and
beseech; erred and strayed; declare and pronounce;
pardoneth and absolveth; vanquish and overcome; joy
and felicity; desires and petitions; acknowledge and
confess; rest and quietness; perils and dangers;
everlasting and infinite; rule and governance; dispose
and turn; prayers and supplications; rightly and duly;
comfort and succour; religiously and devoutly; food
and sustenance; search and examine; [make] restitution
and satisfaction; injuries and wrongs; counsel and advice;
scruple and doubtfulness; try and examine; confirm
and strengthen; offer and present*.

There is a brief but searching discussion of this feature of
the *Book of Common Prayer* in C.S. Lewis's *English Literature
in the Sixteenth Century* (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
1954), pp. 217-218.  Lewis writes that &ldquo;it has sometimes been
supposed that the second word is added in order to explain
the first to the unlearned, but this is a mistake.  Sixteenth-century
writers (including Cranmer himself in his *Homilies*) do
sometimes add synonyms for this utilitarian purpose, but
much more often they add them to adorn their style....  To
ring the changes, *wordum wrixlan*, was as natural a delight
to the men of that age as it had been to Virgil or the Anglo-Saxon
*scop*.&rdquo;  Whatever the origin and purpose of the device,
it certainly makes the prayers memorable, emphatic, and rhythmical—qualities
essential for successful participation by the
congregation in a religious service.  It also demonstrates the
rich resources of vocabulary in sixteenth-century English,
sometimes making use in parallel of words derived from
Latin and Anglo-Saxon roots, as in *assemble and meet together,
rightly and duly*, and *food and sustenance*.

#### EPISTOLA {Marvin Grosswirth}

Geoffrey Bocca's article, &ldquo;If It Isn't In Writing...&rdquo; [V, 1]
was amusing, interesting, and I am afraid, a trifle biased.  It
may be that we become so accustomed to our native signs that
we fail to recognize them as being particularly unusual.  Still,
some of my favorite recollections of signs are British in origin.

It has been several years since I have been to England,
but I still remember the posters embellishing every store-front
office of the British School of Motoring: &ldquo;Good driving begins
and ends here.&rdquo;  Nor can I forget the neatly hand-lettered sign
in front of a lumber yard near the railway station in St. Albans:
&ldquo;When purchasing our fences, be sure to enquire about our
erection service.&rdquo;

As for official public notices, I would not have believed
that New York could outdo London.  Unfortunately, I cannot
remember the precise wording of the London signs warning
dogowners to watch their pet's excretory habits.  I do know
that in New York, such signs say, simply: &ldquo;Curb your dog.&rdquo;
In London, the signs carry a short essay about &ldquo;persons in
charge of animals that befoul the footway,&rdquo; etc.  The doors in
New York subway cars carry the simple admonition: &ldquo;Please
keep hands off doors,&rdquo; while the London Underground doors
bear (or, if things have changed, bore) a legend about not interfering
with the safe operation of the train.  (In Paris, as I
recall, the Metro cautions passengers not to interfere with the
doors at the risk of dying.)

On a prophylactics vending machine in the Gents' in a
London pub was a sign reading: &ldquo;Manufactured in accordance
with British Standards,&rdquo; under which someone scrawled: &ldquo;So
was the Titanic.&rdquo;

I must confess, however, that my two favorite signs do
appear in New York.  A midtown taxidermist has a sign in his
window reading: &ldquo;Glass eyes for every occasion,&rdquo; and a Madison
Avenue costume jewelry shop announces: &ldquo;Ears pierced while
you wait.&rdquo;

And then there are the little signs all over Amsterdam
promoting a product called &ldquo;Superglans.&rdquo;  It is, I am told, an
automotive product.  Still, wouldn't it be nice if it were....
Well, never mind.

#### EPISTOLA {Penn Melnick}

I recently found myself at a gathering of New York City
school teachers and administrators.  Not being in the field
myself, I could sit back and listen to the conversation going
on around me.  I believe I heard a new use for an old word:
&ldquo;to grieve someone&rdquo; in the active sense, meaning to cause a
grievance to be filed against one's supervisor.  It is used principally
in discussing Union procedures.

I took the trouble of checking with other teachers in the
New York City system and found that this was an accepted
use of this word.

#### EPISTOLA {Maxey Brooke}

I am pleased to see that Mr. Price has seen fit to bring the
sordid *f* situation into the open.  It is high time the whole ugly
story be told.

It starts some three thousand years ago when the letters
were invented by the Phoenicians.  Everyone knows this part
of the story, how the arrangement of letters was named &ldquo;alphabet&rdquo;
after the first two letters *aleph*, 'ox' and *beth*, 'house.'

Less well known is that to the north, another letter arrangement
was used by the inventors of the runes.  The first
three letters were *f* for *feoh*, 'money'; *u* for *ur*, 'aurochs'; and
&thorn; for 'thorh.'  Hence the letter collection was known as *futhark,
futhark, futhorc*, or *futhork*.

As the alphabet moved north and the futhark moved
south, it was inevitable that they meet.  And that meeting was
a violent conflict.  With the full force of the Holy Roman Empire
behind it, the alphabet was an easy winner.  And the alphabet
was a vindictive victor.  It was not content with merely
winning, it tried to utterly destroy futhark.

The net result was that *f* was relegated to the inferior position
described by Mr. Price.  If you check, you will find that
*u* is an equally unsavory letter and &thorn; has completely disappeared
as a letter.

sic transit....

Bruce D. Price's &ldquo;A Metalinguistic Inquiry into F&rdquo; [V,1]

unpleasant attributes of many F-beginning words, while discerning
and amusing, was also irritating.  His category of pejorative
F-words seems endless.  No real quarrel with that.
But he has the gall to arbitrarily assign the word *female* and
the characteristic *feminine* to the entire negative syndrome he
projects regarding *F*, with no explanation why *female* doesn't
rate inclusion in his brief list of positive or &ldquo;good&rdquo; F-words.
Well, thanks a lot!

Baloney!  The words *female* and *feminine* are among
those which add grace and balance to the whole batch of
F-words.

Why not a brief *f*oray into M-beginning words?  *F*rankly,
M-words are pretty ho-hum, in the main, with plenty of them
falling into both &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; categories.  But one could
just as arbitrarily assign *male* and *masculine* to a category of
nasty M-beginning words, as he did *female* to his pejorative
list of F-words.

#### EPISTOLA {David B. Guralnik}

In your critique of Kister's *Dictionary Buying Guide*
[V,1], you cite his quotation of something I said in a published
talk of 1953, which was reprinted in toto in 1977.  My
talk, given just after the publication of *WNWD*, was meant
to explain our practices and principles, one of which was at
that time (for better or worse) to supply definitions for all
terms entered and to enter only those terms whose frequency
of occurrence or orthographic irregularity seemed to demand
their inclusion.  (Incidentally, *flavorfully* and *flatterer* have
never appeared as headwords in any of our dictionaries, and I
cannot imagine why you would say they have.)  Since, in
1953, our major competitor had a far lower vocabulary count
than our own—c. 130,000 vs. 142,000—we felt no need to
pad the figure with such entries or run-ins as *mythologization*
or *permeableness*, as in, for example, *The Random House
College Dictionary*.  There was no &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; intended in
my comment.  It was an honest explanation of some prevailing
practices.

In the preparation of our Second College Edition, the
necessary increase in our basic vocabulary list coupled with
the increases in the costs of paper and production forced us to
a reconsideration, and we decided to include as run-ins terms
that were both self-evident and in relatively common use.  We
have still managed to eschew the *permutableness's* and *torturingly's*
of some dictionaries.

In any case, as you are surely familiar with the current
dictionary, it is disingenuous of you to put your description of
our earlier practices in the present tense (and with the fabricated
*flavorfully* and *flatterer* yet) and then accuse me of
&ldquo;propaganda.&rdquo;
