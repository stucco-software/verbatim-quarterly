## A Hoagie By Any Other Name
*Dave Wilton, Albany, California*

>&ldquo;I wanna shake off the dust of this one-horse
town. I wanna explore the world. I wanna watch
TV in a different time zone. I wanna visit strange,
exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies! I want a
grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero! I want to live,
Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you, please?&rdquo;
—Homer Simpson

One of the amusements offered by my frequent
travels to Europe is seeing The Simpsons
translated into different languages. Homer speaking French or German is something to behold. But
sometimes I wonder if all of the humor translates
along with the words. The above-quoted passage is
one of the best jokes ever seen on that show—at
least to my inner linguist. But even in Britain,
where they don't bother to dub the original
American voices, probably only a few get the joke.
You see a hoagie, a grinder, a sub, and a hero are
one and the same thing. They are simply regional
names for a sandwich served on a large Italian roll
and filled with Italian meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and sprinkled with olive oil and spices.
Variations on the basic recipe are made by filling
the sandwich with other things, such as tuna salad,
roast beef, ham and cheese, meatballs, and all manner of other ingredients. Subs can be served either
hot or cold. All the exotic things that Homer associates with travel are simply roses by another name.
And Homer is just scratching the surface of the
lexical diversity of the sandwich. In addition to the
names he cites there are: poor boy, torpedo, Italian
sandwich, rocket, zeppelin or zep, blimpie, garibaldi, bomber, wedge, muffuletta, Cuban sandwich,
and spuckie. Most of these names are associated
with a particular region of the United States. The
names also fall into several distinct patterns of origin, from the shape (sub, torpedo, rocket, zeppelin, blimpie, and bomber), from the size (hero, hoagie),
from ethnic association (Italian sandwich, Cuban
sandwich), from the type of bread used (muffuletta,
spuckie), or from the fact that the sandwich is a
cheap meal (poor boy).

Where I grew up, in the town of Toms River on
the New Jersey Shore, we knew the sandwich as a
sub, short for submarine sandwich, so called
because the long, tubular shape resembles the submersible vessel. Sub is the general name for the
sandwich, found throughout the United States and
not associated with any particular region. The name
dates to the mid-1950s, although there is at least
one claim (made in 1967) that the word existed as
early as 1928.

It is often asserted that the name submarine
sandwich began in New London, Connecticut,
after the naval submarine base there, but there is
no evidence to support this contention. Sub, the
sandwich, is not associated with Connecticut in particular. (Although the Subway® chain of sandwich
shops got its start in 1965 as Pete's Super Submarine Shop in Bridgeport, about 70 miles from
New London.) And if the 1928 claim were true, it
would seem unlikely as that citation is from
Philadelphia.

Torpedo, related to sub, is found throughout the
U.S. It is often used to refer to a small or half-sized
sub, a torpedo roll being a smaller piece of bread.
I learned my first exotic name for the sandwich,
hoagie, during my earliest school days. We had subs
at home. We ate subs at local restaurants (sub-shops). But for some reason the school cafeteria
served hoagies. That's the name given to the sandwich in Philadelphia (also known for that otherfamous sandwich, the Philly cheesesteak, which can
be considered a variant on the basic sub theme).

_Hoagie_ permeated outward from Philadelphia,
attenuating in use as it traveled, until by the time it
reached Toms River it was known only in the school
cafeterias. (Whoever wrote the cafeteria menus for
the Toms River school system was probably from
Philadelphia.) _Hoagie_ is common throughout
Pennsylvania and much of southern New Jersey.
My portion of the Jersey Shore lacked a strong
Philly influence. Even today the main road from
Toms River to Philadelphia, Route 70, is a two-lane
country highway for much of its length. As a boy, I
rooted for the Mets, not the Phillies, even though
Veterans Stadium was much closer, as the crow
flies, than Shea. Our beaches were filled with visitors from Bergen County and New York, who came down the Garden State Parkway. Philadelphians
went to beaches further south: Long Beach Island,
Wildwood, and Ocean City. Hence, _hoagie_ was
somewhat of foreign term to the Jersey Shore of
my childhood.

The word _hoagie_ first appears in print in 1945,
with alternate spellings like _hoogie_ and _hoggie_
appearing as early as 1941. How it got its name is an
often debated topic.
The most commonly touted explanation is that
it comes from the name of Hog Island,
Philadelphia. In the early part of the twentieth century there was a shipyard on Hog Island (now the
site of the Philadelphia airport). During the First
World War, Italian-American shipyard workers, or
_hoggies_ as they were known, would bring large
sandwiches to work with them. The early spelling
of _hoggie_ makes this hypothesis attractive, but
there is a gap between the shipyard's years of operation and the earliest attestation of the sandwich
name in 1941. The shipyard operated full-bore
from 1917–20, after which production rapidly
declined before it closed completely in 1925. That
leaves only a handful of years for the name to catch
on in the city's consciousness and a gap of some fifteen years before the name is found in print. If the
name can be antedated further, the Hog Island
hypothesis will seem more likely, but for now this
explanation seems doubtful.
A variant on the above is that it comes from
_Hogan,_ a nickname for Irish workers at the shipyard. This has the same problem of dating, plus it seems unlikely that an Irish name would be associated with the Italian sandwich.

A second and more likely explanation is that an
enterprising restaurateur coined it. Al De Palma,
the self-proclaimed &ldquo;King of the Hoagies,&rdquo; claims
to have coined hoggie. In 1928, while working as a
jazz musician, De Palma saw some fellow musicians
eating a submarine. Impressed with the size of the
sandwich, De Palma remarked that, &ldquo;you had to be
hog to eat one.&rdquo; When the Depression hit, De
Palma couldn't find work as a musician and in 1936
opened up a sandwich shop. Recalling the sandwich and his remark from eight years before, he
made and sold hoggies in the shop. He was quite
successful, eventually opening a chain of hoagie
shops and earning himself his sobriquet.
De Palma's claim and story is consistent with
the date of the name's appearance. He opened his
sandwich shop in 1936 and the term ( hoggie )
appears in advertising copy by 1941.

Eames & Robboy include De Palma's account
as a footnote in their 1967 American Speech article.
They do not, however, give his name. But various
other accounts of the tale do and from these one
can determine who the &ldquo;King of the Hoagies&rdquo; was.
These other accounts often confuse various details
of the story, however. The WaWa (a Philadelphia-
area chain of convenience stores) website, for
example, places the 1928 incident among Italian
shipyard workers on Hog Island instead of among
jazz musicians—a chronological impossibility. But
the account in Eames & Robboy is in De Palma's
own words and presumably more reliable. De
Palma's account is also interesting because he
claims the sandwich was called a submarine as far
back as 1928. The earliest known written citation of
that term is from 1950. Of course, he is recalling
the incident some forty years after the fact and his
memory could be faulty.

Other suggestions as to the origin of hoagie
include: hoke sandwich, favored by hoboes who
were on the hoke; a reference to the pork or hog
meat in the sandwich; honky sandwich, called that
by blacks who saw whites eating them; and hookey
sandwich, favored by kids skipping school who
would buy them from sidewalk vendors. None of
these seem very likely.

>&ldquo;To a New Yorker like you, a hero is some sort
of weird sandwich, not some nut that takes on three
Tigers.&rdquo;
—Oddball (Donald Sutherland), _Kelly's Heroes_

Another term that I identified in childhood was
_hero._ Toms River is on the outskirts of New York
City's cultural sphere of influence. Like _hoagie,_ the
word _hero_ penetrated into the local vocabulary just
far enough to become familiar.

_Hero_ is attested to as early as 1947 and is distinctly a New York name for the sandwich. The most
common etymological explanation is that it is so
called because of its large size. It's often claimed that
_New York Herald Tribune_ food columnist
Clementine Paddleford coined the name in the
1930s, claiming the sandwich was so large &ldquo;you had to
be a hero to eat it.&rdquo; Alas, no one can find any record
of this in any of Paddleford's columns, or any use of
the term before 1947. But it does seem likely that the
name comes from the size of the sandwich.

An alternate explanation is that it is a folk etymology of _gyros_ (pronounced _yee-roh;_ phonetics
experts and those fluent in Greek may feel free to
pick at my representation of the proper pronunciation. The unvoiced _s_ represents the Greek spelling.
The _s_ is often dropped in English, presumably
because English-speakers take it to be a plural
form. My Microsoft® Word spell-checker, for
example, keeps objecting to formulations like &ldquo;a
gyros&rdquo; and &ldquo;gyros isn't.&rdquo;). Non-Greek New Yorkers
took the unfamiliar word and made it into the
familiar _hero._ It's a plausible explanation from a
phonological standpoint, but not from a cultural
one. The _hero_ is a distinctly Italian sandwich, not a
Greek one. And there is no way that someone could
mistake cold cuts on an Italian roll for a gyros,
which is lamb and tzatziki sauce in a pita. Besides,
_gyros_ isn't attested in English until 1968 and
appears to be a later addition to the American bill
of fare. It certainly was a later addition to mine. I
never saw a gyros until the Army sent me to
Germany in 1986. (Toms River had restaurants
owned by Greek-Americans, but none that served
Greek cuisine.) Due to the large number of Turkish
Gastarbeiter in Germany, we knew them by the
Turkish name, _döner kebab,_ anglicized by us G.I.s
into _donburger._

New York State, as opposed to the city, offers
some other regional variants. Around Buffalo, subs
are sometimes known as bombers. The name
bomber is not limited to Buffalo and is found scattered throughout the U.S. The term in Westchester
County and the Hudson Valley is wedge.
I can recall one other name for the sandwich
from my early childhood, blimpie ®. The eponymous chain of sub shops served blimpies. Other
establishments served subs; Blimpie served blimpies. The chain was founded in Hoboken, New
Jersey in 1964 and one of the early franchises was
in Toms River. After early childhood, the term disappeared from my vocabulary. The local Blimpie
shop closed and I've never seen one since—
although the chain is still in existence and second
only to Subway® in number of franchises. The
name was chosen by the chain's founders, a combination of blimp, from the shape of the sandwich,
and the –ie ending from hoagie.

Blimpie is etymologically unrelated to zeppelin
or zep (1960), another name for the sandwich, common in eastern Pennsylvania. With Lakehurst
Naval Air Station, site of the Hindenburg crash and
home of the Navy's lighter-than-air aviation program, right outside Toms River on Route 70, you
would think that this name would have caught on in
my hometown. But no, blimpie had to pull double
duty in representing the area's aviation history.
So my childhood was subs, with the occasional
hoagie or hero or a trademarked blimpie. I was a
little better off than Homer Simpson in that I
knew a few of the terms. My first real linguistic
shock happened on a church choir trip to New
England, where in Rhode Island I encountered
my first grinder.

Grinder is the term of art throughout most of
New England, with the notable exception of
Boston where it is less common. The name probably comes from the chewing or grinding your
teeth do when consuming the sandwich. It dates
to at least 1946. Many people make a distinction
between grinders and other subs in that they use
grinder to mean a hot sub, but this is not the original sense. The original grinders were the familiar
cold cut subs we know and love. Hot sandwiches
are often known as oven grinders. And you occasionally see the alliterative _guinea grinder_ that
associates the sandwich with its Italian-American
heritage, however derogatorily.

Boston has its own local name for the sandwich,
_spuckie_ (also _spukie, spooky,_ and _spucky_ ). The
name comes from _spucadella,_ a type of Italian
sandwich roll. This local Southie name appears to
be dying, being replaced by the generic _sub._
After being surprised by _grinder,_ I was better
prepared when I encountered my next lexical variation on the sandwich. I joined the army in 1985
and they sent me to Fort McClellan, Alabama for
my officer's basic course. I quickly discovered that
the stuff they served at breakfast that looked like
Cream of Wheat wasn't and the green vegetables
that looked like spinach weren't. Upsetting as grits
and collard greens were to my Yankee notions of
proper food, I did delight in the discovery of hush-puppies. But while these foods were strange and
new to me, I also discovered a new name for a
familiar sandwich, the _poor boy._

The _poor boy_ got its start in New Orleans and
spread out across the South from there. It's attested to as early as 1931. The name most likely comes
from the fact that subs are cheap, but filling meals
for &ldquo;poor boys.&rdquo;
The best-substantiated claim for the coinage of
_poor boy_ is that of Clovis and Benjamin Martin,
brothers who opened a sandwich shop on the New
Orleans waterfront in 1921. They claim to have
invented the sandwich and its name, which were
quickly copied by their competitors. Their justification for the name is that it is a hearty sandwich for
the workingman who doesn't make much money.
In Puerto Rico there is a similar sandwich,
known as the _niño pobre._ Whether the sandwich
and its name emigrated from New Orleans or
whether it came to that city from the Caribbean is
not known. The same sandwich is available elsewhere in Latin America under the name _obrero_
'laborer.' The Martin brothers profess to have been
unaware of these Spanish variants.

Being from New Orleans, some insist that the
_poor boy_ has a French origin. Two theories contend.
One is that it is from _pour le bois,_ a meal taken into
the woods by lumberjacks. The second is that it is
from _pourbois,_ a tip or gratuity. Street urchins would knock at convent doors seeking a pourbois,
and the nuns would give them a sandwich.
There are two Southern variants of the poor
boy that are not subs in the strictest sense. The first
is also a New Orleans creation, the muffuletta. The
muffuletta takes its name from the bread, a Sicilian
dialectical name. Unlike the long, tubular shape of
a sub, the muffuletta is round. The muffuletta was
added to the menu of New Orleans cuisine in 1910,
when the Central Grocery on Decatur Street started serving them.

The second Southern variation is the Cuban
Sandwich. While it has the familiar tubular shape
of a sub, it is Cuban rather than Italian in origin
and, properly made, contains a different combination of meats and is flattened in a sandwich press.
Found mainly in Miami and southern Florida (no
surprise), the sandwich has been part of the local
cuisine since 1901.

In a few places subs are called rockets. In
Madison, Wisconsin they have been known as
garibaldis. And there are undoubtedly other local
names for the venerable sandwich.

Why so much lexical diversity in a sandwich?
Probably because no one can lay claim to inventing
it. Slicing an Italian roll and filling it with meat,
cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes hardly requires culinary expertise or inventiveness. It was undoubtedly
created de novo many times across the United
States and given a different name each time. Many
of the more regional names appear to be going by
the wayside as American culture becomes more
and more homogenized, but hoagie, hero, grinder,
and poor boy remain strong and so far are resisting
being overtaken by sub, even as garibaldi, wedge,
bomber, zeppelin, rocket, and spuckie fade from the
American lexicon.

## Greguerías: Squeals/Pipsqueaks? The Work of Ramón Gómez de la Serna
*Walter Redfern, Reading*

Born in Madrid in 1891, and later living in
Buenos Aires, Ramón Gómez de la Serna (he telescoped himself to just 'Ramón') first published his
_greguerías_ in 1910. This cornucopious author was
also a globettroting lecturer, orating on occasion in
circuses while swinging from a trapeze or perched
on an elephant's back.
Though he no more came out of nowhere than
any of us, he was a true original. What he called his
&ldquo;danceable philosophy&rdquo; harks back to medieval
Spanish Arabic poetry, which is based on acute
observation (essential in the desert, but still serviceable in cities and gardens) of human, animal, and
botanical phenomena. Or climatic: here is Ramón
on various weathers:

>Rain is melancholy because it takes us back to
the time when we were fishes.
>
>A thunderstorm is the first day at school all
over again.
>
>Electricity is God's nervous system.
>
>The rainbow is a dry-cleaner's neon advert.

Ramón offered umpteen explanations for his
choice of the term _greguería,_ which means 'hubbub, outcry,' and, by extension, 'the squeals of
piglets around the sow.' In general, what things,
life, the universe, and everything murmur to us. He
makes the tacit talkative, the dumb world an open
book, chattering to readers. Although he makes a
song-and-dance about the need not to confuse
_greguerías_ with maxims or other congealed asseverations, he cannot resist teaching us, in effect, to
open our ears and eyes. Like Nicholson Baker, he is
the poet of littleness.
Many greguerías are blatantly precious, conceits, but no less serious for all that:

>Some men with wooden legs turn green in  
>Spring and rebecome satyrs.  
>
>The human ear is forever asking questions.  
>
>Our head is a fish-tank for ideas.  
>
>Dust is full of old and forgotten sneezes.  
>
>In the phone-book we are all Lilliputians.  
>
>An embrace is a necklace without a fastener.  
>
>After using toothpaste we bare our teeth like wild animals.  

The majority are fleeting impressions (are there
any other sorts?), but the apparently related haiku,
in his eyes, is inferior, because too fragile and
evanescent:

>Some dirty skies look as if water-colourists had
cleaned their brushes on them.  
>
>Seagulls are born from handkerchiefs waving
goodbye on jetties.  
>
>The feline gaze of screws.  
>
>The hardest fish to land is a bar of soap in the
bath.  

As befits a Modernist, many, while natural in
their gracefulness, are autoreferential:

>Giblets are a chicken's greguerías.
>The typing keyboard is the alphabet's false
teeth.

All are resolutely anthropomorphic:

>Sometimes flies look as if they're trying to rip
their heads off, sick to death of being flies.  
>
>The peach is a blonde with her hair parted in
the middle.
>
>Nature is sad. Have you ever seen a tree smile?
>
>We thought of turtle soup when we saw the
tureen on the creature's back.

Greguerías are quintessentially metaphors.
They twin two objects or two ideas that up to then
had each been an only child.

>Looking upwards in a narrow street you see the
sky's cleavage.
>
>Sleep is a lost-property office.
>
>Mussels are the sea's castanets.
>
>Every statue is like a blind beggar holding out
his hand for alms.
>
>Nostalgia is the neuralgia of memory.
>
>Many make you think twice, or for the first
time. 

Greguerías, it has been said, are the pencil-
sharpeners of ideas.

>The moon is the wrong way round.
>
>The sea spends its time throwing buckets of
cold water on the land to bring it to its senses.
>
>Every grave contains an alarm-clock set for the
Last Judgement.
>
>Consoling thought: worms die too.
>
>The bagpiper wears his lungs and larynx outside his body.

Ramón is the poet of the trivial, who glories in
it. He agrees with Chesterton that the telescope
diminishes the universe, whereas the microscope
enlarges it. He could have called his 'micro-ideas,'
to use Chesterton's oxymoron, _Tremendous Trifles._
Both escalate the minuscule.

Why did Ramón reject &ldquo;Alphabet soup is good
for dyslexics&rdquo;? Like any humourist, indeed any
human being, he reserved the right to contradict
himself, to practise what he preached against. Hence
the numerous axioms, saved by humour from being
pedantic. But only metaphorically do his metaphors
have anything to do with piglets squealing.
This forerunner of Surrealism is a releasing
agent, a dowser. Whether his _greguerías_ offer
genuine insight into the inscape of reality is up to
each reader of VERBATIM, each verbatimocrat,
to judge. She or he might well wonder what this
hoo-ha about _greguerías_ has to do with language.
An even better question is: what isn't to do with
language?

_Qasidas,_ medieval Arabic poems, ended traditionally with a panegyric of some notable.
Ramón's prose-poems celebrate the mini-wonders of the world and, of course, himself. As Beau
Brummell said of a dandaical coat: &ldquo;I wear it to
advertise myself.&rdquo;

### EPISTOLA {Roger Backes}

An expression I have been hearing more and
more, and still more, to the point of irritation, is
various forms of &ldquo;... go ahead ...&rdquo;
It may be &ldquo;... go ahead and ...&rdquo; or &ldquo;... Just go
ahead and ...,&rdquo; etc.

It came to my attention at a conference in St.
Louis where I heard a young man give a treasurers
report with an average of 5.5 &ldquo;go aheads&rdquo; per minute!
When I talked to him about it, he was completely surprised and claimed I was wrong. I knew if he kept talking, I could prove my point. Sure enough, he
offered up a couple &ldquo;go aheads&rdquo; in his denial.
While I don't think I'd kill anyone for the overuse of this phrase, they might kill me for complaining about something they think I'm making up.
(&ldquo;Go ahead, make my day!&rdquo;)

So if you could just go ahead and send me some
information about this phrase, I'll just go ahead and
sign off for now. I need to go ahead and get some
real work done.

## Blog This
*Steve Lawson, Colorado Springs, Colorado*

Since the late 1990s, the _weblog,_ or _blog_ (or,
uncommonly, _'blog_ ) has been one of the most popular methods of publishing on the World Wide Web. A
_weblog_ is a web page that is updated on a more-or-
less daily basis with entries or _posts._ The content of a
post can vary widely, but the typical entry contains a
link to another web page along with a sentence or a
paragraph indicating why the person who wrote the
entry chose to link to that particular page. The posts
are date- and time-stamped and arranged in reverse
chronological order, so the newest entry is always at
the top of the page. That way, frequent readers of a
blog can start reading at the top, and stop when they
reach the first post that they've read before. Those
time-related factors—frequent updates arranged in
reverse chronological order—are the defining
aspects of the weblog. Some blogs read like diaries,
others like commentary on current affairs.

Few new words have been coined that are based
on the original term, _weblog,_ but now that _blog_ has
been clipped from the original, it has taken off with
any number of derivatives. _Blog_ is a synonym for
_weblog,_ but, unlike _weblog, blog_ has also been
verbed, meaning 'to create a new entry in a weblog,'
or simply 'to write,' e.g., &ldquo;Here are some photos
from the wacky, New York-based BDSM-themed
workout that Cory blogged about earlier this week&rdquo;
, or &ldquo;I talked with Dave Winer on the phone a little
while ago, and I notice he's already blogged the conversation!&rdquo; As the examples show, usage of the verb
form is not yet standard; does one _blog_ an event (in
the same way one would _log_ it, or _note_ it, or _cover_ it
in the journalistic sense), or does one _blog about_ an
event (as one would _write about_ or _talk about_ it)?
People who keep blogs are known as _bloggers_ as
in &ldquo;how about we make tomorrow ... a Bloggin'
Lovefest. Devote one post to a blogger you love.&rdquo;
_Blogger™_ is also the name of one of the software
tools that allows bloggers to update their weblogs easily and save older posts automatically in an archive.

With the proliferation of wireless networks in
hotels and convention centers, it has become relatively easy for bloggers to post to their blogs using
properly-equipped laptops while they are actually still
witnessing the event they are writing about rather
than waiting until later to sum things up. This is
called liveblogging as in &ldquo;Donna Wentworth has been
liveblogging the proceedings of iLaw Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil on Copyright.&rdquo; Liveblogged entries make up
for in immediacy what they lack in spellchecking.
A particularly neat coinage is blogrolling, the
practice of posting a list of links to other weblogs.
Such a blogroll list looks like a roll, or register, but
it also recalls logrolling, the practice of mutual
back-scratching in the world of politics or literature. When blogs were in their infancy, it was considered de rigueur for blogging to be reciprocal—
&ldquo;you blog me and I'll blog you back.&rdquo; Now, there is
more of a blog hierarchy, with some blogs and bloggers being exceptionally well known, and others
toiling in (often deserved) obscurity. It can no
longer be assumed that the most popular weblogs
will reciprocate when it comes to blogrolling.

The term blogerati has been used to refer to
some of the most prominent members of the weblog
culture: &ldquo;Perhaps I should get around to creating a
Blogarhythm website. One that would track and predict when certain members of the blogerati are going
to go off their rockers again.&rdquo; No self-respecting blogger would refer to him- or herself as a member of the
blogerati, and usage of the word implies a gentle (or
not-so-gentle) mockery. The term is, of course, based
on the Latin literati (in English use, according to the
OED, since Robert Burton borrowed it in 1621 to
refer to China's learned class). The blogerati themselves may be more familiar with the word digerati,
used to refer to the movers and shakers of digital
business and culture. Perhaps that link to digerati
explains blogerati's relative popularity compared to
blognoscenti (as in &ldquo;The Raging Cow strategy has
annoyed some members of the blognoscenti&rdquo;).
Blognoscenti also seems truer to its source word,
cognoscenti (from the Italian, used in English since
the late 18th century, also according the OED ), but a
Google search shows many fewer uses of
blognoscenti as compared to blogerati.

The science fiction writer William Gibson
famously coined the term cyberspace in his novel
Neuromancer to refer to the &ldquo;virtual space&rdquo; in which
electronic communication takes place. Some bloggers have used the term _blogspace_ to refer to the
world of blogging, but the most popular word for that
concept at the moment is _blogosphere._ The word was
apparently coined by William Quick, of the _Daily
Pundit_ (an achievement recognized by William Safire
in his _New York Times Magazine_ column of July 28,
2002). Based, of course, on _atmosphere, stratosphere,_
and similar words, the gaseous connotation of _blogosphere_ seems appropriate, given the constantly changing world of weblogs, which are held together
through the loose bonds of interconnected hyperlinks, and which seems to be expanding indefinitely
(and which can be a forum for a lot of hot air).

Another word for the same concept is _Blogistan,_
coined, no doubt, during late 2001 or early 2002 when
all eyes were on Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan,
and their Central Asian neighbors. _Blogistan_ gave rise
to extensions such as &ldquo;Radio Free Blogistan,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Distributed Republic of Blogistan,&rdquo; but has fallen into disuse. Perhaps this is because world affairs
have moved on, or perhaps it is simply because _blogosphere_ seems more appropriate. Unlike the _blogosphere's_ infinitely expandable universe, _blogistan_
would seem to have distinct (if permeable) borders.

_Blog rot_ appears to have been coined by blogger
Buzz Bruggeman, a term which he defined as &ldquo;not
staying in the game and offering up great stuff on a
daily basis.&rdquo; The _Laughing Librarian_ weblog uses the
same term to describe a blog that peters out after a
few weeks or months (after trying the less-catchy
term _blog decay_ ), pointing out that nobody can be
great literally every day. As a nonce-word, _blog rot_ has
more going for it than just assonance and the one-two
punch of short one-syllable words; it also recalls _link
rot,_ the well-established term that describes the tendency of links on the World Wide Web to go bad over
time (as web pages are taken down or moved).

Weblogs have become a fixture of online culture
after just a few years. Similarly, the language of blogging and bloggers has become noted by the linguistic establishment. _Weblog, blog_ (n. and v.), _blogger,_ and
_weblogger_ all have draft entries dated March 2003 in
the _OED Online._ For the newest permutations and
coinages, though, the enterprising linguist will have
to go to the source and brave the blogosphere.

#### EPISTOLA {Robert E. Rains}

Re: p. 12 of VERBATIM XXVIII/1, I note
three slips (one legal, one of verbiage and one oversight) in one short page. Legal: &ldquo;The terms used by those not legally married range from the legal
( common law marriage ) to the jocular ( shacking
up ).&rdquo; Wrong: Those who are found by a court to
have entered into a valid common law marriage are
legally married. As I tell my law students, being
married is rather like being pregnant: you either
are, or you aren't. Verbiage: &ldquo; Cohabitating is a clinical, sterile word used by statisticians.&rdquo; Poorly educated statisticians, perhaps. The preferred word is, of course, cohabiting. One inhabits a house rather
than inhabitates it. Oversight: &ldquo;Now that many
same-sex couples can have their relationships registered in Vermont and New York and in some Scandinavian countries as a civil union or registered
partnership , new terms should emerge.&rdquo; They
already have. I guess that no one has ever suggested, suggestively, to the author, &ldquo;I'll 'C U' in Vermont.&rdquo;

Telephone-canvassing has become a powerful
tool in local and national politics. Three months practising the art, on a candidate's behalf in the southwestern coastal and rural fringes during the General
Election of 2001 exposed me to a rich tapestry of voters' voices, as well as names that grow increasingly
surreal as memory telescopes the experience.

Some names predispose both owner and caller
to a fruitful exchange with an undercurrent of good
humour. _William Shakespeare_ proved to be a genial
retiree from the Midlands, _Richard Turpin_
answered as &ldquo;Dick Turpin,&rdquo; and _Francis Drake_ was
keen to singe the other side's beard, as it were.
Other names provoked the good humour only
in the canvasser, as when those apparently fitting
some ludicrous pattern occurred near each other in
the selective non-alphabetical list. What strange
seaside feast could bring together Mesdames _Stout,
Trout, Winkles, Scoffham, Butter,_ and _Salt?_ From
what undiscovered draft of a Hardyesque novel of
bucolic angst do _Miles Hitherday, Helen Harrower,
Mandy Hempseed,_ and _Aaron Ettles_ hail?

There are surnames, particularly of the hyphenated kind, that are disasters waiting to happen. Faced with a _Bodley-Tickell,_ either careful practice
with the stresses on the first and last syllables, or a
private pre-emptive venting of the supporter-alienating slip &ldquo;Bodily-Tickle&rdquo; may be in order.

Rehearsal is also advisable when dealing with
all-female households sharing surnames like _Slagg,
Bastard,_ and worse. Speech gremlins delight in subverting innocent enquiries in the hope of producing unfortunate utterances such as &ldquo;Which of
the three Hoares am I speaking to?&rdquo;
However, even the most off-script of responses
at least proceeds from a human being, which gives
the quick-tongued a chance to establish an informative dialogue. This is hardly possible with the
answering machines the caller constantly triggers,
and occasionally can start talking to before realisation comes. Various of the commercial ones
become familiar opponents, acquiring pseudo-personalities and labels like &ldquo;the plummy-voiced git&rdquo;
or &ldquo;the cooing Canadian.&rdquo;

Whatever the electoral results, it left one canvasser marvelling at the variety of regional and social accents still found among the middle-aged
and above, from velvety local burrs to the distinctive Scots, Midlands and Geordie of incomers, or the cut-glass-and-whiplash of Hauteur Heights. At
the beginning of the twenty-first century they are
alive and well and living in the West Country, wi'

Hempseed, Will'm Shakespeare, Francis Drake,

### HORRIBILE DICTU
*Mat Coward, Somerset, Britain*

One of the spam emails which I receive most
often is headed &ldquo;Best Dating Site for Interracial
Singles.&rdquo; This bothers me. I've met plenty of _multiracial_ singles and innumerable _interracial couples_ —but surely you can't be an interracial _single_?

I'll tell you something else that bothers me: is
the phrase &ldquo;spam emails&rdquo; tautologous? I suspect it
is, but I just can't bring myself to write _spam_ and
leave it at that; either the usage is as yet too unfamiliar, or I'm the wrong generation, or both. In my
defence, let me note that my computer has the
same problem; its spellchecker doesn't recognise
_spam_ (unless it's typed with an upper case initial.)
No doubt VERBATIMreaders will be able to
sort that one out for me. This column is always
delighted to hear from readers, via the magazine's
usual addresses, commenting on Horribiles already
discussed or nominating their own.

In a recent issue, I wondered whether the
Pentagon's employment of teen slang was designed to
lessen the impact of controversial statements. E.
Noel Fletcher of Los Angeles takes this thought in a
different direction, by looking at the broadening of
the application of the term _rip off_ in the 1960s. &ldquo;By
calling both _rip offs,_ activists suggested moral equivalency between an overcharge at a newsstand and a
bank hold-up by radicals. Ultimately any profit from
any activity was deemed to be a _rip off._ The usage was
unthinkingly adopted by people who did not realize
their acceptance and use of that terminology in daily
discourse promoted a radical agenda.&rdquo;

Raymond Harris of north London forwarded a
letter he'd received promising that &ldquo;the book is finally on it's way to you,&rdquo; and added this note:
&ldquo;Greengrocer's apostrophe—from a bookseller!&rdquo; I
wonder if Mr Harris was delighted or horrified by
this just plain errant apostrophe (not really a greengrocer's apostrophe, which is usually added to give an
added fillip to a plural, such as _banana's_ ); both, I
imagine, if he's anything like me.

A number of people have suggested &ldquo;complete
stranger&rdquo; as an example of superglued words; can there ever be a partial stranger? (Which reminds
me, if you'll forgive the diversion, of a routine performed decades ago by the British comedy duo,
Morecambe and Wise. &ldquo;I'm not a complete idiot,
you know,&rdquo; huffs the straight man. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replies
the comic, &ldquo;which bit is missing?&rdquo;)

Sports commentators can generally be relied
upon to help me fill this page. Lately, I've noticed
they've become very fond of using ordinary to
mean bad : &ldquo;England were worse than disappointing out there today, John, they were downright
ordinary.&rdquo; Very ordinary has become quite common—if you see what I mean—but the other day I
heard ordinariness taken to new heights, when an
opening post-game gambit of &ldquo;That was a very ordinary display by the boys today, John,&rdquo; was effortlessly topped with &ldquo;It was very ordinary indeed,
John, shockingly ordinary—that was an extraordinarily ordinary performance by the boys.&rdquo; Got
that? The boys weren't very good.

I think I've just got space to briefly revisit an
old favourite—the &ldquo;parental guidance&rdquo; plague, and
the strangulated euphemisms it gives rise to. A current British TV advertisement for a children's film
is the first I've seen to warn that the picture
&ldquo;Contains mild language.&rdquo; Shouldn't mild language
be the opposite of the dreaded strong language—
and therefore desirable—or has language really
become a synonym for obscenity?

I'll end this time with an example of admirable
honesty on the part of a British politician. Hansard ,
the parliamentary record, recently recorded an
exchange which began with an opposition MP asking:
&ldquo;I welcome any steps to try to improve the quality
and depth of regulatory impact assessments, some of
which, I think we all recognise, have been lamentably
superficial, but would the honourable gentleman
consider the case for a system of routine post-implementation audit of regulatory impact assessments
and the costs actually imposed on business by legislation, so that we can generate a feedback to the
process of pre-legislative regulatory impact assessments that might over time improve their quality?&rdquo;
The honourable gentleman in question replied:
&ldquo;I do not understand that.&rdquo;

#### INTER ALIA: *Ersatz Languages*
*Gordon S. Jones, Draper, Utah*

Some years ago, I asked S.I. Hayakawa, the
noted linguist, what the technical term was for what
I called &ldquo;ersatz languages.&rdquo; Sam was Senator Sam
then, known as &ldquo;Sleeping Sam,&rdquo; because of his
habit of going to sleep on the floor of the U.S.
Senate. Anyway, Sam said he really didn't know,
though he was, of course, familiar with them. He
suggested that I get in touch with the people that
publish VERBATIM. They would know what to
call them if anyone did.

This answer was not as much help as you might
expect, since my reason for asking was that I was
thinking of writing an article for VERBATIM about
ersatz languages. The upshot was that I didn't write
the article, and then Melanie Falcon did
(&ldquo;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About
Pig Latin But Were Afraid To Ask,&rdquo; XXVII/1).
What I wanted to write about, and am now
writing about, is Horse Latin, a much more dignified and useful language, the one we spoke in our
family as children and in which we still converse
from time to time.

In Horse Latin, one inserts the syllable _ib_ before
each vowel sound in a word. _Horse Latin_ itself
becomes, then, _Hiborse Libatibin,_ the silent _e_ meriting no notice. The _i_ is always long, and almost always
stressed. _Bibooks, mibusibic,_ the _ibarts,_ and (especially) the _nibeighbibors,_ all were discussable and
discussed in Horse Latin. Whereas Pig Latin makes
only the one minor change no matter how long the
word, so that _ansubstantiationtray_ is immediately
recognizable to the uninitiated, _tribansibubstibantibiibatibon_ is a total muddle, making Horse Latin
much more satisfactory as a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; language.

Not that Horse Latin is perfect. As the last
example demonstrates, Horse Latin does tend to
lead to long words, and one can easily go astray in
the middle of sesquipedalian constructions
( _sibesquibipibedibalibiban cibonstribuctibons_ ).
And words using the letter _i_ a lot, or (even worse) the syllable ib can get overly involved. I once wrote
a little poem about ibexes, irises, ilexes, and ibises,
that was a marvel in Horse Latin! Luckily for you, I
have forgotten it now.

A regular feature of our family reunions is the
singing (with great gusto) of &ldquo;The Garbageman's
Daughter,&rdquo; and then its repetition (with even more
gusto) in Horse Latin (&ldquo;Thibe Gibargibagemiban's
Dibaughtiber&rdquo;). My staid eldest sister once joined
me in belting this one out to a transfixed (not to say
horrified) group of my friends at a party at our
house in Virginia. That may have been the high
point of my experience with this happy tongue.

Although her article was devoted to the decidedly less satisfactory Pig Latin, Ms. Falcon does mention Horse Latin (or at least a dialect of it), misidentifying it as &ldquo;Oppish.&rdquo; As it happens, I speak fluent
Oppish as well as Horse Latin, and I can tell you that
Ms. Falcon's informant seriously misled her. Rather
than inserting the op syllable after each consonant in
a word, in fact Oppish inserts the syllable before
each vowel sound. No wonder Ms. Falcon could not
pronounce umbrella. It should actually be the easily
managed opumbropellopa, or in the true dialect, the
(equally unintelligible to the non-Horse Latin speaker) ibumbribelliba.

When I first ran into Oppish, it was called
&ldquo;Hoppigopinsopon topalk,&rdquo; after the Higginson
family of Denver, Colorado ( Copoloporopadopo ),
who claimed to have invented it. Though only experienced then in the ib dialect of Horse Latin, I was immediately able to understand the native Op
speakers, and after taking a few minutes to re-wire
my brain, able to speak it as well. (My cousin's family speaks a dialect they call Chicken Latin, which uses the syllable ik instead of ib or op. The i is kept
short, as in chicken, which make it difficult to pronounce, in my opinion.)

I am grateful to Ms. Falcon for breaking the ice
in VERBATIM on ersatz languages, and hope that
she will accept these few notes on the subject in the
spirit in which they are meant.

#### EPISTOLA {Andrew Tucker}

Kathleen E. Miller's article on naming wars
(VERBATIMXXVIII/1) mentions the major participants in the First and Second World Wars. Curiously, she ignores Russia, the biggest player in both wars in terms of the size of army and number of casualties.

As a member of the Triple Entente with Britain
and France, Russia entered the war against Germany and Austria in August 1914. Their military reverses and heavy losses were a major cause of the Revolution in 1917. In March 1918 they made a separate peace with Germany.

In World War II, Russia joined with Britain in
fighting Hitler after the Germans attacked them in
June 1941. They continued in the war until their
troops captured Berlin in May 1945. They lost about
eleven million combatants and seven million civilians.
As far as names go, the Russians never called it
World War II. To them it is always _The Great Patriotic
War,_ clearly showing their view of it as a fight for
national survival, rather than a global conflict.
Incidentally, John Curtin was Australian Prime
Minister, not Austrian.

from each other on a bench in a bistro. She
appeared distraught; he looked perplexed. The caption went something like this: &ldquo;You can't blame me

Today I received an email message containing
this gem: &ldquo;We will need to be nibble to take advantage of this.&rdquo;
[Is there] a word for a phenomenon that sometimes afflicts me in conversation—mixing up the vowels in two words which are synonyms? When I
want to say mainly or mostly, I often come out with
moanly, and then when I try to correct myself,
mastely. I can't think of another set of words that
produces that confusion, so perhaps it doesn't
deserve a word of its own.

P.S. Speaking of malapropisms, a friend of mine

#### EPISTOLA {Dan Pratt}

A couple comments on the article &ldquo;Say It with
Words&rdquo; (XXVIII/1) In Latin, the word order Te amo
is at least as likely as the order amo te.
Virtually all grammars say the verb was normally at the end of its clause unless some special
emphasis was desired. St. Augustine famously
wrote &ldquo;Sero te amavi.&rdquo;
One of my favorite languages for &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; is
Hungarian: szeretlek, where the -lek ending specifies
both the subject &ldquo;I&rdquo; and object &ldquo;you&rdquo; (and also illustrates vowel harmony). I believe other combinations
of subject-object pronouns have no special form.

### CLASSICAL BLATHER: *It's Only Music, Don't Be Scherzo*
*Nick Humez, argentarius@juno.com*

&ldquo;Recent neuroimaging data,&rdquo; writes Aniruddh
Patel, &ldquo;suggests an overlap in the processing syntactic relations in language and music.&rdquo;[^1] Perhaps it
comes as no surprise that the field of music is rich in
its own terminology describing gradations of volume
and tempo ( _forte_ and _piano, lento_ and _allegro_ ), techniques specific to particular musical instruments
( _pizzicato, scordatura, con legno_ ) and the forms that
a movement or part of one within a compositions
can take, ( _rondo, scherzo, da capo aria, coda_ ).

It is no accident that most of these terms are
Italian, for it was in Italy that the musical paradigm
shift from high Renaissance counterpoint to the
beginnings of the baroque first occurred, the rest of
Europe following suit. Claudio Monteverdi wrote
the first Western opera ( _Orfeo,_ 1607) even as
Shakespeare was catching his breath from producing _King Lear_ and _Macbeth_ (1605–6).[^2] And it was not musical style alone that percolated north from
the sunny Mediterranean: As Switzerland exported
mercenaries, so Italy exported musicians and their
instruments. One of the proudest assets of Louis
XIV's court was his famous string orchestra, the
&ldquo;Twenty-Four;&rdquo; it would have been a surprise if
there were no Italians among them, let alone no
Italian violins.[^3] François Couperin's _L'Apothéose de
Lully,_ a trio sonata with narration describing the
entry into heaven of Jean-Baptiste Lully, the Sun
King's star court composer, concludes with a reconciliation between Lully and his younger rival, the Italian composer Archangelo Corelli, with the proviso that Italian movement names be henceforth
known by their Gallic equivalents.[^4] Wishful thinking
on the part of the French: Italian terminology had
already had a corner on the discourse of music (and
arguably how we map it onto our minds) for a century; and so it continues down to the present day.

Terms referring to _tempo_ 'time' include _allegro,_
'fast' (literally, 'happy'), _andante_ 'going along,' i.e. not too fast, adagio figuratively 'slow,' literally 'a
proverb or adage,' thus by analogy, 'in a sententious
manner,' lento (the normal Italian word for 'slow'),
and largo 'large,' hence 'very slowly;' allargando
means 'broadening the tempo.'[^5] These may be further modified by appending moderato 'moderately' ma non troppo 'but not too much' or assai 'enough,'
i.e. 'very.' Faster than allegro are (allegro) vivace
'lively' and presto 'nimbly,' which is very fast
indeed. Metronomes will sometimes carry scales
indicating corresponding settings for the tempo
described in words; thus the Franz Electronic
Metronome advises setting the quarter note equal
to between 100 and 152 beats per minute for
presto, 80 to 160 for vivace, 84 to 144 for allegro, 66
to 126 for moderato, 56 to 88 for andante, 50 to 76
for adagio, 52 to 108 for lento, and 42 to 66 for
largo.[^6] (There is considerable overlap among these
subjective categories.)

Volume is indicated by forte 'strong, loud,' indicated in the musical score by the single italic letter f, and piano 'soft,' p in the score; the pianoforte
(nowadays shortened to piano ) was so named
because it allowed one to play both soft and loud
passages on it without the addition of supplementary ranks of strings (as on a harpsichord—Italian (clavi)cembalo, originally 'zither with keys,' whence
French clavecin, 'harpsichord') or ranks of organ
pipes.[^7] Mezzo piano ( mf ) and mezzo forte ( mp ) are
intermediate steps between loud and soft ( mezzo
means 'middle'), louder or softer being indicated by
superlatives: fortissimo, 'very loud,' represented by
ff and pianissimo ( pp ). Crescendo means 'growing
(louder),' and diminuendo , 'diminishing (in volume),' while sforzando means 'beginning loud, dropping quickly to soft' (derived from the verb
sforzare, 'to constrain').

Since the string section is the core of most
orchestras, it may come as no surprise that there
are a host of terms referring particularly to string
technique. Pizzicato means 'plucked,' its opposite
being arco, 'with the bow.' Not just the horsehaired
side of the bow need be used, however; there is a
technique called col legno, 'with the wood,' in
which the strings are struck by the back of the
bow.[^8] Tremolo 'trembling' is produced, according
to Laszlo Boehm, &ldquo;by the extremely rapid alternation of a very short down-bow and up-bow with the upper end of the bow.&rdquo;[^9] String scores include special marks for detached notes: A dot above a note
indicates _spiccato_ 'unhooked, lopped off,' a quick-
tempo short stroke in the middle of the bow in
which the bow actually bounces off the string; a
vertical wedge over a note means _martellato_ 'hammered' or _secco_ 'dry,' played with short bowing and a forceful, sudden release. Other special effects in
bowing are _sul ponticello_ 'on the [little] bridge,' in
which the strings are bowed very close to the
bridge of the instrument, producing a reedy sound,
and _sul tasto,_ which means 'over the fingerboard'
(literally 'on the touch'), producing a sound Boehm
calls &ldquo;flute-like.&rdquo;

_Con sordino_ means 'with the mute;' this is one
of several terms used by string players but common
to other musicians as well. So are _legato_ (literally,
'tied,' hence 'smoothly'—the root is the same as
that of _ligature, religious,_ and _obligation_ ), _arpeggio_
a 'broken chord,' from _arpa,_ 'harp,' _staccato_ ('short,'
literally 'untied'), and glissando ('sliding,' in which
one goes from one note to the next not by discrete steps but in a continuously varying pitch.[^10] Slide
trombones are particularly good at this, but the
same effect can also be produced by a kettledrum,
almost always with humorous intent.
(Percussionists also use the terms _tremolo_ and
_secco,_ the last in the special sense of 'dry and muffled;' the term _suffocato_ 'suffocated' refers to damping a pair of cymbals immediately after they
are struck.)

Playing with expression is guided by a number
of Italian terms as well: _cantabile_ 'songlike,' agitato
'agitated,' _con fuoco_ 'with fire,' _grave_ 'serious,'
_piangendo_ 'tearful,' and _espressivo_ 'with expression'). Performance instructions include _da capo_ 'from the beginning,' literally 'from the head') or
_dal segno_ 'from the sign,' i.e. a mark indicating the
beginning of the repeated passage) _al Fine_ 'to the
end,' generally indicated by the italicized word _Fine_
and a double bar). First and second endings are
designated respectively by _Prima volta_ and _Secondavolta._ ( Volta literally means 'turn.') An additional
section appended after a repeated section (or, in
sonata form, after the recapitulation) is called a
coda 'tail').

It is to Italian that we owe the names for
instruments in the string section themselves. The
original word viola seems to have come from
Provençal violar, thought to be an imitative verb for
the sound made by a bowed stringed instrument.[^11]
Italian originally distinguished between the viola
da gamba 'leg fiddle,' which had gut frets and was
held between the knees, and the viola da braccia
'arm fiddle,' whose name survives both as English
viola and in its German name, Bratsche. A little
viola was a violino (whence violin ); a big one was a violone (now called a double bass in English and a contrabasso in Italian), and a violoncello 'little big
viola' became shortened in English to 'cello.[^12] (The
apostrophe is now generally omitted.) Other instruments in the string family have long ago gotten their
gold watches and retired, such as the pocket violin
favored by 18th-century dancing masters and the
arpeggione, a six-stringed, bowed bass viol in guitar
tuning, whose fleeting existence in the early 19th
century would be utterly forgotten but for a single
splendid sonata written for the instrument by Franz
Schubert, nowadays played on the double bass.

The names for the voice parts in a choir are
likewise Italian: bass from bass, 'low,' tenor from
tenore —a word nowadays carrying several meanings including 'content,' 'substance,' 'true intent,' and 'harmony' as well as the tenor part in music,
originally where the melody was held ( tenuto )—
alto meaning 'high' (i.e. higher than the tenor part)
and soprano from sopra, 'above.'[^13] (Note that alto
and soprano have the masculine ending -o : Though
these two parts are now generally sung by women,
the Renaissance choir almost invariably consisted
of men on the three lower parts—the alto part was
in effect a high tenor line—and boys on the top.)

We are also indebted to Italian for the names
given to a number of forms of musical compositions: aria 'air,' fugue (the French adaptation of Italian _fuga,_ 'flight,' referring to the way in which
the voices seem to chase one another; an entry of
two voices of a fugue in close succession is referred
to as a _stretto,_ Italian for 'pressed, strict,' _sonata_
'sounded')—of which there were originally two
forms, the _sonata da chiesa_ 'church sonata') and
_sonata da camera_ 'chamber sonata,' of which the
latter won out— _sinfonia_ 'symphony,' _rondo_ 'round,'
so called from its returning to a single refrain in
between different bridge sections), _menuetto_ 'minuet.' In the evolution of the symphony from the
baroque dance suite the minuet was eventually
replaced with a _scherzo_ 'pleasantry, jest,' a fast
movement usually in triple time—whose name is
pronounced &ldquo;scairt so.&rdquo;

In the last century and a half, many composers
from other nations began using equivalent terms in
their own languages to get away from the terminological dominance of Italian. As of this writing, however, it seems unlikely that _moderato_ will be
supplanted by French _paisible, espressivo_ by
English _heartfelt,_ or _agitato_ by German _bewegt._ In
consequence, musical Italy may still boast a lasting
terminological and conceptual victory, achieved on
the same principle attributed to Confederate
colonel Nathan B. Forrest: &ldquo;Git there fustest with
the mostest.&rdquo;[^15]

[^2]: Nowhere is the shift from Renaissance to baroque more
salient than in Heinrich Schütz (1585–1672), who as a
young man studied for several years with Giovanni Gabrieli
in Venice, and after several court appointments back home
in Germany returned for additional lessons with
Monteverdi. Schütz's voluminous output is in a style that
nicely serves as a &ldquo;missing link&rdquo; between the late
Renaissance polyphony of the Gabrielis and German early
baroque masters such as Dietrich Buxtehude; a prime
example is the Schütz _Christmas History_ cantata (1664),
still frequently performed. In England, on the other hand,
physical separation from the rest of Europe often made for
a time lag in cultural developments already well underway
on the Continent; thus it was not till the very end of the
1600s that the British got the hang of writing music in the
new style, e.g. Henry Purcell's sword-and-sandal opera
_Dido and Aeneas._ (Dating from 1689, the year after the
Glorious Revolution that brought William and Mary to the
throne of England, it has a quaintly crashing libretto by Nahum Tate, better known for a number of psalm versifications which found their way into hymnbooks and are still sung today. The opera offers such doggerel delights as a
chorus of witches and fiends who sing, &ldquo;Destruction's our
delight;/Delight our greatest sorrow:/Elissa [i.e. Dido]
bleeds tonight,/And Carthage flames tomorrow!&rdquo;)

[^3]: Cremona alone had three illustrious violin-making houses. Andrea Guarneri opened his own shop there in 1654;
both he and Antonio Stradivari (1644–1737) had learned
the craft from Nicolò Amati, active in the same town till
shortly before the latter's death in 1684.

[^4]: Couperin's sonata was published in 1725; Lully had died
back in 1687, in his 55th year, from gangrene contracted
after he accidentally skewered his own foot with the staff
with which he was conducting a performance of his Te
Deum. Archangelo Corelli, 21 years his junior, retired from
public life at about the same age, having exercised great
influence over the musical scene at Rome as its foremost
violin performer and teacher; though he was by no means
a prolific composer, his work was highly influential, in part
because it showed how to reconcile the formal demands of
contrapuntal writing with the emergence of the violin as a
soloistic instrument. Even the English were said to prefer
his music to Handel's well into the early nineteenth century. See the articles on Corelli and Lully in Stanley Sadie,
ed., The Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopedia of Music
(New York/London: W.W. Norton and Company, 1988)—a
remarkably good reference resource for those without
either shelf space and/or money sufficient for the classic
20–volume Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicans.

Milton's years at Cambridge, before he went to Horton,&rdquo;

#### EPISTOLA {Olivier Kaiser}

I'm a new and French reader of VERBATIM,
which I discovered recently when I bought the
eponymous book edited by Erin McKean, itself
found while browsing in an English-language bookstore in Paris. After I read it with what I can only
describe as finger-licking pleasure (&ldquo;unputdownable,&rdquo; as reviewers of thrillers are fond of neologizing), I asked for a subscription for my birthday and,
what's perhaps more surprising, actually got it,
together with a lovely handwritten note from the
UK publisher.
But to the point of this &ldquo;Epistola,&rdquo; for there is
one. I wanted to note a small mistake (most likely a
typo, given the erudition of the article) in Nick
Humez's otherwise tremendously entertaining article (&ldquo;Pants on Fire,&rdquo; XXVIII/2). The end of footnote 1 states that &ldquo;[in French], a liar is a _menteux_ .&rdquo;

Close, but no cigar: the correct word is actually
menteur. I swear this is true!
Finally, I read with interest Ms. McKean's EX
CATHEDRA column in the same issue, and found
myself hoping that one day I would muster enough
courage to actually submit an article to this magazine that manages to be at the same time so learned
and so much fun. Perhaps an article on the French
Verlan, since one is sought. In which case I will try
to &ldquo;illuminate without condescending&rdquo; and tell your
readers that Verlan is not really like &ldquo;the Pig Latin
of French,&rdquo; with all due respect to VERBATIM's
editor. The latter does exist, and is called Javanais
(which is also French for the much more official
Javanese language, so I'm afraid it's not a politically
correct name, but c'est la vie ...). As in Pig Latin,
Javanais is (or was, as it went out of fashion years
ago) spoken by adding a nonsense syllable (always
av or va, hence its name) after each consonant.
Thus, a simple bonjour becomes bavonjavour, and
the more complex chaussure 'shoe' is reshaped into
the hardly intellegible chavaussavurave. Unlike in
Pig Latin however, the first consonant of the word
is not moved to the end. Verlan, on the other hand,
consists of phonetically switching the first and second syllables of some (not all) two-syllable words,
so that for instance bonjour becomes jourbon, or
bizarre turns into the odd zarbi. Verlan itself
derives its name from l'envers 'reversed' in Verlan.
Since these rather simple beginnings, Verlan has
evolved somewhat, so that some Verlan words are
more difficult to decipher than others, but that is
another story.
I apologize for being so finnicky (or finicky, or
finiking, or finical, take your pick ...), but I assume
that is a common trait of a number of your readers.
In fact, it is likely that these small matters have
already been pointed out to you. But perhaps not
by French readers, you know, the kind that actually live in Paris and laugh themselves silly when they
learn that some grown-ups in the U.S. earnestly
believe that the epitome of a patriotic act is to
rename French fries into &ldquo;Freedom fries&rdquo;...

## AS THE WORD TURNS: *Latin Lovers*
*Barry Baldwin, Calgary, Alberta*

Eleanor Dickie, in her _Latin Forms of Address_
(2002), counts 244 terms of endearment against
149 insults, a statistic that may weaken the image of
Romans as unsentimental cold fishes.
Just a sample here, omitting the scores of obvious adjectives (e.g. _Dearest,_ in regular/comparative/superlative forms). For those VERBATIM
readers who remember their Latin, I add it parenthetically.

In Plautus' _The Little Carthaginian_ (vv.
360–63), a swain thus wheedles his girl: &ldquo;My pleasure, my delight, my life, my pleasantness, my kiss,
my honey, my colostrum, my softest little cheese.&rdquo;

Another Plautine comedy, _Donkey Girl_ (vv.
693-94), features this tart's address to a slave:
&ldquo;Duckling, dove or puppy, swallow, jackdaw, tiny
little sparrow.&rdquo;

Suetonius ( _Life of Caligula,_ ch. 13) says the
besotted populace hailed him as &ldquo;Star, chick, babe,
nursling.&rdquo;

The poets Martial ( _Epigrams,_ bk. 10 no. 68)
and Juvenal ( _Satire_ 6 vv. 191–96) rebuke women for
using Greek love-talk, especially _Zoe kai Psyche_
('My Life and Soul'), &ldquo;words fit only for under the
blanket.&rdquo; They were, though—mocks the philosopher-bard Lucretius ( _On the Nature of Things,_ bk. 4 vv.
1160–69)—useful to the man as euphemisms for
his lady's physical defects. This verbal technique is
also recommended in a fragment of Philaenis' sex
manual (all ancient sex manuals were attributed to
women).

Dorothy Sayers, in _Busman's Honeymoon,_ provides the best gloss: after the wedding night, Harriet Wimsey (née Vane) lies wondering if Lord
Peter's first words would be in English or French.

The first passage's _pleasantness (amoenitas),_
along with (elsewhere) _my commodity_ and _my
opportunity,_ affords scope to Marxist cash-nexus
analyses of love. _Little eye_ ( _ocellus_ ) is a bit loaded—Roman graffito-mongers often drew penises with an eye in the tip. Little lip (labellum) may be a paradoxical pun on labes ('ruin,' a regular insult). Kiss
is here savium: Catullus would later introduce basium (whence baiser, bacio, beso, etc.), poetically heaping his kisses onto Lesbia to the tune of 3,
(Ralegh's Now Serena Be Not Coy extends them to
infinity)—we may agree with Shakespeare's
amorous Antony, &ldquo;There's beggary in the love that
can be measured.&rdquo; Honey ( mel —there are several
cognate terms, plus a Pompeian wall-scribbler's
aphorism &ldquo;Lovers like bees live in honey&rdquo;) is the
obvious ancestor of amatory American, albeit there
is no Latin equivalent to &ldquo;Hi, Honey, I'm Home.&rdquo;

Colostrum (same in Latin), unexplained and
untranslated by Dickie, denotes beestings, another
compliment with possible barb. Cheese (caseus) in
Australian slang (so Eric Partridge) stands for wife
(Cockneyesque rhyming slang, cheese and kisses =
'missus'). In view of its concomitant adjective ( molliculus) , I deduce that the Roman lover would express this cheesy compliment &ldquo;con brie-o.&rdquo;

In the remorselessly zoöphile second address,
duckling (anaticula) is a unique sobriquet; although
Northern English duck (or ducks ) and theatrical
camp duckie come to mind, while in eighteenth-
century slang a ship's quartermaster was a duck-
fucker. The dove (columba) had a reputation for
lechery. As with us (cf. the poem Jackdaw of
Rheims ), jackdaws were proverbial thieves. The
sparrow (passer) was particularly libidinous, not
only at Rome, Chaucer's Sumner being &ldquo;as hoot
and lecherous as a sparwe.&rdquo; (I won't dilate on
British sparrowfart 'dawn,' except to wonder if
these birds are really that flatulent and who has
actually heard them erupt?) Some interpret
Catullus' poem on his mistress' deceased sparrow
(clearly Not A Well Bird) as a lament for his sexual
impotence, a Northern English expression for
which is my bird's dead. Dorothy Parker has the
last word here: &ldquo;That thing he wrote, the time the
sparrow died/Oh, most unpleaant—gloomy tedious
words!/I called it sweet, and made believe I
cried;/The stupid fool!—I've always hated birds!&rdquo;
Of the Caligulan compliments, chick (pullus)
was Roman (also old American) gay argot—cf. the
remarkably open allusions to prison homosexuality in Elvis's _Jailhouse Rock_ —while the American sense of _star_ 'hardened criminal' well suits this emperor.

Two final titbits, neither in Dickie. At school,
we learned _Mercimoni Lepidi!_ 'What a smart baggage!' for its grammar, but I fancy the Romans were more concerned with the genitals than the genitives. A barmaid in Petronius' _Satyricon_ is called a _bacciballum._ Nobody knows what this means.
'round as a berry' is one etymological possibility. I
have seen it rendered _butterball,_ not a candidate
for revival in this age of Calista Flockhart and other
Hollywood living skeletons. 'Pretty round thing'
and 'absolute peach' are two other modern British
translations. A French effort is _un superbe brin de
fille._ Two Teutonic stabs are _ein allerliebstes
Weibschen_ and _ein putziges Schnuckelchen_ —
German is really not designed for amatory discourse. A good example, this, of the day-to-day problems that confront classical editors; as Robert
Frost remarked, &ldquo;Poetry is what gets left out of the
translation.&rdquo;

Baldwin in future issues.]*

## Let There Be Light
*Larry Tritten, San Francisco, California*

As someone who tends to drink low calorie
beer, it occurred to me recently that some brands
are marketed as light beer and others as lite beer.
The difference between the two is a matter of stylistic ambience, and I by far prefer the former. To
be sure, the word lite is inescapable when one is
buying low calorie products. The makers of many of
them obviously consider purposely misspelled
words appealing to consumers (or possibly to trademark lawyers), although it is a practice whose
charm is lost on me. Light is an Old English word
that has a certain buoyancy and even subliminal
sense of zest, but lite is a mutated neologism that is
to the written word what a siren is to melody.

Yet the word lite is one of the milder subversions
of the integrity of the written word that consumers
are exposed to. Misspelling words for effect is a
ubiquitous practice among the purveyors of products
and services in America. Whether it exists to the
same extent in other countries I don't know. Most of
the tricks one can perform with words have descriptive terms, such as metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche,
and so on, but I am unable to find a term that defines
misspelling words for effect, and I suspect the reason
is that the practice was virtually nonexistent until
merchants and advertisers pioneered and refined it.

As advertising techniques go, it is exceeded in popularity only by anthropomorphism, i.e., humanizing products—peanuts, toilet bowls, blobs of dough, you
name it. Yet making the language do pratfalls for our
amusement is a concept that seems to me essentially
gauche and irritating. Walk down an aisle in any
supermarket and you can see the language doing not
just pratfalls, but half gainers, nose dives, and flip
flops. You can see it skid, lurch, and plummet. Korn
for corn. Cheez for cheese. Kleen for clean.

If I seem a little too stuffy in my attitude, let me
make it clear (not kleer) that I'm all for having fun
with words. Metaphors and similes, the actors and
musicians of language (to indulge in a bit of
metaphoric anthropomorphism), delight me. But
there is a poetic urge implicit in the use of metaphors and similes. Misspelling a word for
effect seems to me no more congruous with stylistic integrity than putting a lampshade on one's head
at a party is in tune with theatrical integrity.
Metaphors and similes do arabesques, glissades,
and entrechats, not pratfalls.

My lurid imagination conjures up a dreamlike
image: William Strunk and E.B. White, the authors
of the perennially popular _Elements of Style,_ wheel
their cart up to the checkout stand in a supermarket, and the cart contains _Ry Krisp, Rice Krispies,
Cheez It_ snack crackers, _Kleenex, Quik_ chocolate
milk, _Cookie Stix, So-Dri_ paper towels, _Chicken in
a Biskit_ snack crackers, _Wisk_ detergent, _Kozy
Kitten_ cat food, _Reddi Wip, Ty-D-Bol_ toilet cleaner,
_Diet Rite_ cola, _Brite_ floor cleaner, _Star Kist_ tuna
and _Sun Kist_ orange juice, _Kool-Aid,_ Morningstar
Farms _Chik_ patties and nuggets, and _Kleen Guard_
furniture polish. Looking over that list, with its preponderance of words with the letter _k,_ I find myself
remembering something said by Willie, one of the
two old vaudeville comics in Neil Simon's play, _The
Sunshine Boys:_ &ldquo;Words with a _k_ in it are funny. You
didn't know that, did you? If it doesn't have a _k_ it's
not funny.&rdquo;

The pervasive use of the letter _k_ in the words
in the above lists substantiates this. Clearly the
names of the products are skewed to amuse the
consumer who, it must be assumed, with his good
nature invoked, will automatically respond by
favoring the product and thus buying it. I understand the premise, but personally remain unamused. I don't think it's because my sense of
humor is deficient. In fact, I've always had a weakness for anthropomorphism and find such things as
a gentrified peanut who wears a monocle, gloves,
spats, a silk top hat, and carries a cane, to be lethally amusing. but a name like _Reddi Wip_ makes me
wince rather than smile, and all of those ostensibly
whimsical _ks_ are no more entertaining to me than
a swarm of typos (the writer's blood enemy), which
is exactly what they resemble.

On the plus side of the matter, I was heartened
to observe while touring the aisles of a supermarket
that those products using the word _lite_ were outnumbered three to one by those using the original
spelling of the word. Like an explorer in an exotic realm, I encountered other sights ranging from the
fanciful to the outré. Contemplating Clamato
tomato cocktail, with its hybrid moniker that incorporates a misspelling, I thought of a passage from
&ldquo;Conversations With Helmholtz&rdquo; in Woody Allen's
collection, Getting Even: &ldquo;I explained to Dr.
Helmholtz that I could not order the Lobstermato
(a tomato stuffed with lobster) in a certain restaurant. He found that a particularly asinine word and
wished he could scratch the face of the man who
conceived it.&rdquo; An apt reaction, I think.

Elsewhere on the shelves I came across Olde
Tyme Stix, and marveled at the combination of
Chaucerian English and new wave word boggling. I
wondered how the crew behind Cap'n Crunch had
failed to give him a an alliterative k word name,
which seems more fitting for someone whose cargo
is sweetened corn and oat cereal in a box designed
to entice children. And I pondered the niceties of
ketchup vs. catsup, learning subsequently in my
etymological inquiry that ketchup is the proper
word, its misleading k notwithstanding.

There will be those who, reading this, think I
should liten up and go with the flow, so to speak.
But it isn't that I don't think language should be
playful, I just think that in its playfulness it should
exhibit the intelligence of a comedian like George
Carlin rather than the goofiness of a clown with a
putty nose and big shoes. Suppose the inclination to
blight the language in the way described were contagious and spread into other areas of usage. Imagine a literature that included titles like Long
Day's Journey Into Nite, Tropic of Kaprikorn, and
Lite in August. The next time you reach for a product whose misspelled name communicates its
meaning with all of the style of a drunk performing
with a hula hoop, then think about such a world and
tell me to liten up again.

### SIC! SIC! SIC!

Steve Reinders recently heard a WITI-TV
reporter in Milwaukee explaining that someone
&ldquo;... was murdered to death.&rdquo; (Some people just don't
know when to stop!)

## Famous Last Words
*Paul Bayliss, Liverpool*

I heard a story recently about a man who,
knowing that his days were numbered, wrote out a
speech to be delivered at his funeral. It was nothing
especially spiritual or philosophical, just a final
goodbye to friends and family. His best friend was
given the somewhat unpleasant task of delivering
what were, in many respects, last words from
beyond the grave. It has to be said, it must have
been a friend he could trust—he didn't have much
opportunity of a comeback if he was misquoted.
It seemed very odd to me but, more than that,
it seemed to me to be cheating. The utterance of
one's last words should be spontaneous and off the
cuff. The most famous last words manage to combine a stunning insight into the mysteries of life, combined with an element of well-timed humour.

Taking time to prepare beforehand rules out any
chance of delivering inspired words of heroism or
philosophical genius, or, even better than that,
words spoken with an element of tragic yet comic
timing. Just as it's always amusing to see people
falling over, it's always a pleasure to hear about a
stranger snuffing it in darkly humorous situations.
Many famous last words will, of course, be
apocryphal. Some will have been embellished
down the years while others will have been spoken
by the soon-to-be-departed hours or even days
before their final curtain. Others may never have
been said at all but, sadly, the person quoted won't
be able to defend him or herself. They'll just have
to live with it from beyond the grave.

Captain Oates'renowned words &ldquo;I am just going
outside and may be some time&rdquo; are recognised as
one of the most courageous final utterances.
Suffering terribly with gangrenous feet on Captain
Scott's doomed expedition to the South Pole in
1912, Oates had already asked his companions to
leave him behind and save themselves. They
refused to do so, but as he rose to leave the tent on
the morning of March 17th and made his heroic
announcement, his colleagues knew that he was
walking to his death.

There are many other examples of stoicism in
the face of the ultimate adversity. Roman gladiators would reportedly salute the Roman Emperor with &ldquo;Hail Caesar, those who are about to die
salute you,&rdquo; a remarkably generous tribute under
the circumstances, whilst the writer and politician
Erskine Childers kindly advised the firing squad at
his execution &ldquo;Come close boys, it will be easier for
you.&rdquo; Similarly, Joachim Murat, French cavalry
commander and king of Naples, said to the men
just about to pull the trigger, &ldquo;Soldiers, save my
face; aim at my heart. Farewell.&rdquo; Vanity to the last
and most probably in vain as well.

However for leniency in the face of outright
provocation, it would be hard to beat Richard I,
who offered forgiveness to the young man who had
just shot him with an arrow before ordering his
attendants to &ldquo;Take off his chains, give him a hundred shillings, and let him go.&rdquo; Young offenders
getting away with it even then.

Those who can inject their last words with a
touch of gallows humour deserve our utmost admiration. Voltaire, when asked to renounce the Devil, retorted quite succinctly from his deathbed, &ldquo;This
is no time for making new enemies,&rdquo; whilst
Anaxagoras, Greek philosopher and school-teacher,
will be revered by schoolboys everywhere for his
response of &ldquo;Give the boys a holiday&rdquo; when asked
did he have any final wishes.

It is, however, famous last words with an element of comic timing that prove to be the most memorable. Scottish essayist Thomas Carlyle's last
words were reportedly &ldquo;So this is death, well ...&rdquo;
Whether Carlyle was about to come up with a
memorable insight into death we shall never know.
It probably wouldn't have been as funny as the
words he managed to get out. In a more public
arena, John Palmer, the eighteenth-century English
actor, managed an inspired theatrical exit from this
mortal coil. Appearing on stage in the play The
Stranger, Palmer's last line, and indeed last words,
were the prophetic &ldquo;There is another world and a
better place.&rdquo; Little did he know that the other
world wasn't so much around the corner than a
couple of seconds away and hurtling straight
towards him.

It would take a fine effort to upstage Palmer's
impeccable timing, but politician Henry Temple
managed to do so, 67 years later. Obviously not
wishing to accept a particularly gloomy prognosis
from his doctor, Temple's last words, uttered with a
tragically ironic authority, were &ldquo;Die, my dear doctor? That's the last thing I shall do.&rdquo;

I've given some thought to my final verbal
offering to the world since hearing about this man's
funeral speech. As well as obviously hoping that
they will be a long way off, I've decided that, without resorting to rather unsporting preparation
beforehand, there's not a great deal one can do to
prepare those last words. Unless you're in front of a
firing squad or the like you're unlikely to know for
certain that this really, really is it.

I'd like to think my final words would be short
and sweet, to the point and tinted with an element
of courage. My personal favourite famous last
words are in fact a single word. Cicero, when faced
by his assassins, didn't mince his words. &ldquo;Strike&rdquo; he
said. They did. A famous last word.

*[Paul Bayliss is fresh from graduating in
Politics at Leeds University as a mature student.
His other love is cricket, a game that he plays, he
says, to a decidedly average standard.]*


#### EPISTOLA {William R. Harmon}

Enjoyed Pat Sheil's article, &ldquo;I before E.&rdquo;
But I guess they teach English a bit differently
down under. In an early grade in the early '30s in
deepest, darkest Wichita, Kansas, I was taught: &ldquo; _i_
before _e,_ except after _c,_ or when sounded like _a,_ as
in _neighbor_ or _weigh_ .&rdquo; Obviously the word _eight_
should be added to that short list.

*[William R. Harmon]*


#### EPISTOLA {James Lamb}

I wonder if any of your readers have knowledge
of examples of equivalent homonyms that pick out
a same class?

I have just one clear example so far, as illustration: the word acid. This word means substances
that taste sour and turn litmus red. Acids also corrode metals. But in modern chemistry acid means
'proton-donor.' Acids as proton-donors satisfy
exactly the same extensional conditions as as acids
as sour-tasting, etc.
This example is possible in virtue of the rise of
an explanatory theory able to account for the features of acids. But could there be examples that do not depend upon this?

I have a possible example: the word will. Will
can mean 'desire.' It can also mean a sort of personal power, namely to act, or bring about a bodily
movement. These senses, or the concepts
expressed, are not identical. But the extensions are
virtually identical, namely the actions in each case.
And this example does not hinge upon some theoretical superiority derived from modern science.

My point is, could there be a multitude of such
homonyms in English? If so no one seems ever to have noticed, the
question would surely be of interest to your readers
who in turn could probably furnish many examples.

## You've Got Game
*Gloria Rosenthal, Valley Stream, New York*

One of the joys of being a word person is converting others to word-personhood. Holidays are perfect opportunities to make word-lovers out of
your friends and relations through the giving of
wordy presents, especially exciting word games.

The following list includes &ldquo;brand new this
year&rdquo; games (marked *), &ldquo;within the last few years&rdquo;
games, and &ldquo;classics we love but need a reminder&rdquo;
games. I've played every game listed here so I know
whereof I praise.

Age categories are exactly as stated in the rules
(whether &ldquo;12 to adult&rdquo; &ldquo;12 and up&rdquo;, etc.). We've covered everything from stocking stuffers to eight days
of gifts. Please note that prices often vary from one
retailer to another, especially from these &ldquo;suggested
retail prices.&rdquo; To seek discounts, check toy and bookstores, or Google the name of the game and you will
be directed to company websites, _amazon.com,
boardgames.com,_ and more.

Here, then, are my favorite games grouped, not
by preference, but by price for your convenience.
These games made the list because they are eminently playable with easy-to-understand rules and
good packaging containing high-quality components.
A few games are not technically &ldquo;word games&rdquo; but
are related in a way sure to please &ldquo;wordy&rdquo; people. In
short, these are the games you want to grab when
somebody says, &ldquo;Let the games begin.&rdquo;

_Apples to Apples Crate Edition_* ; 12 to adult, 4
to 10 players, $29.95. New this year: an elegant
wooden &ldquo;crate&rdquo; of _Apples to Apples,_ a game where
players match characteristics on green cards to a
person, place, thing or event on red cards. The
beautifully crafted crate holds more than 1,000
cards from the original game and two expansion
sets. And _Apples_ is the only game where you can go
online and create your own cards that fit into the
game exactly like those already there. (I did it and
have a whole set on Broadway theater.)

_Oxford Dilemma;_ 12 and up, 2 to 6 players;
$29.95. One of two worthwhile spelling games on
this list. This one has a board, money, cards with three levels of spelling difficulty on each, bonus
words, a scholarship fund, and a dreaded Eight Ball
causing bankruptcy. But wait! You can stay in the
game by taking out a student loan. A variation of play,
when a player must first identify the word to be
spelled by its definition alone adds another dimension. So what two words fit this definition: a great game to give as gifts? All right, spell Oxford Dilemma.

*Quickword*; teen to adult, 2 or more players.
$25.00. Blue, green, pink and gray cards describe
each play. Colors determine the various challenges:
list all the words you can think of relating to a specific category (e.g. &ldquo;superstitions&rdquo;); write words for
six different categories beginning with the letter
indicated by a spinner; write words beginning with
the letter designated by the spinner, plus the letters
on the card, and more. Everybody ponders and
writes at the same time and every game is different,
depending on color, card, luck, skill and speed
(timer included).

VisualEyes*; 8 and up, 2 to 8 or more players,
$25.00. Can you see pictures of a smashed bottle
and a calendar page and think: &ldquo;broken date?&rdquo; Not
so easy when you're picking these images out of
eighteen different pictures on extra large dice, all
on view for all to see. You must make the connection before anyone else does, or before time runs out. A clock may represent hands, time, face, minutes, or hours but a doorway may not be accepted as enter. That's why VisualEyes is hilariously unpredictable. Each time you play, you see something
else in the dice. Part of the fun is discovering what
the pictures represent to different players. Play
nice, don't fight.

WordXchange, 10 and up, 4 players or 4 teams
of players, $24.99. Here we have lettered tiles,
white plastic racks (called easels ) on which to build
your words and an elegant black velvet bag to hold
the pretty blue tiles. You make words by putting
together letters from the board, the bag or opponents'easels and rearrange them, anagram-like. We don't normally condone lawlessness but the &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; feature in this game is fetching, in every sense
of the word. It is fun, brain-tweaking and fast (an
innovative, stand-up digital timer is watching you).
And it all comes packaged in a book-like box with a
magnetic closing. Neat!

_Wordrich*,_ all ages 9 to 99, 2 to 4 players,
$24.95. In my quest for new and different word
games I found _Word Rich_ and struck it rich. A
pouch holds letter discs in red (hearts), blue
(spades), green (clubs) and yellow (diamonds).
The gameboard has spaces for right-side-up discs
and face-down discs. Players try to make a word
by selecting one disc from the pouch and picking
letters from the board. Select a face-down disc for
bonus points but beware! There is a penalty for
not using a bonus letter once picked. Scoring is
slightly complicated but will soon settle in your
brain and have you striving for extra points in a
Basic Flush or a Royal Flush (both requiring letters in same suit and other requirements). You might call this _Scrabble_ meets poker.

_A TO Z;_ 8 and up, 2 to 4 players or teams,
$24.95. Each player has a plastic board with letters
of the alphabet from A to Z in place. The object is
to fill your board with chips as you call off names of
items in a specific category (determined by roll of a
die and cards). If you have to name things found in
a doctor's office, you would announce all you can
think of in that category such as nurse and magazines, and cover the _n_ and _m_ on your board. Time of
each move is determined by another die and 15 or
30 seconds is clocked on a—take warning!—noisy
flip-over timer. You might roll other choices; cover
any single letter or remove chips from another player's board, foiling a near win, perhaps. Fill your card and Bingo! (Oops! wrong game), you've won.

_Imatchination;_ 10 to adult, 2 to 6 teams, $24.95.
Take the word _life,_ for example, a word the die
&ldquo;told you to play&rdquo; so you write every phrase you can
think of (in time allotted): _that's life; life of the party,
get a life._ It's fun and easy. But—there is often a
&ldquo;but&rdquo; in word games—you and your teammate must
match each other exactly to gain the right to move
on the board; three matches = three moves. There
is some leniency: _Los Angeles_ and _L.A._ are matches,
but not _erase_ and _eraser_. Make those matches, earn
those moves, reach that finish line.

_Syzygy,_ 9 to adult, 1 to 12 players, $24.95. If
you've ever been tempted to construct crossword
puzzles, you might want to buy this game for yourself, as well as for gifts. Each player draws nine tiles and starts creating his or her own crossword. The first player to use all nine tiles yells &ldquo;draw!&rdquo; and all
players draw another tile to be added to their personal crosswords. Rearranging of letters is not only allowed, it is encouraged. The game proceeds until
all tiles are used and one player announces &ldquo;done!&rdquo;
Illegal words (as specified in most words games)
and misspelled words are removed and the player
with the least number of &ldquo;leftover letters&rdquo; is the
winner. This game is fast, furious and so much fun
there will not be a &ldquo;cross word&rdquo; spoken.

*Starters*, 8 to adult, 2 to 8 players and teams,
$19.99. Was there ever a word game where the
players received bonus points for the shortest
word? Well, there is now and furthermore, if the
words are of equal length, the word with more vowels is declared shorter. Each player starts with three
&ldquo;Starters&rdquo; (letter cards) and must write down the
shortest word using these letters, not necessarily
contiguous, but in the same order as drawn. After
the word is announced, another player can beat it
by coming up with a shorter word. Just for the fun
of it, what is the shortest word you can think of
using the &ldquo;Starters&rdquo; in this order: a g g? We think
you will be agog when you find an answer to that.

*Who Said That?** 2 to 6 adult players, $19.95
.Why are we including a game of quotations in an
article about word games? Well, really, what better
way to honor our language than remembering who
said what? This game features some of the best
quotes in entertainment, sports, the news, history,
politics and more! If a player correctly names the
source, he or she moves two spaces on the board.
If you're stumped, a hint is available on every card
with the loss of one space in your move for that
help. &ldquo;You're shagadelic, baby!&rdquo; is right there on
the box. Who said that?

*Couldju*, 12 and up, 4 or more players, $19.95.
&ldquo;Coodju&rdquo; spell uncouth backwards? How about
skipping every other letter in occasional? Other
spelling twists are: normal (go ahead, spell armadillo ), consonants only, vowels only, and more. The
toss of one die tells you how you are to spell the
word and the other gives you various point advantages. Cards list the five words you are to spell plus a bonus word and a one-minute timer keeps you
spelling. All right, now, spell &ldquo;I WANT THAT
GAME,&rdquo; vowels only.

_Buzzword*,_ 10 and up, 4 or more players in
teams, $14.99. In another game on the list,
_Imatchination,_ players are required to come up
with phrases relating to a certain word. Here we
have another variation on the theme. The buzzword is at the top of the card followed by ten clues,
each leading to a phrase incorporating that word. In
the case of the buzzword _apple,_ a clue is New York's
nickname ( _The Big Apple_ ). Scoring is done on an
erasable scoreboard, marker included, as is a sand
timer. Instructions tell you to &ldquo;give a hearty
Buzzzz!&rdquo; when time runs out, which is happening
right here. Buzzzz!

_Quiddler,_ 8 and up, 1 to 8 players, $12.99. Word
card games are great; at home, in bed (terrific solitaire here) on a plane, anywhere. Cards have letters, letters make words, players gets points. The
first round starts with three cards per player and
each round adds another card to your hand until
you're playing with ten cards in the final round. The
calligraphy on the cards is very unusual, and the
rules state that &ldquo;The letters shown in the center of
the cards were inspired by Celtic manuscripts from
500–800 AD.&rdquo;

_Spill and Spell,_ 8 to adult, 1 or more players,
$11.99. The name says it all. Spill the dice out onto
the playing surface and spell words. But wait—do it
in crossword style while a timer is taunting you.
Scoring is quick and easy and longer words add up
to higher scores. Rules suggest a variation: pick a
category: sports words, slang words, movie titles,
even people you know. If your words fall into the
chosen category, the score is doubled for that word
(or words, if you're really hot!).

_A Play on Words*,_ 8 to adult, 2 to 4 players,
$10.00. All word card games are not alike! In this
game a _Challenge_ card dictates how many: (three
four-letter words) and what kind: _Pure_ (all in one
color) or _Mixed_ (at least two colors) are to be laid
down. The value of each card is listed on the card,
along with bonus points, and that's a plus when
adding up scores. The first player to play all the
cards in his or her hand also gets the points of
cards left in opponents' hands. An extra feature: a
score sheet is printed in the rules to be easily
copied. Make many copies. You will be playing
this game often!

*My Word*, 12 to adult, 2 to 6 players, $9.99.
My word! Here is yet another version of a word
card game, summed up in the opening of the rules:
Earn points by quickly finding words from Letter
Cards being dealt to the center of the table. Calling
out words as cards are landing on the table makes
this game unique and keeps the brain continually
perking. They call this &ldquo;Fast and Fun Wordplay.&rdquo;
Take our word for it, it is.

*PDQ**, 8 and up, 1 or more players, $9.99.
We did not think another word card game would be
different enough to include but we were wrong.
Three letter cards are dealt and all players (at the
same time) try to think of words using those letters,
in the same order, left to right or right to left (which
in itself is unique and adds to the brain tweaking).
First player to shout out a correct word keeps the
cards, which count in scoring. There are excellent
variations and we really NJY this game!

Old favorites:

*Scrabble Deluxe*, 8 to adult, 2 to 4 players,
$29.99. You know Scrabble (unless you're from
another planet), but this deluxe version, with a
rotating turntable, is a glorious &ldquo;new&rdquo; gift. Also,
Scrabble Folio (travel) 8 to adult, 2 to 4 players
$19.99. Everything you ever wanted in a Scrabble
set to take with you in a great compact version.
Scattergories, 12 to adult 2 to 6 players, $22.99.
Another category-naming game has players making
lists (TV shows, breakfast foods, etc) of words starting with the same letter determined by a spin.

*Taboo*, 4 or more players, 12 to adult $22.99.
Can you describe the contents of this article without saying: word, game, gift, price, players? In
Taboo you must convey the card's Guess Word
without using any of five taboo words.

*Upwords*, 2 to 4 players, ages 10 to adult,
$12.99. If you ever wished you could place a letter
on top of a Scrabble word to change, e.g., groom to
broom, play this game where you create new words
out of words already on the board.
There must be something in this list for everyone on your list—and perhaps a few that you'll hint for, as well.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: [*Rogue Scholar: The Sinister Life and Celebrated Death of Edward H. Rulloff*](https://www.amazon.com/Rogue-Scholar-Sinister-Celebrated-Rulloff/dp/0472113372)
Richard W. Bailey, (University of Michigan Press, 2003), xii + 281 pp.

Edward Rulloff thought that he was a genius,
and so did many of those who met him, among
them some of the most learned nineteenth-century
Americans. His brain weighed in at 59 ounces, at
&ldquo;the higher ranges of normal,&rdquo; a posthumous
embarrassment; but it was big enough to contain
the mind of a philologist alongside the mind of a
murderer. Rulloff's life was incredible—or, it was
until Richard W. Bailey's thorough, precise, judicious, and utterly absorbing book made it credible,
not least as a walk along the fine line separating
learning and morality.

Arthur Conan Doyle's Moriarty illustrated the
same theme. Moriarty was the genius behind all
organized crime; Rulloff's crimes weren't particularly well organized, which is why he spent so much
time in prison. Rulloff was a thief, murderer, and
fraud: he murdered his wife and child, then spent
his life on the run; he stole to survive, murdered
again in the course of botched robberies, and pretended to be anyone but himself, moving from place to place in perpetual incognito.
But there was truth to the fraud. When he wasn't breaking the laws of God and man, he studied languages and philology, as well as medicine, engineering, and the law. He studied without the benefit
of much formal education, but his learning was
immense; when he represented himself as a university graduate in search of a teaching position or professorship, as he did on many occasions, he seemed
credible enough, until someone recognized him as
the infamous fugitive Rulloff, as someone always did.
In the end, he didn't fool anybody, partly because,
paradoxically, he wasn't fooling. His compulsive
genius might as well have been a fingerprint.

Some thought that Rulloff's philological work
was mere subterfuge, an attempt to escape justice,
but others defended him. In the _New York Tribune,_
Horace Greeley supposed that Rulloff &ldquo;was driven
logically into crime by his love of learning,&rdquo; since
philology doesn't pay the bills. Samuel Langhorne Clemens, in the same paper, regretted that Rulloff's &ldquo;vast capabilities for usefulness should be lost to the world ... For it is plain that in the person of Rulloff
one of the most marvelous intellects that any age
has produced is about to be sacrified ... Here is a
man who has never entered the doors of a college
or university, and yet, by the sheer might of his
innate gifts has made himself such a colossus in
abstruse learning that the ablest of our scholars are
but pigmies in his presence.&rdquo; Rulloff agreed with
Clemens. He was writing a philological work on the
scale of Casaubon's Key to All Mythologies. Like
Eliot's character, he died before he could complete
it and present it to the world as justification for all
that had gone before. He hoped to sell his masterwork for $500,000, sure that someone would buy it because knowledge, even philological knowledge, is
power. Theft was merely a stopgap, a series of
advances he couldn't wrangle from a publisher.

Crime aside, Rulloff was as dedicated a teacher
and scholar as any on record. During one incarceration, he taught local children languages while shackled to the floor of his cell. The family with
whom he lodged in New York City noted his obsessive study of comparative philology more than once. He worked on his book almost to the moment
of his execution, depending on a library donated by
those sympathetic to his cause. The motivation
behind decades of toil and trouble was fame. He
achieved fame, of course, but even considering
Bailey's account, as a criminal, not a scholar.

In a desperate attempt to survive long enough to
finish his book, Rulloff asked that prominent philologists examine his work and affirm that it was worth the wait, even if waiting meant justice delayed. Most
of them didn't understand what he was up to. He
sought William Dwight Whitney's endorsement, but
there's no record that he received it. From what we
know of Rulloff's philology, though, credentialed
scholars who weren't confused by his theories were
likely to disagree with them.

Rulloff was a constructivist, that is, he believed
that language is a human artifact, not God's prefabrication. He followed an anthropological tradition in language studies best exemplified in James
Burnett, Lord Monboddo, in which all current language is assumed to have derived from an original language, the &ldquo;language of Adam.&rdquo; Properly understood, current languages could be used to reconstruct the original language and &ldquo;unlock the mysteries&rdquo; contained therein. The original language,
that is, had magical powers worth at least $500,000
to anyone with the key.

Rulloff did not follow Sir William Jones,
Rasmus Rask, or the Brothers Grimm, however:
he ignored the comparative method they developed, as well as its crowning achievement, the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European. And
while Whitney was drawing philology inexorably
towards Saussure, Rulloff subscribed to principles like the following: &ldquo;In language formed upon this plan, words are not merely arbitrary signs.
They are signs, each of which is specially and
appropriately significant. Their significance
depends upon certain artistic relations, everywhere pervading their structure.&rdquo; Rulloff's system allowed etymological deductions almost impossible to comprehend: &ldquo;With the return of Bacchus from India, the letter R was brought into Greece, and was there employed in the application of language. The introduction of that letter was one of the most important events in the history of the
human race&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;From _amictus,_ 'clothing,' is
derived directly, _tunica, tunic,_ and this affords,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;a beautiful illustration of his method.
Thus we take from the first word the letters _t, u,
n, i, c, a._ These all being found here, the _n_ of the
second is plainly substituted for the _m_ of the first,
both being liquids.&rdquo;

As Bailey points out, &ldquo;Rulloff's 'method' was
absurd, but no more improbable than some of the
ideas proposed by respectable scholars in
respectable places.&rdquo; Rulloff's &ldquo;model of language
invoked the sacred,&rdquo; much as did Noah Webster's:
Webster also scoffed at the &ldquo;New Philology&rdquo; and
was thus enabled to trace nearly every American
English word back to Chaldean. And near contemporaries of both, like Ralph Waldo Emerson, proposed theories of language and culture consistent
with the language of Adam myth.

It's too bad that we know so much _about_
Rulloff's manuscript, but can't consult it. Wrong as
he may have been about the nature of language and
the processes of language change, something good might have come from it. While Rulloff wanted the language of Adam for its magic, others who sought
it cared more about disambiguation, the one-to-one
correspondence of word and referent. In the quest
for disambiguation, circa 1614, a university educated fellow invented logarithms, instead. Who knows what unexpected benefits might have accrued from
Rulloff's method and conclusions? But without the
manuscript, Rulloff's legacy is one of crime and
sensation, not philology.

No brief review can capture the intricacies of
Rulloff's life and thought, let alone the world's
response to them, as described in Bailey's excellent
book. While mediocre scholars remember to look
under boulders and the best among us leaves no
stone unturned, Bailey is a prospector and pans
every imaginable source for golden facts.
Beautifully narrated, unimpeachably informed,
historically relevant, simultaneously critical and
sympathetic, and artfully written, Bailey's book is
worth its weight. Rogue Scholar is more than a
biography: it considers family history, social history, literature, language, educational history, capital
punishment, crime, and justice. Its subject is sine
qua non; so is the book.

When Governor John Hoffman refused to
intervene in Rulloff's execution, Rulloff reportedly
said to his lawyer, George Becker, &ldquo;I shall be
remembered long after Governor Hoffman is forgotten. He will be remembered only as a scheming politician; I as the author of one of the grandest
theories on the formation of languages. You and I,
Becker, are the two greatest men of the age. I am
great on philology and you are of great weight.&rdquo;
Rulloff wasn't, after all, one of the great men of his
age, but at least, thanks to Richard W. Bailey, he is
remembered and, at least partially, according to his
own estimate.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: [*The Hidden Language of Baseball: How Signs and Sign-Stealing Have Influenced the Course of Our National Pastime*](https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Language-Baseball-Sign-Stealing-Influenced/dp/1496214633)
Paul Dickson, (Walker & Company), 230 pages.

Once it became clear, back in its nascent days,
that baseball had evolved from a &ldquo;gentlemen's
game&rdquo; to a rough-and-tumble, win-at-all-costs competition, overt attempts at communication within
the team went out the window. Managers were
challenged to develop methods by which they could
communicate with their players without the opposition knowing what they were up to.

Paul Dickson, author of several distinctive volumes on the national pastime including _The New
Dickson Baseball Dictionary,_ explains the history,
strategy and chicanery of this &ldquo;art form&rdquo; in _The
Hidden Language of Baseball._
    
Thanks to the intrusive nature of television, it's
relatively easy for fans nowadays to get a glimpse of
the intricacies of intra-game exchanges. The catcher
waggles his fingers in various configurations to tell
the pitcher what to throw. The third base coach goes
through similar, if not as hidden, gyrations to pass on
instructions to the batter. Infielders prepare their
defensive alignments on the basis of open- and
closed-mouth signals. The next time you see a close-
up shot of a conference on the mound, it's likely the
players will be hiding their mouths with their gloves;
you never know who might be trying to read lips.

While the rules forbid television monitors in
dugouts, there's nothing to keep a team from having one of their employees watching the tube from a luxury box and conveying information.

Dickson notes there are thousands of individual
signals (including those from the umpires) displayed
in any given game, many of which are mere camouflage, a &ldquo;beard&rdquo; for the real strategies. One of the
biggest &ldquo;no-nos&rdquo; a batter can do is to &ldquo;peek&rdquo; down at
the catcher in an effort to discern what pitch is coming. Many a harsh word (occasionally followed by
fisticuffs) has transpired from such a faux pas.

While the art of sign stealing—&ldquo;breaking the
code&rdquo; to find out what the opposition is doing—is
acceptable, there are limits, writes Dickson. It's fine
to have the players on the bench study the opposition for &ldquo;tendencies.&rdquo; It's considered &ldquo;cheating,&rdquo; on
the other hand, to stash someone in the scoreboard with a set of binoculars and a &ldquo;telegraphic&rdquo; device
to relay such information to the dugout.
One such accusation involves one of the most
famous home runs of all time—Bobby Thompson's
miraculous home run which gave the New York
Giants the National League championship over
their archrivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, more than
fifty years ago.

As the golden anniversary of the event
approached, Hank Schenz, an infielder acquired by
the Giants in midseason, claimed that on orders of
manager Leo Durocher, he would sit in the Polo
Grounds scoreboard and send signals to the dugout
via an electric buzzer to relay the catcher's calls to
another confederate who would then pass along the
information to the batter at home plate. Schenz
stated that Thomson was the beneficiary of such
information right before his &ldquo;shot heard round the
world,&rdquo; an assertion Thomson denied.
Interestingly, it seems such skullduggery
occurred more often a generation ago than it does
today. One would think, with all the modern methods of &ldquo;snoopery&rdquo; that the reverse would be the
case, but Dickinson's examples are mostly from
times gone by.

In keeping with his position as baseball's reigning lexicographer, the author offers a detailed glossary of &ldquo;signs, signals and tip-offs.&rdquo; In his chapter
&ldquo;Notes on How to Really Watch as Baseball Game,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;[T]he key to picking up signals at the
ballpark is to watch the players, not the ball.&rdquo; The
ball moves only when put in motion by others. The
players, on the other hand, are always on the move.
Pre-game meetings go over how the day's pitcher
will ply his craft and how the fielders will position
themselves accordingly.

The Hidden Game of Baseball is full of anecdotal information on the mental aspect of the sport which, while perhaps less dramatic than the physical prowess of the athletes, is nonetheless crucial to
a successful team.

### BIBLIOGRAPHIA: [*Mighty Fine Words and Smashing Expressions: Making Sense of Transatlantic English*](https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Fine-Words-Smashing-Expressions/dp/0195157044)
Orin Hardgraves, (Oxford University Press, 2003), 305 pp.

Long before the spot of unpleasantness known
as the Boston Tea Party, American English was busily diverging from its British parent. The current differences are not such that a New Yorker is likely to
identify the Queen's English as the language spoken
by cross-dressers at a Wigstock festival, but they still
amount to material for a good book.

_Mighty Fine Words and Smashing Expressions_
is that book. Orin Hargraves shows that, apart from
their slang, Americans are more euphemistic than
the British, more politically correct, less ridden
with class and other inherited distinctions and, as
befits their country's global reach, more effective in
distributing their coinages. Each country has
matching prejudices: British English can seem
snobbish to Americans, American English philistine to Britons. In fact, Hargraves' book in some ways is less about language than it is about culture.

As an American lexicographer who has lived
extensively in England, Hargraves is well-qualified to
deal with culture shock. A less generously reciprocal
and informative author might have spun out some of
the more colorful words and expressions into a few
wryly humorous chapters. Not so Hargraves, whose
book is crammed with data, including, by my count,
116 tables. Some of the tables are encyclopedic, not
lexical, but either way they're so useful that they
could ably serve a native speaker who couldn't care
less about what's said or done across the pond.
Among several appendices are credible overviews of
Australian, Canadian, Indian, Irish, and South
African English. Another appendix lists idioms and
expressions which take the cake (or take the British
biscuit), and gives enough material to make the reader roll in the aisles (or fall about laughing.)

&ldquo;About&rdquo; points to Hargraves's excellent discussion not only of that word, but of parts of speech,
including countability of nouns and inflections of
verbs. He advises that &ldquo;Americanizing editors can
usually do no wrong in systematically changing
_which_ to _that_ in defining clauses of British English,
judiciously avoiding the transformation when euphony would dictate the use of _which_ .&rdquo; His coverage of
words is frequency-based, and he does not include archaic, obsolete, and dated terms, and most slang
and informal usage. Fair enough, but one important
topic has gone AWOL. He does not discuss pronunciation, &ldquo;which is, in the end, a technical subject, and
for the most part has little bearing on comprehension of the written word.&rdquo; Not so fast. Most people
hear and speak many more words than they read and
write, and it would have been rewarding to have the
author's acute ear and dry wit applied, for example,
to the speech habits of ABC versus BBC anchors.

Reading Hargraves' book, one can amuse oneself
by imagining a surreal alternative planet in which the
lexicon would entirely consist of the most cryptic,
ambiguous, or hilarious names and terms in
American and British English. A diner orders Buffalo
wings followed by spotted dick, a homemaker washes dishes with a J-cloth and Fairy liquid, a letterwriter addresses envelopes to ME, IN, and MO as
well as to Beds, Bucks, and Wilts, a driver in a semi
hits a sleeping policeman, a batter grounds out and
then is out Leg before wicket, in each case resuming
a fielding position as a backstop or just silly, and a
stage-door Johnny decides to knock up an old friend.

These are mainly words for country-specific
things, but there are also lots of different words for
the same thing: an American pharmacist is a British
chemist, a British shopwalker is an American floorwalker. Yet for all the differences it's arguably true
that, thanks to television satellites and the Internet,
American and British English are closer than
they've ever been. One thinks of the language
reforms that Noah Webster is famous for— -or and
-er spellings rather than - our than -re ones, for
example—and how they commend themselves on
the grounds of concision and sensible phonetics.

Yet there is something to be said for the quirks and
vagaries of British English as a corrective to an
oppressively rationalized and homogenized world.
Full disclosure: Hargraves consulted me on
points of Canadian English, and thanks me in his
book. As a Canadian and hence suffering with
DPLS (Dual Personality Language Syndrome), I
can attest that his is a mighty smashing book to have
on a nearby shelf.

### EX CATHEDRA

Readers who devoured _The Professor and the
Madman_ (in the UK, _The Surgeon of Crowthorne)_
won't hesitate to pick up Simon Winchester's latest,
_The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford
English Dictionary_ (256 pages. 2003. Oxford
University Press. ISBN 0198607024. $25). As
always, Winchester manages to make a engaging
page-turner out of whatever he turns his hand to,
and the story of the _OED_ is no exception. He
sketches the huge cast of characters (from the brilliant but somewhat socially insecure Murray and the eccentric Furnivall, down to the uneducated but
deft-fingered slip sorters Miss Skipper and Miss
Scott) so well that it's easy to keep them straight,
and he manages to illuminate the interesting by-thebys of the enormous project (such as the internal politics of the Press and one editor's extended
sojourn in Chicago) without losing hold of the main
progression—and all this without the benefit of
being able to arrange his book in alphabetical order.
Truly a must-read for word fanatics, and a marvelous gateway book for those not yet fanatics.

An unusual present, for those of you still making your lists and checking them twice (or at this point, storing up ideas for next year), would be
Lawrence Paros' _Bawdy Language_ (263 pp., 225
illustrations. 2003. Kvetch Press. ISBN
0967200520/hardcover $26.95/0967200539 paperback $16.95). Not for children or the easily shocked, this book, subtitled &ldquo;Everything you
always wanted to do but were afraid to say&rdquo; is a collection of frankly salacious and obscene language,
amplified with attractive, if often lewd, margin
illustrations and quotations. Two indexes, one of
persons and works, and one of topics, plus a large
bibliography, make this more than a curiosity. Trust
me—that person on your list who has everything
doesn't have this. If you're afraid of having such
material sent through the mails (and aren't coming
from behind a prissy electronic firewall) log on at
_[http://www.bawdylanguage.com](http://www.bawdylanguage.com)_ for more material,
including games and links to associated sites.
If your bedside table pile includes Bierce and
Mencken, you'll want to add Maggie Balustreri's
_Evasion-English Dictionary_ to the stack. (150 pp., Melville House Publishing). It's a pleasurable skewering
of evasive language (even when it's your evasions
that are the ones, like, being skewered), done with
such gorgeous logic and good humor that you feel
the terrible urge to read bits of it out loud to those
nearest and dearest to you. Ignore that urge and
give those near and dear their own copies.

If you have children in whose lives you play the
role of book-giver, you'll be encouraged to learn that
the late William Steig's classic, _CDC?_ is now out in a
new color edition. (64 pp., 2003. Farrar, Straus &
Giroux. ISBN 0374312338. $16.00) _CDC?_ is, of
course, a series of Steigian drawings with alphabetic
captions; the fun is in deciphering the captions. It's
harder than it looks, and funnier, too. (&ldquo;F-N U N-E
D-¢-C?&rdquo; illustrated by a woman yelling a man
strolling by in his underwear eventually resolves into
&ldquo;Haven't you any decency?&rdquo;)

_Virent Ova! Viret Perna!!_ (72 pp., 2003.
Bolchazy-Carducci. ISBN 0-86516-555-6. $22.50)
is the latest Latinization of Seuss by those indefatiguable translators, Terence and Jennifer Tunberg,
husband and wife professors in the Department of
Classical Languages at the University of Kentucky.
If your Latin is rusty, the Seuss in question is _Green_
_Eggs and Ham._ There's a helpful guide to reading
the verses and a glossary, and the drawings are the
originals. The verse, too, keeps the bouncy Seussian
sound that is as much a character in his books as the
ingratiating Sam.

Early in 2004 we are hoping to expand our website to include an annotated bibliography of essential
books for word-lovers. In or out of print, old or new,
if you have a favorite you'd like to evangelize, please
send word of it to us. Please include the title, author,
and publisher, and the edition and date if known or
essential. We already have a comprehensive list of
dictionaries and other standard references. (In other
words please don't send us mail suggesting that we
put the _OED_ or the _Century Dictionary_ or the _Word_
_Menu_ on the list, don't worry,we've got 'em!) We are
hoping to find the hidden treasures and word-of-
mouth wonders. Please share yours!

If you have other suggestions for our website,
please let us know. We are still working on the com    plete linked and clickable online index and on having
a SIC! of the Day email or RSS feed. Other ideas are very welcome.

One more note: we only accept books for
review in VERBATIMthat are directly related to
language. Although this is a fuzzy criterion, please
do not send us novels, books of literary criticism,
translated works for which language learning is not
the main purpose, teachers' guides, workbooks, or
directories. Some of these works are quite expensive (and heavy!), and we cannot return them.
