(Gell-Mann named the first three.)  All six\nare what he and others in the field call “flavors.”  But flavors\nalso come in “colors.”  Recently, another pioneer in subatomic\ntheory, Sheldon Glashow, has begun thinking and\nwriting about “the smelly force” [<em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, August\n1984].  If its existence is confirmed by further research, it\nwill become the fifth of the elemental forces in the universe,\njoining the four already accepted by theoretical physicists—\ngravity, electromagnetism, weak force, and strong force.</p>\n<p>After flavors, colors, and smells, can touches and\nsounds be far behind?  Perhaps future issues of <em>Physics Today</em>\nwill bring the answer.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
