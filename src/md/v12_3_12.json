With the help of a leading expert on paroemiology, Mr.\nEmanuel Strauss, of Redhill, in Surrey, I have been led to\nvarious sources relating to <em>Nine tailors make a man</em>.  The\n<em>OED</em>, for instance, reveals that “In proverbial and allusive\nphrases, [tailor is used] often implying disparagement and\nridicule.”  The citations that follow are a mixed bag:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1605 SHAKS.  <em>Lear</em> II. ii. 60, <em>Kent</em>.  A Taylor made thee.\n<em>Cor</em>.  Thou art a strange fellow, a Taylor make a man?\n1607 DEKKER <em>Northward Hoe</em> II, i, They say three\nTaylors go to the making up of a man, but Ime sure I\nhad foure Taylors and a halfe went into the making of\nme thus....  1651 CLEVELAND <em>Poems</em> 23 Like to nine\nTaylors, who if rightly spell'd, Into one man, are\nmonosyllabled.  1663 BUTLER <em>Hud</em>.  I. II. 22 Compos'd of\nmany Ingredient Valors Just like the manhood of nine\nTaylors.  1819 SCOTT <em>Let</em>. 26 July in Lockhart, They say\nit takes nine tailors to make a man—apparently, one is\nsufficient to ruin him.  1908 H. B. WALTERS in <em>Church\nBells</em> 96 'Nine tailors make a man,' is <em>said</em> to be really,\n'nine tellers,' 'tellers' being the strokes for male, female,\nor child, in a funeral knell or passing bell.  3×3 for\nmale.  [In Dorset these strokes are said to be called\ntailors: <em>Acad</em>.  II. Feb. 1899, 190/1.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The one omitted at the ellipsis, preceding CLEVELAND, is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1625 B. JONSON <em>Staple of N</em>.  I, i Believe it, sir, That\nclothes do much upon the wit,... and thence comes\nyour proverb, the Tailor makes the man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It doesn't seem to belong with the rest; indeed, it seems to\nhave to do with <em>Clothes make the man</em>, and I can discern\nnothing disparaging in the citation; moreover, the entire\nthing seems a non sequitur.</p>\n<p>In <em>A Shakespeare Word-Book</em>, Routledge 1908, John\nFoster offers (in part), following a passage from <em>A Midsummer\nNight's Dream</em>, II, i, 54:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The term tailor is locally employed for a <em>bungler</em>, a\n<em>botcher</em>, or a <em>clumsy fellow</em>, and these meanings have\nbeen suggested in the passage quoted.  But as, according\nto the old saying, it takes nine tailors to make a man,\nmight there not be some allusion to Puck's <em>size?</em>  Hence\nthe expression may be equivalent to <em>mannikin!  dwarf!\nmite!  urchin!  elf!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this gallimaufry of Gongorisms, I sort out the following,\nwith Mr. Strauss's help:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(a)  Tailors were considered worthless fellows who were\nlikely to steal cloth from the bolts given to them by customers.</p>\n<p>(b)  <em>Nine tailors make a man</em> (note—not <em>the</em> man) means\nthat because tailors are worth so little (and are a cowardly\nlot, besides), it would require nine of them to make up\none “real” man—though why nine and not seven or eleven\nremains a mystery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>1.  The use of nine tailors in the Sayers title very likely comes\nfrom the <em>teller</em> use for bell.  This seems to be borne out by a\ncitation under <em>teller</em> in the <em>OED:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>b.  A thing that makes known or announces.</p>\n<p>...1877 <em>N.&amp;Q</em>. 5th Ser. VII, 164/1 At Frisby and\nelsewhere these tolls [for the dead] are called 'tellers'.\n1898 TYACK <em>Bk. about Bells</em> 1.8 The use of bells as tellers\nof the passing time.  1909 DEEDES &amp; WALTERS <em>Ch. Bells\nEssex</em> 149 We now come to the uses of the tellers,—for\nwhich the normal custom is 3 × 3 strokes for a man, 3 × 2\nfor a woman, including children, usually both\nbeginning and end of tolling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>The Nine Tailors</em> were bells in Sayers's novel, and I am\nreasonably sure that, had I been able to lay my hands on a\ncopy of it, I would have found there the sort of documentation\nshe was in the habit of providing.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
