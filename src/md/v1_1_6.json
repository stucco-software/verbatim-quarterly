I hope I\nwon't be interfering with the smooth flow of linguistic\nhistory by writing this note.</p>\n<p>Back in the dim mists of ages past when my wife and I\nwere young and reckless we were walking along the sandy\nshores of Lake Michigan, just enjoying the early summer\nday and picking up pebbles and stones. We felt their\nsmooth roundness and admired their varied subdued\ncolours. Feeling the smooth odd-shaped ones we mused\non the Chinese habit of holding nice jade lumps just for\nthe fun of feeling them; <em>hand jades</em> they called them,\ndidn't they? So we discovered you could also feel and\nstroke yourself with an <em>eye jade</em>, just right for the eye\nsocket, or a <em>nose jade</em>, cool along the nostril, or a funny\nhorseshoe <em>wrist jade</em>. We ended up the day taking home\na nice longish waisted <em>foot jade</em>.</p>\n<p>Splendid for resting your arch on the floor of the shower;\nwe've had one in our shower almost ever since. When I\nsit and write or type I like to set my foot or both feet on\na <em>foot jade</em>. This past autumn, arriving in Aberystwyth for\na year of writing and research, my daughter Julijana soon\nappeared from a walk along the sea front and the beach\nwith a fine grey <em>foot jade</em> which she presented me with;\nI'm comfortably propped on it right now.</p>\n<p>And just the other day it happened again, for about the\nfourth time. My 7 year old son Alexander and his friend\nChris were playing here near my table. “What's that?!”\nsaid Chris in his fine clear Welsh-English tone. “Oh,” said\nI, “It's a sort of stone that you can keep, a nice clean one\nyou know, that you can put under the table, or anywhere,\nthat you can put your...” Alexander, who often gets\nimpatient with the deficiencies and ignorance of Chris who\nis after all more than 6 months his junior, interrupted me\nwith crisp finality: “Why Chris, that's just a foot jade.”</p>\n<p>Nothing more was said until the next subject shifted the\nconversation.</p>\n<p>—Eric P. Hamp, University of Chicago, Aberystwyth, Wales</p>",
