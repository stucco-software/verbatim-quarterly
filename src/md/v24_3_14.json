(The word <em>orphan,</em> incidentally, is age-based; only children can be orphans.)</p>\n<p>A generation ago, linguists were infatuated with the Whorfian hypothesis that suggested that each language served as a grid on the world. A semantic hole such as this one would surely have been anomalous. That it would be universal would be inexplicable. It is hard to imagine a greater emotional impact than the death of a child. How could a culture ignore such an obvious linguistic need?</p>\n<p>The explanation is not obvious. A lawyer friend tells me that in both criminal and civil cases, the courts routinely refer to 'surviving parents,' which suggests that legal considerations may in fact be relevant. Widows and orphans have legal rights that require precise resolution, surviving parents and siblings less so, So it seems that semantic holes in general, and this one in particular, bear on general theoretical questions of some interest.</p>",
