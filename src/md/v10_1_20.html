<p>When Bill Cosby appears for Coca-Cola on TV, he derides
the competition for engaging in “taste tests” and “challenges.” He implies that Pepsi and Royal Crown Cola still have
to prove that people really prefer the way they taste.  For the
nation's number-one soft drink, however, there is no such need
for demonstration: “Coke is the real thing.”</p>
<p>Why does no one think to ask what the thing is that Coke
purports to be?  Because, to borrow from Roland Barthes, the
ad employs mythical language that uses Coke as an empty
signifier and then fills the significance with evidence of the
product's authenticity.  It awards to Coke the status of a
“predicative nature.”  Thus the only suitable response to the ad
that dresses its claim in the guise of truth is simple acknowledgment,
silent acquiescence.  Of course, Coke carries with it the
memory of the other functions it has served.  It has acted as a
socializing agent for those who “shared a Coke and a smile.”  It
has even been presented as a force for world peace, as in the
Christmas card commercial that shows young people from
different cultures holding candles and coalescing into a single
living tree, whose parts come together “in perfect harmony.”
Barthes writes of the character of the mythical concept that it
“appears in global fashion, it is... the condensation... of a
certain knowledge.”  So as a product that has absorbed its own
advertising history into the mythical status it enjoys, Coke is
freed from the need for self-description.  Everybody knows
what Coke is.  “Coke is it.”</p>
<p>Viewers of massive amounts of television advertising function
alternately as readers and decipherers of the myths they
are exposed to.  They feel they are inoculating themselves
against the efficacy of the medium by presupposing a lack of
artistic merit in the presentation of the message.  As Jeffrey
Schrank observes, “the personally immune... consider most
ads silly...and generally a waste of time....  The problem is
that the belief in personal immunity from the influence of
advertising is the... group's greatest weakness.  A person who
believes himself... immune will not take defensive actions,
will not protect against exposure.  The result of this weakness is
a hidden susceptibility.”  [Jeffrey Schrank, <em>Snap, Crackle, and
Popular Taste</em>, New York: Dell, 1979, pp. 84-85.]</p>
<p>This presumed immunity exists most often with regard to
advertising conventions that are so familiar to the viewer that
he imagines any reading of them as entailing a demystification
of the product claim.  Thus the buyer feels that beneath the
statements the advertisement makes he can see an advancement,
an insinuation of the sponsor's own self-interest.  This
recognition of the commercial's motivation discredits the commercial's
message, he thinks.  The meaning is that it is the
advertiser's advantage that is furthered by the product's sale,
not the consumer's.  Commercials that lend themselves most
readily to this kind of cynical decoding emphasize the performance
of the products they propose.  Their language, even when
self-serving, is informational and transitive, explaining what the
product does, unlike the metalanguage of myth, in which the
product is defined, revealed for what it is.</p>
<p>The most effective of these action-focused ads attend less
to the transmission of the message than to its reception by the
viewer, less to causes than effects.  They depict an ameliorated
state of things already brought about by the product's purchase
and consumption.  Hemorrhoids shrunk, carpet clean, glasses
spotless, headache gone: the mythologist of the language of the
television ad often finds verbal actions in commercials instantly
resolved into a set of statal adjectives.  Thus the slimness of the
models in the ads for diet soft drinks presumes a history of
their product use.  Fat adult men and women are never seen
consuming on TV the colas that are light or free or the beers
that are less filling.  Only adolescents with fast metabolisms are
shown partaking of the calorie-laden sodas of other, sugared
brands.</p>
<p>There are also products meant to work on problems that
arouse such anger in consumers that it is not the absence of an
evil but the forcefulness of its eradication that interests viewers
in the ad.  Rodents, germs, insects, dirt, and pain: the penetration
of the consumer's body, clothes, or home is a prospect so
distasteful that he takes at first for granted his exemption from
all illnesses and infestations.  But when he finds himself a
victim, his shock and indignation are relayed by the shrillness
and intensity of the advertising message.  “Ralph, we've got
rats!”  a distraught housewife screams in horror to her husband,
and at that point, no product is too violent, no ad too loud in
offering a cure.  Frequently personified by sneering animated
figures, these nuisances require harsher treatment from the
sufferer than their benevolent removal.  They invite a retribution
as unpitying as the scouring corrosiveness of bathroom
cleansers and Listerine's medicinal astringency.  In matters of
soil, vermin, and discomfort, the product's own combative
energy is transferred to the buyer.  As Patricia Neal for Anacin
asserts, “The world belongs to the fighters.”</p>
<p>In the interest of giving further proof of the competence
and power of these products, the ads must also tell how far the
problem they will remedy can otherwise ultimately spread.  One
rat or roach detected in a home betokens hosts of others out of
sight, behind the floorboards and in cellars.  Only d-CON can
definitively purge the rodents; insects must be treated with the
aggressive redundancy of Raid, which “kills bugs dead.”  A
simple tension headache may escalate into one that only
analgesics of maximum arthritis strength can root out and
destroy.</p>
<p>Unlike ads that document a buyer's satisfaction with
merchandise he used some time before, the commercial for a
pain reliever or detergent will stress its working now.  Barthes
allows that advertisements like those for the French soap
powder Omo, which frees the garment of its occupation by oily
ground-in dirt, to some extent still indicate the performance
and effects of the product.  But chiefly, he observes, they
“reveal its mode of action;... they involve the consumer in a
... direct experience of the substance, make him the accomplice
of a liberation rather than the mere beneficiary of a
result.”  These ads will therefore show the product “acting
things” more than they will celebrate its understood
achievements.</p>
<p>Even in commercials that concentrate on praxis, one can
see how language often functions as the medium by which the
results that one desires are finally attained.  Instead of having
famous personalities or actors explain how well the product
works, the advertisement confers a certain volubility upon the
symptom the item claims to cure.  Thus nagging backaches can
be silenced by Doan's pills and tell-tale odors squelched by
Carpet Fresh or Glade.  Sometimes the enemies of consumers'
peace of mind are invested with an ability to talk, only to be
drowned out, overpowered by the higher volume of the speech
with which the product is endowed.  “Want a tough stain out?”
one bleaching agent asks.  “Shout it out!”</p>
<p>Clearly, though, most commercials try conferring on their
products the status of myth, so the merchandise they sell, like
Band-Aids, Sanka brand, or Kleenex, acquires an absolute
generic fullness and identity.  When asking for a product, the
consumer cannot even name the competition, thereby consigning
it to a state of nonexistence.  If, as Barthes contends,
myth is a kind of language robbery, then the theft that takes
place in an ad is that of language as prospective buyers use it
to identify and then describe the goods that they have chosen.
This appropriation of evaluative language from consumers
takes place most basically and first of all on the level of the
product's name.  Thus when asking for Good and Plenty candy
from a movie house concessionaire, the patron cannot help but
state that in each box he discovers quality and that it is
abundant.  Such instances of language usurpation by the product,
in which to name an object is to praise it, are too
numerous to mention.  In past years, however, the function of
television advertising language as a manner of doxology has
extended to whole sentences as well.  (Gregor Goethals explains
that while advertising involves a trivialization of the sacred, it
uses the same methods practiced by religion, only substituting
commercial values for spiritual ones.  “This transformation is
accompanied by a metamorphosis of both images and faith:
from gods to goods, from salvation to soaps.”  [Gregor T.
Goethals, <em>The TV Ritual: Worship at the Video Altar</em>, Boston:
Beacon, 1981, p. 138.])  In this way, the I Can't Believe It's A
Girdle girdle addressed the skepticism of the queen-sized
woman who wanted to be comfortable and shapely all at once,
as did the Support Can Be Beautiful bra.  Gee, Your Hair Smells
Terrific shampoo went so far as to elaborate on the declarative
remark contained in other product names and made of it the
end point of a dialogue, an exchange with an imaginary person
whose compliments attested to the benefits the product
claimed to bring about.  Today cats run up the stairs to talk on
telephones and win pet food contest prizes by giving answers
their owners are too ill-informed to know.  But, as with their
human counterparts, the repertory of their sounds and recall of
brand names is limited.  They are echoes of the advertising
messages they have previously witnessed and are therefore
reduced to asking for Meow Mix since there is nothing else that
they can say.</p>
<p>In ads for products that pretend to the status of myth,
there is meant to be an adequacy between the signifier and the
signified, between a product and the satisfaction its use
allegedly delivers.  Because of this relationship, consumers are
intended to infer that no other brand will do, that the fullness
of the advertising message can be extended to the commodity
itself.  Yet sometimes the product's value outdistances the
expressiveness of the language that describes it.  Thus shoppers
are informed that “Safeway is everything you wanted in a store
and a little bit more.”  On the other hand, the item's action
may itself include a verbalizing of performance standards that
still transcend the words used to convey them.  “The Pine Sol
signal says more than clean.”  As with the lengthiness of brand
names made into testimonials, there is an overflow of meaning
here as well, so that advertising language must admit its
inability to say how good the product really is.  It is this that
Barthes describes as “the silent garrulity of myth.”</p>
<p>While much in advertising still relies on the numbing
repetition of rhyming slogans and incantatory jingles, there are
other spots where messages are hushed, their speech intentionally
muted, the better to elicit the interest of a mass of jaded
listeners.  “If you want to catch somebody's attention,” a Coty
commercial used to say, “Whisper.”  And in fact it is most often
in the advertisements for perfumes that the language is lightened
by a certain airiness.  Its message ventilated by the
agreeable elusiveness of meaning, the speech already can be
seen becoming rarefied to suit the nature and the substance of
the product.  In the end the messages are vaporized, suffused
with a faintly sweetened vagueness so that they waft into the
subconscious and permeate it with their soft mnemonic power.
“I can't seem to forget you,” a lover haunted by the memory of
his woman's scent recalls: “Your Windsong stays on my mind.”</p>
<p>Long saturated by the prolixity of ads that told of the
advantages of product use and promised satisfaction with
results, the consumer allows himself to be more open to
commercials that work simply on the level of an invocation.
Henceforth he becomes the reader of a metalanguage that does
not “act the things,” as Barthes declares, but rather “acts their
names.”</p>
<p>Already in commercials for Windsong and Chanel, for
Essence Rare, the message was subtilized, expressing a need for
less expression.  Unlike the ads that rhapsodized over what their
products did, these others began evincing a convenient manner
of amnesia.  They have consciously and willfully forgotten their
own explanatory history, their obligation to define an item as
better than the other leading brands, because the buyer cannot
help remembering the product's name and apparent value.  The
advertisement takes the vicious world in which a product has
to fight the competition for its rightful market share and then
subjects it to the magic language of myth.  It in turn creates an
image “that comes out of myth as a harmonious display of
essences.”  As merchandise comes closer to attaining to this
privileged, exalted state, the commercials become ever more
laconic, their language marked by growing signs of complacent
reticence.</p>
<p>In 1983 a television ad for Michelob consisted of several
close-up shots of beer being poured slowly into glasses.  Each
was crowned by an ample head of foam, and the whole piece
was accompanied by majestic strains of music.  At the end, a
man's voice delivered the only line of text in the ad: “Some
things speak for themselves.”  From the plenary language of
commercials that state a product's name as proof of its
naturalized superiority, there is but a short step to the commercial
from which speech is altogether absent.  Consumers' participation
in the ad becomes a manner of commemoration, in
which the only thing remembered is the evidence of the
timeless excellence of the products.  Myth takes things, Barthes
avers, and “purifies them,... makes them innocent... gives
them a natural and eternal justification,... a clarity which is
not that of an explanation but... of a statement of fact.”  The
economy of language in television ads, therefore, depends upon
its having only to reinforce an earlier consensus, to take a
product whose goodness it posits as already acknowledged, and
then assert again that it is good.  The purpose of the ad is to say
the things that go without saying.</p>
<p>This substitution of essential speech for more operational
speech can be found in almost every ad that reveals its product
at the same time it envelops it in the mantle of myth.  It is
language as disclosure, articulated in a variety of figures, from
the false antithesis of Parkay margarine that says it isn't butter
to the tautology of the soft drink ad that says that Coke is
Coke.</p>
<p>When products start to talk in place of salesmen, one can
be assured that they will soon be talking less, their need for
explanation beggared by a meaning that is both ineffable and
obvious.  The product has assumed the value of an icon whose
cause for veneration has long been lost in the eternity of its
established value.  Ideally the ad need only re-present a logo,
reiterate a name in its performing of the liturgy of orthodox
consumerism.  Having raised the product to the level of myth,
the ad can then depict a world that “wallow[s] in the evident,
... establishes a blissful clarity,” whereby things, like
Michelob, “mean something by themselves” [Barthes].  In the
end, the nation's best-loved products are sold in commercials
where the meaning of the item is enriched by the impoverishment
of the language that describes it.  Speech then verges on
the brink of silence, as sponsors and audiences alike concede
that, in the context of the ad, their words are superfluous and
insufficient all at once.  Thus <em>TV</em> ads use language whose sole
function is to celebrate its own exhaustion.  They say Budweiser
and then declare, “When you say Budweiser, you've said it
all.”</p>
