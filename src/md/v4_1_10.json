In\nmost languages <em>left</em> has unpleasant associations.</p>\n<p>In English, <em>left</em> has associations of political radicalism.\nIt also means 'abandoned.' <em>Left-handed</em> means 'unflattering,\ndubious, insincere.' <em>Right</em>, on the other hand, means 'correct,\ngood, or proper.'  The German words <em>links</em> ('left') and <em>rechts</em>\n('right') have similar meanings.</p>\n<p>In Latin, the word for <em>left</em> is <em>sinister</em>.  Sinister connotes\n'evil, cunning, scheming.'  The word for <em>right</em> is <em>dexter</em>, from\nwhich derives our word <em>dexterous</em>, meaning 'skillful, clever,\nor artful.'</p>\n<p>In French, <em>gauche</em> means, besides 'left,' 'awkward, tactless,\nclumsy, lacking in social grace.'  <em>Droit</em>, 'right,' has the\nusual meanings of 'correct, good, and proper,' and also means\n'law.' Even more to the point is that <em>gauche</em> means the same\nas <em>maladroit</em> ('bad right').  In German, <em>linkisch</em> means 'maladroit.'\n<em>Gouache</em> also refers to a school of painting in which\npaint was piled high on the canvas.  It was considered ugly\nand in bad taste.</p>\n<p>In Spanish, too, <em>izquierda</em> ('left') has the same unpleasant\nconnotations, including political radicalism, and <em>derecho</em>\n('right') means 'law,' as it does in French.  The same is true of\nthe Portuguese words <em>esquierda</em> and <em>derecho</em>.</p>\n<p>In no language does the word for <em>right</em> have these unpleasant\nconnotations.  The languages seem to have conspired\nagainst the left-handed of the world.  Everything from can\nopeners to golf clubs is designed for the right-handed.  The\nsingle exception seems to be the typewriter, the keyboard of\nwhich favors the left-handed.  Perhaps Christopher Sholes,\nits inventor, was left-handed.</p>\n<p>One suspects there is a sinister plot by the linguists.  We\ncan speculate about the reasons for this moral distinction between\nleft and right.  The political difference comes from the\nhabit in France and Germany of Communists sitting on the\nspeaker's left in Parliament, and Fascists sitting on the\nspeaker's right.  Another reason may be that left-handed people\nwere considered peculiar, perhaps victims of some evil\nforce.  Until quite recently it was thought best to retrain left-handed\npeople.  They often became clumsy as a result.  A doctoral\ndissertation concluded that serious psychological consequences\nfollow from this retraining.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Clearly, the word <em>left</em> has been dealt a left-handed blow.\nIs this right?</p>\n<hr>\n<h2></h2>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-b2\">\n<p>Dra.
