Cassidy</span> <span data-rel=\"location\"></span></em></p>\n<p>This old exclamation, probably dating centuries back, had a sudden vogue in the late eighties and early nineties when the sports fraternity latched on to it and spread it everywhere through radio and television. The best translation I have heard is, 'Watch out! Hell's about to break loose!' It will suit a lot of occasions, domestic, political, military and of course those critical moments in sports. It means threat and tension; beyond that nobody seems to care. <em>Katie, bar the door!</em> But where does it come from? Like many long-ago happenings, nobody thought to make a permanent record. Those who knew the story—in this case a heroic one—had no way to keep it in memory except by folk tales and songs. But these may not get written down, and the tellers and singers may have no successors. So, great deeds of the past are ultimately forgotten, the remnants distorted or no longer understood. Who was Katie? When, why, how did she bar the door? The following tale is pieced together from obscure and scanty sources, with some logical surmise.</p>\n<p>King James I of Scotland, a strong man who drew a number of chieftains together under him, strengthening the kingdom, naturally aroused rivalry and enmity, which led at last to his assassination in 1437. This was accomplished in an outbuilding to which the King had retired with members of his court for recreation. The assassination had been carefully planned: the bar had been removed from the door, and when the murderers attacked, it could not be found. One of the guests, by legend Lady Katherine Douglas, thrust her arm through the staples where the bar should have been, and temporarily kept the door shut. The King took refuge in a lower room, but ironically, the outer door had been recently sealed by his order. The Lady's arm was broken, the murderers rushed in; the King defended himself but was outnumbered and killed. But the lady's heroic deed was told and sung: she became “Kate Barlass”—the lass who barred the door. That is the legend, but I have found no written record of the song nor anyone who can sing it. “Katie bar the door” must have been a refrain or a line of verse. We may guess that as the King's company realized they were under attack, the men looked to their swords, and one of the other ladies shouted to Katie, who finding that the bar was not there, did the best she could think to do. A noble woman and a noble deed. And the shout became a dire warning of imminent danger.</p>\n<p>The last part of the tale? Katie and her story must surely have been brought to America and sung in some of the Scottish settlements in Appalachia, made mostly in the 18th century. Many of these old ballads have survived to the present; this one, as we put it together, must at least have made current the warning <em>Katie, bar the door!</em> And out of the hills some hill-born singer coming north introduced it there, perhaps directly into the world of sports and sportscasting. But nobody has written down the facts, or if written, they lie hidden in obscure places. And historians of language, lexicographers, need records too. Is it now too late to track our surmises back to facts, to recover the missing pieces of Katie's story? The <em>Dictionary of American Regional English</em> is now editing the letter K. Lady Katherine deserves to be honored in memory once again, “as all good folk agree.”</p>\n<p>Information would be welcomed by the Chief Editor at 6125 Helen White Hall, 600 N.
