Voc</em>. in Wr.- Willcker 282/6\n<em>Melle dulci</em>, leoht beor.  (<em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>)<br>\nc 1000 <em>Sax. Leechd</em>. III. 122 Drince leoht wyn.\n(OED)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Currently, however, many a denizen of the United\nStates regards <em>light</em> (also spelled <em>lite</em>) as a label that\nindicates that a beer is lower in calories than its nonlight\ncounterparts.</p>\n<p>and <em>Khrushcheff</em> or <em>Khrushchoff</em>.  I have seen both the\n<em>-ov</em> and -<em>off</em> transliterations on the same page of a\nbook.  The reason for this variation is that when the\nCyrillic letter that represents our English <em>v</em>-sound is\nfinal in a word, as in the nominative case for\n<em>Gorbachev</em>, it is unvoiced and sounds like <em>f</em> (or <em>ff</em> for\ngood measure); when an inflectional ending is added,\nas in <em>Gorbacheva</em> (the genitive case), that same letter\nis voiced, like <em>v</em>.</p>\n<p>Such variations in transliteration are practically\nendless, and hardly any variation can be called an\nerror, though consistency is obviously desirable.  The\nmost troublesome inconsistencies in transliteration\nseem to be owing either to the human tendency to\nconceal doubt behind abundance or to multiple naturalizations\nas the name migrates across Europe.  For\ninstance, in English the name of the Russian composer\nis usually spelled <em>Tchaikovsky</em> and sometimes as\n<em>Tschaikovsky</em> or <em>Tschaikowsky</em> where three or four\nEnglish letters are used to represent a sound represented\nby a single Russian letter and more normally by\nonly two in English, <em>ch</em>.  The name <em>Chaliapin</em> was first\ntransliterated into a French spelling <em>Chaliapine</em>; later,\nwhen most of the family moved to the United States,\nthe <em>e</em> was dropped to Anglicize the spelling.  This was a\nconfusing half measure, however; the initial <em>ch</em> remained\nas in the French spelling, representing a Russian\nletter borrowed from the Hebrew alphabet for the\nsound represented in English by <em>sh</em>.  As a result, many\nAmericans innocently mispronounce the name of the\ngreat operatic bass and his descendants.  A certain Tennessean,\nwho became a good friend of Boris Chaliapin,\nthe <em>Time</em> cover artist, got off on the wrong foot\nwhen he heard the artist's name as <em>Charley Apin</em>.\nSince Boris was too polite to correct the Tennessean,\nand others who knew better found the mistake too\namusing to rectify, that one American friend called\nBoris <em>good ol' Charley Apin</em> as long as the friend lived.</p>\n<p>The roots of the 'reduced calorie' meaning of\n<em>lite/light</em> go back to 1967.  In that year Meister Brau\nInc. of Chicago initially marketed Meister Brau Lite, a\nreduced-calorie beer.  Women were targeted as the primary\nconsumers; but the beer, which was promoted as\na diet drink, was not very successful.  In 1972, Phillip\nMorris, Inc.'s Miller Brewing Co. acquired the <em>Lite</em>\nbeer label in a buyout of Meister Brau Inc. Miller Lite\nwas introduced to test markets in 1973; and the first\nLite commercial, which featured Super Bowl hero\nMatt Snell, aired in July of that year.  The tenth Lite\ncommercial, which featured linebacker Dick Butkus,\nwas shot in May 1975 just as Miller Lite was going\nnational.</p>\n<p>Miller Lite commercials were designed to convince\nyoung males that it is all right to drink light beer.\nConsequently, these commercials, which, according to\nVideo Storyboard Tests Inc., are among the most popular\never to be shown on television, have featured former\nathletes (e.g., Bubba Smith, Bob Uecker, and Rosie\nGrier) and celebrities (e.g., author Mickey Spillane,\ndrummer Buddy Rich, and comedian Rodney Dangerfield).\nThe original theme of these commercials was:\n“Everything you always wanted in a light—and less.”</p>\n<p>During the early years that Miller was convincing\nthe public that tough guys do drink light beer, other\nbreweries remained skeptical.  Because they thought\nlight beer had a wimpy image, they stayed out of the\nlight beer market for a while.  When other breweries\nfinally did enter the market, most of them used the\nspelling <em>l-i-g-h-t: Bud Light, Coors Light, Michelob\nLight, Natural Light, Old Milwaukee Light, Stroh\nLight</em>.  The reason for this was simple enough: Miller\nBrewing Co. owned the trademark <em>Lite</em>, which it had\npurchased from Meister Brau Inc. in 1972.  However,\nbrewer Paul Kalmanovitz, owner of Falstaff Brewing\nCo. of Omaha and General Brewing Co. of Vancouver,\nWashington, challenged Miller's exclusive right to\n<em>Lite</em>.  In July 1982, a U.S. District Court jury in San\nFrancisco ruled that <em>Lite</em> was just an alternate spelling\nof <em>Light</em>.  As a result of this decision, <em>Lite</em> may now be\nused on the label of any beer to indicate that it is a\nreduced-calorie beer.</p>\n<p>According to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> (April 20, 1988)    light beers represent approximately 22 percent of\nthe $13 billion beer market.  The popularity of reduced-calorie\nbeers has resulted in the inclusion of the following\ndefinition of <em>lite/light</em> in <em>The Random House Dictionary\nof the English Language, Second Unabridged\nEdition</em>: <em>“13.</em> (of alcoholic beverages)... (esp. of beer\nand wine) having fewer calories and usually a lower\nalcohol content than the standard product.”</p>\n<p>Not all light beers are created equal, however.\nSome have fewer calories than others: Michelob Light,\n134 calories per 12-ounce serving; Stroh Light, 115;\nBudweiser Light, 108; Miller Lite, 96; Pabst Extra\nLight, 70; and Pearl Lite, 68.  As we can see, Michelob\nLight has almost twice as many calories as Pearl Lite.\nIn fact, Michelob Light has one calorie more (i.e., 134)   than Heidelberg regular beer (133 calories).</p>\n<p>Since 1978, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\nFirearms has been involved in rule-making regarding\nthe use of <em>lite/light</em> as a label for alcoholic beverages.\nJim Ficaretta of the <em>BATF</em> has stated that, according\nto the current ruling, if <em>lite/light</em> in the sense 'reduced\ncalorie' is applied to a malt beverage, the label on that\nproduct must contain a statement of average analysis\nwith regard to calories, carbohydrates, fat and protein.\nIf <em>lite/light</em> simply describes a characteristic of\nthe beer (e.g., taste, body, color), no such statement is\nrequired.  The last word on this matter has not been\nwritten, however.  A decade after it first became involved\nin the <em>lite/light</em> issue, the <em>BATF</em>, with several</p>\n<p>proposals on hand, is still working on rule-making\nwith regard to the use of <em>lite/light</em> as a label for malt\nbeverages, wines, and spirits.</p>\n<p>The barons of beerdom are not the only merchants\nto have produced reduced-calorie ingestibles.  A\nplethora of reduced-calorie foods are also available for\nthe weight-conscious among us.  Where food products\nare concerned, however, no one has ever held the exclusive\nright to <em>lite</em>.  Therefore, both <em>lite</em> and <em>light</em> have\nbeen freely used in the names of products: e.g., <em>Prince\nLight Spaghetti, Aunt Jemima Lite Syrup, Thank You\nLight Pie Filling, Whitman's Lite Chocolates, Wonder\nLight Buns</em>, and even <em>Alpo Lite Dog Food</em>.  Such products\noften have one third fewer calories than their nonlight\ncounterparts, although that proportion might\nvary.</p>\n<p>Health-conscious Americans are concerned not\nonly with calories.  They also want less caffeine in their\ncoffee, less salt in their pickles, less sodium in their\nsalt, no sugar added to their canned fruits, and less tar\nin their cigarettes.  Consequently, those merchants who\npander to and even help create our wants and needs\nhave provided us with, to name but a few, the following\n<em>lite/light</em> products: <em>Manor House Lite Coffee</em> with\none third less caffeine than regular coffee; <em>Piper's\nFarms Lite Kosher Dills</em> with 50 percent less salt than\nPiper's Farm regular dill pickles; <em>Morton Lite Salt</em> with\nhalf the sodium of regular table salt; <em>Libby's Lite\nPears, Peaches, Mixed Fruits</em>, and <em>Fruit Cocktail</em>, all\nof which have no sugar added; <em>Pall Mall Light 100's</em>\nwith one third less tar than “the leading filter king-sized\ncigarette.”</p>\n<p>Gregory Weismantel, president of Manor House\nFoods, has stated: “<em>Lite</em> is perceived by consumers as a\nname of a product that has less of a negative ingredient”\n(<em>Chicago Tribune</em>, November 4, 1981).  His statement\nforeshadowed a new definition of <em>lite/light</em> that\nsix years later appeared in <em>Random House II</em>: <em>“12.</em> low\nin any substance, as sugar, starch, or tars, that is considered\nharmful or undesirable: <em>light cigarettes</em>.”</p>\n<p><em>Lite/Light</em>, when applied to a food, may refer to\nthe product's taste, color, or texture rather than to the\nnumber of calories or the amount of fat, salt, sugar, or\ncholesterol it contains.  For example, in 1982, Frito-Lay\nintroduced <em>Light Corn Chips</em>, which were thinner\nand crispier than Frito-Lay's regular corn chips but\nwhich had just as much salt and a few more calories\nthan the regular product.  In order to avoid confusion,\nFrito-Lay subsequently changed the name to <em>Crisp 'N\nThin Corn Chips</em>.  Not all manufacturers of food products\nare as concerned about customer confusion, however.\nRep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) has observed: “[Food\ncompanies] strain the limits of the English language\nand our patience by overusing words such as...\n<em>light</em>.  The more we distort the language, the less the\nconsumer can understand the product” (<em>Chicago SunTimes</em>,\nOctober 19, 1986).</p>\n<p>In an effort to shed some light on the use of\n<em>lite/light</em>, Rep. Cooper introduced in February 1986 a\nbill that would have limited the use of <em>lite/light</em> to\nproducts that have one third fewer calories, one half\nless fat, or three fourths less sodium than regular (i.e.,\nnonlight) products.  This bill was lost in the legislative\nshuffle, however, and, as of this writing (October 25,\n1988), has yet to be passed in spite of having been\nreintroduced in 1987 and 1988.  The bill, which, in its\ncurrent form, would require a product labeled\n<em>lite/light</em> to have one third fewer calories, one third less\nfat, or one third less sodium than regular, nonlight\nproducts, will have to be introduced once again in 1989.     Perhaps the fourth time will be a charm.</p>\n<p>Potables, comestibles, and smokables are not the\nonly products to bear the <em>lite/light</em> designation.  In\n1982, Hallmark introduced a series of greeting cards\nthat contained puns.  They were called <em>LITE</em> and were\ndescribed as being “a third less serious than regular\ngreeting cards.”  This description was, of course, an\nallusion to the solecism that has been used to promote\nMiller Lite: “Lite has a third less calories than their\nregular beer.”  In 1986, the Johnson's Wax people introduced\n<em>Glade Light</em>, an aerosol air freshener with less\nthan half the perfume of regular sprays.  In the same\nyear, Jhirmack introduced <em>Lite Shampoo, Lite Conditioner</em>,\nand <em>Lite Mousse</em>, which are designed to clean,\ncondition, and style one's hair without build-up.</p>\n<p>The use of <em>lite/light</em> has extended beyond product\nnames.  In such cases, the term may be used in a\ndescriptive sense to indicate that something is less intense\nthan its nonlight counterpart.  Often, however,\n<em>lite/light</em> is used humorously, or even caustically.</p>\n<p>Low-impact aerobics have been called <em>lite aerobics</em>.\nIn music, there are <em>Lite Rock</em> and <em>Lite FM</em>.  Book\neditor Henry Kisor used the term <em>Lite Mystery</em> to refer\nto a book “with only half the calories of a regular\nwhodunit” (<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, July 24, 1987).  Regarding\n<em>The Harvard Lampoon</em> parody of <em>USA Today</em>,\npublisher Joe Armstrong declared, “We're kind of like\n<em>USA Today Lite</em>” (<em>USA Today</em>, September 15, 1986).\n<em>Newsweek Lite</em> is what one critic called <em>People Weekly</em>\n(<em>Chicago Tribune</em>, January 20, 1988).  <em>Picture Week</em>,\nwhich died after two extensive market tests by Time\nInc., was called <em>People Lite</em> by some skeptics at Time\nInc. because the publication was designed for those\nwho think there is too much to read in <em>People (New\nYork</em>, January 6, 1986).  The television show <em>West 57th</em>\nwas called “CBS' lite news show” by <em>People's</em> TV critic,\nJeff Jarvis (<em>People Weekly</em>, September 9, 1985).</p>\n<p><em>Lite College</em> is what Stanley Mieses proffered the\nstudent who “seeks an education that is tasteful without\nbeing fulfilling [and] degrees [that are] based on a\ncurriculum that is one third less challenging” (<em>The\nAtlantic</em>, October 1983).  The <em>Lite Fight</em>, which consists\nof “a simple opener and a swift final blow,” is\nwhat columnist Judy Markey offered the couple who\nwant to save time with a pared-down version of the\n“fundamental, tedious, classic argument” (<em>Chicago\nSun-Times</em>, July 10, 1986).</p>\n<p>In the political arena, Gary Hart, who tried so\ndesperately to emulate the late John F. Kennedy, was\ncalled “the Kennedy lite candidate” (<em>Chicago Tribune</em>,\nJanuary 20, 1988).  Robert Dole had the title <em>New Dole\nLite</em> bestowed upon him because he was perceived to\nbe “less acerbic [and] more personal [<em>sic</em>]” than he\npreviously had been (<em>Time</em>, November 16, 1987).</p>\n<p>A metaphor for our time.  That, according to some\nbehavioral scientists, is what <em>lite/light</em> has become in\nthe years since the first Miller Lite commercial aired in\nJuly 1973.  These concerned sociologists and psychologists\nmaintain that we Americans want not only beer\nthat is low in calories, cigarettes that are low in tar,\nand foods that are low in substances such as salt, sugar,\nfat, and cholesterol; we also want reduced-effort cures\nfor our ailments, reduced-work jobs, and reduced-commitment\nrelationships.  That is why these specialists\nin human behavior have declared the 80s to be the\n<em>Lite/Light Decade</em>.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
