This has passed into the\nlanguage as a synonym for 'drop out or fail' as, “He\n<em>crapped out</em> ('dropped out') from Bucknell in his freshman\nyear.  I was <em>aceing</em> ('getting a Grade of A in') a\nbiology course and then I got caught unprepared for a\nbatch of pop quizzes and crapped out ('failed').”</p>\n<p>Then there is the term <em>play the field</em>.  This comes\nfrom a section of the crap table where the numbers 2,\n3, 4, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are displayed.  Some layouts use\na 5 instead of a 9 and some pay double or triple on 2 or 12.  The term describes someone who is no longer dating\na particular person on a regular basis, but rather\nanyone on a random basis: “He was going with her,\nbut they broke up.  He's pretty depressed and doesn't\ngo out at all, but she is <em>playing the field</em>.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, there's the term <em>hard way</em>.  In craps this\nconsists of the numbers 4, 6, 8, or 10 made with a\npair, as an 8 with two 4's.  It is used to denote a difficult\nway of doing something, as, “The Mets were\nexpected to bear the Red Socks in 4 or 5 but they did it\nthe <em>hard way</em>” (i.e., in 7 games).</p>\n<p>One other term that I thought was used only in\nNevada has popped up elsewhere.  The game is Keno,\na relative of Bingo distinguished by its low price (one\ncan play for 70 cents) and long odds.  The odds for\nexample of catching 12 out of 12 spots are 500 million\nto one.  A Florida friend of mine used it to denote a\ncheap political shot, as in, “A lot of <em>Keno</em> shots ('cheap\nshots') were taken at Senator Paula Hawkens because\nof her neck injury.”  A friend in Massachusetts used the\nterm this way: “Pittsburgh has only a <em>Keno</em> shot at the\ndivision title next year,” meaning, of course, 'Pittsburgh\nat best is a very, very long, well-nigh impossible\nshot to win the National League East Title.'</p>\n<p><em>[John M.
