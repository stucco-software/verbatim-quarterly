These, however, were the easy ones and could be answered very briefly. When asked for the derivation of a word of which the etymology had not been worked out, he adopted a rationing system: he did the best he could with the resources available in his study in the space of half an hour.

Both sides of this lifetime correspondence are now in the possession of his granddaughter, Miss K. M. E.
