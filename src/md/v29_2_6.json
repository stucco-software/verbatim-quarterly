Agapi kai filia, Saïmon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what's the language? It seems to contain a few English words, such as <em>Helo</em> (sic) and <em>Bye-bye,</em> or perhaps the writer is showing off her English. Church-going readers may recognize <em>Agapi</em> but expect an <em>e</em> rather than an <em>i</em>. My name is Simon; why the odd spelling <em>Saïmon</em>?</p>\n<p>Well it's Greek, but not as we know it. And I'd better say at once that by “Greek” I mean “the language spoken by Greeks.” It's necessary to state what seems obvious because many people who ought to know better think “Greek” means “a dead language that used to be taught in some Northern European schools, and which bears a structural, but almost no phonetic, similarity to a language which was spoken two thousand years ago by a minority of the inhabitants of what is now called Greece.” At about the time of these two e-mails I read in the <em>Guardian</em> that something or other was “As outmoded as the Greek vocative case.” The writer evidently neither knew nor cared that the vocative case was in regular daily use throughout Greece, not to mention Cyprus, Sydney, and Camden Town. No wonder Greeks are so touchy.</p>\n<p>But surely Greek is written with another alphabet? Yes, but you can't conveniently tap out emails in other alphabets. Even if you always send your message as an attachment, you can't be sure that the recipient will have a Greek font in his computer, or even that the same keystrokes on one computer will give the same letters on another. Until everyone uses Apple Macs as God intended, sending Greek from one computer to another will continue to produce Double Dutch. Because of these difficulties, I've carefully avoided using any Greek letters at all in this article. What I really needed for my title was a word like <em>Alphabetocentricity.</em></p>\n<p>To overcome the problem, Greek users of email have developed a phonetic transliteration into the roman alphabet, resembling that used in phrase books for English-speaking tourists, whose writers are convinced, probably rightly, that English speakers would rather learn wildly incorrect pronunciations than another alphabet. The two alphabets are, after all, very similar, especially in the upper case; many Greeks, especially those less literary, like to keep the caps lock key firmly depressed. The trouble is, very often the letters only look the same; they don't sound the same. Beta, gamma, and delta, for instance, are pronounced not like our <em>B, G,</em> and <em>D,</em> but like, respectively, our <em>V,</em> something like our <em>Y</em> but with a slight closing of the throat, and like our voiced <em>TH.</em> Indeed, the pronunciation as <em>B, G,</em> and <em>D</em> is a staple of Greek cartoonists wanting to represent the barbaric <em>(varvariko)</em> speech of foreigners. Since no single letters represent these sounds in Greek, they have to use the diphthongs mu pi, gamma kappa, and ni tau.</p>\n<p>How does all this work for a Greek writing an email? Vaguely, and not very well. Take the word DIEYTHINSH from the first example. It's a transliteration of the Greek word for 'address,' and it's pronounced 'The eff sin thi,' the first <em>th</em> being voiced and the second not. Thus the <em>D</em> represents a Greek delta, the <em>EY</em> the Greek vowel digraph epsilon upsilon (which is pronounced, in this case, 'eff'), the <em>TH</em> represents a Greek theta, and the final <em>H</em> represents a Greek ita, one of Greek's many <em>i</em> sounds. In this last case <em>H</em> is used only because it happens to look like an upper case ita.</p>\n<p>What about the odd spelling of my name? Well, Greek has no single letter that can represent the <em>i</em> in <em>Simon</em> pronounced the English way. It must use the alpha sound followed by the iota sound. But the alpha iota vowel digraph is pronounced like the <em>e</em> in <em>end,</em> so a diaeresis is needed over the <em>i.</em> So when I'm writing an email to a Greek, but perforce using the English alphabet, I spell my name <em>Saïmon,</em> otherwise I tend to get called <em>See-mon.</em></p>\n<p>What about those <em>X's</em> in obviously unpronouncable places? Well they're not <em>X's,</em> they're chis. The Greek letter chi, pronounced rather like a German or Scots <em>ch,</em> happens to look, especially in upper case, just like an English <em>X.</em> Greek does have a letter (Anglophones call it <em>xi</em>) equivalent in sound to our <em>X,</em> but it doesn't look like any English letter. This is a source of confusion to most English users of Greek and vice versa, a confusion further confounded by the rise of Greek emailese.</p>\n<p>And the accents, or rather stress marks, that are such a feature of written Greek? Well, we just have to manage without them. Indeed, there's a move to eliminate them from Modern Greek, but I'm glad to say it's being resisted. One should always resist linguistic change: not because it's always a bad thing, still less because the resistance has a hope in hell of succeeding, but simply because by resisting it one gets people to think about language.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, Greeks, translators from Greek, English people with Greek friends, and so on, use Greek emailese without even thinking about it, and most of the time it works, more or less. Greek emailese is, I'm sure, going to cause unexpected changes in the Greek language, especially the written language. Like most linguistic change—think of non-adverbial uses of <em>hopefully,</em> or the use of “beg the question” to mean invite, rather than evade, the question—these changes will have been brought about by people who would claim no special interest or skill in language; they just want to talk to one another.</p>\n<p>Oh, I nearly forgot; the translations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Helo!! I wish you a quick recovery from what you had! My address is . . . . I'm waiting! Bye-bye. How are you Simon? I'm sorry for the delay in replying but I don't check my email very often. How are you and where are you now? I'm in Liverpool and studying like mad!!! Unfortunately I won't be able to come for the job; I have so much reading for the exams after Christmas and I have to work full-time in the restaurant!! But thank you anyway!!!I'm expecting your news soon, O.K? Many kisses.</p>\n<p>How's it going, my . . . ? As I promised, I've sent you a letter by snail mail. Love and kisses, Simon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2></h2>",
