It\noffers a case in point from one of the 17 volumes of <em>The\nLives of the Saints</em>, a massive work written between\n1872 and 1889 by Sabine Baring-Gould (1834-1924),\nthe English clergyman who is best remembered as the\nauthor of the hymn, “Onward, Christian Soldiers.”\nHere is what he had to say about Saint Cuthbert, an\nEnglish monk who became Bishop of Lindisfarne and\nwho died in the year 687:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No saint of his time or country had more frequent\nor affectionate intercourse than Cuthbert with the\nnuns, whose numbers and influence were daily increasing\namong the Anglo-saxons, and especially in\nNorthumberland.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wasn't quite sure about the clipping, so I checked the\nwork itself in our public library—and that's what it\ngives.  (Bearing-Gould, a compulsive writer, was a man\nof Victorian delicacy.  In one of his novels he mentioned\n“certain heavily-frilled cotton investitures of the lower\nlimbs” and elsewhere referred to “the bloomer arrangement\nin the nether latitude.”)</p>\n<p>Anyway, this sent me to the big <em>Oxford</em>, where I\nfound about a column-and-a-half on <em>intercourse</em>.  As a\nnoun it was first used of trade dealings between people\nof different localities.  Originally spelt <em>entercourse</em>, it\ncomes from the French <em>entrecours</em> 'commerce,' which\nis from the Latin <em>intercursus</em> (also 'commerce').</p>\n<p>Soon it came to denote 'communion between persons'\nand 'that which is spiritual or unseen.'  (I vaguely\nremember a hymn I heard, and perhaps helped sing,\nthat contains the phrase “intercourse divine.”)</p>\n<p>As early as 1806 the word was used with apparent\nsexual signification by Thomas Malthus, the parson\nand economist who is remembered for his <em>Essay on the\nPrinciple of Population:</em> “An illicit intercourse between\nthe sexes.”  But that use apparently was rare in those\ntimes.  I do not know when the word, standing alone,\ncame into common use with an explicit sexual sense.\nIn the 16th century the word was also a verb: 'to run\nthrough, run across.  To have intercourse <em>with</em>.'</p>\n<p>Now back to Cuthbert the saint.  Ivor Brown, in\none of his delightful books on words, <em>Random Words</em>\n(1971), writes that Cuthbert had been an honored\nEnglish name, but that somehow during the 1914—18\nwar it “ceased to be a name and became an insult” and\nwas used of slackers who evaded military service.\nBrown does not know how that happened.  This use of\nthe name as a derogatory noun is given in both the\n1933 <em>Supplements</em> to the <em>OED</em> and in the recent one.\nSeventy-two churches in Britain were named for Cuthbert.\n<em>Kirkcudbright</em> ('Church of Cuthbert'), the name\nof a small former Scottish county and its main town, is\npronounced “kir-KOO-bree”—which Brown reports is\nsaid by the natives with a “dove-like murmur.”</p>\n<h2></h2>",
