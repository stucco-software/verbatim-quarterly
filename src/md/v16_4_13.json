Considering all that I\nhave examined, I suggest the following background\nto a derivation:</p>\n<p>Around the time of World War I (before or\nright after), Greeks came in numbers to the United\nStates, settling mostly in the cities mentioned.  The\nterm <em>malakia</em> was commonly used in popular (i.e.,\nnot polite) speech, much like our <em>Don't give me that\njazz</em> or <em>Quit jerking me around</em>.  How did the term\nspread around the country, if indeed it did?  VERBATIM\nreaders may be able to contribute further suggestions\nand comments.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
