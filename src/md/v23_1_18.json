That is not to say that technique is not involved, merely to observe that some dictionaries are better than others because their editors are more literate, imaginative, poetic, and generally possess those attributes with which we associate art rather than technique or mundane craftsmanship. Such dictionaries, too, succeed because they establish a rapport with generations of users. It goes without saying that most of those drawn to lexicography, like those attracted to art schools, exhibit skills more likely to be associated with craft than with art; these days, far too few of those who work on dictionaries have a thorough grounding in literature, let alone the various specialties within linguistics—general and comparative studies, classical and modern foreign language study, phonetics, philology, etymology, to say nothing of lexicology and lexicography. The results are seen on the bookshelves of bookshops throughout the world: adequate but largely pedestrian bilingual dictionaries and a scattering of monolingual works that have been resurrected by greedy publishers who have engaged dryasdust editors to update out-dated, out-of-copyright dictionaries in order to make a fast buck.</p>\n<p>Lexicographic technocrats enjoy using terms like <em>terminology, terminography, LSP</em> 'language for special purposes,' <em>LGP</em> 'language for general purposes,' <em>lemma, lexeme</em>, and other words, reflecting the notion, long prevalent in psychology, sociology, and other social sciences, that if you can give a problem a name, you have somehow gone a long way toward solving it. This book, which consists of a series of chapters and subchapters, was written by a committee, which immediately tells the reader something about its likely consistency and continuity.</p>\n<p>It is true that the principles that apply to specialized dictionaries are not the same as those that apply to general dictionaries, either monolingual or bilingual. For one thing, the user of a specialized dictionary can be assumed to have a level of sophistication that includes knowledge of and some understanding of what goes on in general dictionaries. It takes the editors of the subject book several pages to make this point, which, it seems to me, is rather simple. Their explanation includes Venn diagrams (which, notwithstanding their utility, I thought had gone out of fashion a few decades ago) and other devices. It is hard to imagine that this book would be picked up by anyone but a lexicographer or someone interested enough in becoming one to subject himself to such a turgid presentation; in the event, one might assume a certain level of familiarity with the subject. Yet the treatment is reminiscent of Washington Irving's <em>Knickerbocker History of New York</em>, which—facetiously, at least—starts out with the creation of the world. If one doubts the turgidity of the style of this work, witness the following, which merely says that entries in a dictionary can be ordered in different ways:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The macrostructure of the word list should be understood as the arrangement of the lemmata occurring in the word list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is that the writing of a person to whom you would want to give the responsibility for explaining complex or unknown terms in simple language? A few sentences farther on, the writer offers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge of the alphabet implies that lemmata may easily be arranged and looked up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think I have dwelt on such shortcomings enough.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
