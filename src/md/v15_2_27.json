The problem was solved simply by\nusing an already standard character that had a similar\nsound to what the Viet called themselves.</p>\n<p>For example, the Chinese word for <em>Buddha</em> is used\nas the first character for the English word <em>Florida</em>.  Let\nme quote from Professor John DeFrancis's <em>The Chinese\nLanguage Fact and Fantasy</em> (p. 8):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Chinese were confronted with the problem\nof expressing foreign terms and names, as happened\non a large scale with the introduction of\nBuddhism in the first century A.D., they did so by\nfurther extending the use of Chinese characters as\nphonetic symbols.  The word <em>Buddha</em> itself came to\nbe represented by a character which at one time\nhad a pronunciation something like <em>b'iwat</em> and\nnow, after a long process of phonological change,\nis pronounced <em>fó</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems the character “fó” is being used phonetically a second time around in <em>Florida</em>.</p>\n<p>Let me emphasize “by further extending,” in the\nquote above.  My argument is not that the Chinese\npronunciation for <em>Viet</em> is “Yueh” but that Mr. Henn\nerrs when he translates the Chinese character as 'extreme.'\nThe Chinese character is simply a phonological\nrendering of a Viet word meaning 'people.'  The correct\ntranslation is the “Yueh (or Viet)” of the “south” (as\nopposed to the “Yueh” who used to be just beyond\npresent-day Shanghai).</p>\n<p><em>[Charles G.
