This report details some older and some more recent adoptions of English words into Chinese.</p>\n<p>The British empire's cannon and opium plus the United State's open-door policy forced open the Qing Dynasty's feudal gate. With the arrival of foreigners and foreign goods, English words began to spread first in port cities such as Guanzhou (Canton) and Shanghai. Some English words have entered these dialects, the phonetic translation sometimes being very homophonous, sometimes not. The Cantonese called:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>cent</em> <em>xian</em></p>\n<p><em>check</em> <em>chi</em></p>\n<p><em>quarter</em> <em>gu</em></p>\n<p><em>fashion</em> <em>hua chen</em></p>\n<p><em>stamp</em> <em>shi dan</em></p>\n<p><em>taxi</em> <em>di shi</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Shanghai, the Chinese called:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>stick</em> <em>si di ke</em></p>\n<p><em>gas</em> <em>ga s i</em></p>\n<p><em>cement</em> <em>shui men ding</em></p>\n<p><em>chocolate</em> <em>zhu gu li</em></p>\n<p><em>telephone</em> <em>de lu feng</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When western ideas of democracy and liberty were imported into Chinese in some literature, relevant English words were borrowed, for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>romantic</em> <em>luo man ti ke</em></p>\n<p><em>inspiration</em> <em>yian shi pi li cun</em></p>\n<p><em>democracy</em> <em>de me ke xi</em></p>\n<p><em>humour</em> <em>yu me</em></p>\n<p><em>international</em> <em>ing te nai xang na er</em></p>\n<p><em>ultimatum</em> <em>ai di mei deng</em></p>\n<p><em>bourgeoisie</em> <em>bu er qiao yia</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The famous writer Lusun in his prose entitled <em>Fe Er Pe Lai Ying Gai Huan Xing</em> used the phrase <em>fair play</em>; the title translates into <em>No Fair Play Now</em>. Another writer, Xia Yian, in his novel <em>Baoshen Gong (Contracted Children Workers</em>), used <em>Number One, name wen</em>, for the brutal foreman of the children workers.</p>\n<p>Of course, western science and technology exerted great influence on China, so that some scientific terms were borrowed into Chinese. Of 104 chemical elements, only about ten are direct meaning translations, such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Fe</em> <em>tie</em></p>\n<p><em>Cu</em> <em>tong</em></p>\n<p><em>N</em> <em>dan</em></p>\n<p><em>Pb</em> <em>qian</em></p>\n<p><em>Ag</em> <em>yin</em></p>\n<p><em>Hg</em> <em>gong</em></p>\n<p><em>H</em> <em>qing</em></p>\n<p><em>O</em> <em>yang</em></p>\n<p><em>C</em> <em>tan</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The others are all sound translations, such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Na</em> <em>na</em></p>\n<p><em>Ca</em> <em>gai</em></p>\n<p><em>Ba</em> <em>bei</em></p>\n<p><em>Mn</em> <em>meng</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most units of physics are sound borrowings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>ampere</em> <em>anpei</em></p>\n<p><em>watt</em> <em>wa te</em></p>\n<p><em>Hz</em> <em>hezi</em></p>\n<p><em>gram</em> <em>ke</em></p>\n<p><em>volt</em> <em>fute</em></p>\n<p><em>calorie</em> <em>ka lu li</em> or <em>ka</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some medical terms, especially the names of medicines, are borrowed directly from English words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>aspirin</em> <em>a si pi lin</em></p>\n<p><em>analgesic</em> <em>an nai jin</em></p>\n<p><em>rutin</em> <em>lu ding</em></p>\n<p><em>penicillin</em> <em>pan ni xi lin</em></p>\n<p><em>atropine</em> <em>a tu pin</em>.</p>\n<p><em>cocaine</em> <em>ke ka in</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some scientific terms were first borrowed with their original sounds; later, these sound-translations were dropped and new words were invented to carry the meaning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ENGLISH PHONETIC REPLACEMENT AND LITERAL</p>\n<p>WORD GLOSSES</p>\n<p><em>penicillin</em> <em>pan ni xi</em> <em>qingmei su</em> 'green fungus <em>lin</em> element'</p>\n<p><em>laser</em> <em>lai sai</em> <em>ji guang</em> 'exaggerated light'</p>\n<p><em>motor</em> <em>ma da</em> <em>dian dong ji</em> 'electric-powered machine'</p>\n<p><em>engine</em> <em>yin qing</em> <em>fa dong ji</em> 'a machine that can start another machine'</p>\n<p><em>microphone</em> <em>mai ke feng</em> <em>kuoin qi</em> 'sound transmitting device'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Readers may be more interested in the common words popular in standard spoken Chinese language in which there are some words directly borrowed from English:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>model</em> <em>moter</em></p>\n<p><em>sofa</em> <em>sha fa</em></p>\n<p><em>disco</em> <em>di si ke</em></p>\n<p><em>cocoa</em> <em>keke</em></p>\n<p><em>Coca Cola</em> <em>kekou kele</em></p>\n<p><em>pump</em> <em>beng</em></p>\n<p><em>nylon</em> <em>ni long</em></p>\n<p><em>cashmere</em> <em>kai si mi</em></p>\n<p><em>tank</em> <em>tang ke</em></p>\n<p><em>poker</em> <em>pu ke</em></p>\n<p><em>tango</em> <em>tan ge</em></p>\n<p><em>jeep</em> <em>ji pu</em></p>\n<p><em>chocolate</em> <em>qiao ke li</em> (standard; different from Shanghai <em>zhu gu li</em>)</p>\n<p><em>pound</em> <em>bang</em> (two written forms in Chinese standing for <em>British currency unit</em> and weight respectively, but of the same sound)</p>\n<p><em>Kentucky Fried Chicken</em> has changed into <em>kente ji: kente</em> keeps the sound of “Kentu,” and <em>ji</em> meaning 'chicken,' imitates the sound of “ky.” Chinese has no sound for /ki/; <em>ji</em> is a phonetic adaptation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>MacDonald</em> <em>mai ke tang na</em></p>\n<p><em>hamburger</em> <em>hanbao bao</em></p>\n<p><em>hot dog</em> <em>regou</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These terms are very popular in Beijing for the two restaurants were opened there. Even the modern American slang <em>cool</em>, 'excellent' has become Chinese:<em>ku</em>. The interjection word <em>wau (Wow!)</em> can be heard on radio or television. Chinese children, even in the countryside, say <em>bai bai</em> to their parents instead of <em>zai jian</em>.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that a Chinese writer called on the Chinese to invite “Mr. De” and “Mr. Sai” to China, <em>de</em> standing for <em>democracy</em> and <em>sai</em> for <em>science</em>.</p>\n<p>Some translations are most fortuitous both in sound and meaning: for <em>Coca-Cola, kekou</em> means 'tasty' and <em>kele</em> 'satisfied.' <em>Baishi kele</em> is <em>Pepsi Cola</em>; this translates into 'satisfied with everything.' There are occasional anecdotes created around the inevitable ambiguities that arise: one day an old country man heard one young fellow mention <em>disco</em>; the old man thought that the young man was to kick his dog to death, since <em>disco</em> sounds like <em>di si kou</em>, which sounds like <em>ti si gou; ti</em> 'kick' + <em>si</em> 'death' + <em>gou</em> 'dog.'</p>\n<p>Some of the borrowed words are formed with combinations of sounds and meaning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>car</em> <em>ka che: ka</em> repeats the sound of <em>car</em>, and <em>che</em> means 'carriage'</p>\n<p><em>card</em> <em>ka pian: ka</em> imitates the sound; <em>pian</em> means 'piece,' or 'page,' or 'card'</p>\n<p><em>carbine</em> <em>kabin qiang: kabin</em> imitates the sound of <em>combine; qiang</em> means 'gun'</p>\n<p><em>rifle</em> <em>laifu qiang; laifu</em> imitates the sound of <em>rifle</em></p>\n<p><em>butter</em> <em>baituo you: baituo</em> imitates the sound; <em>you</em> means 'oil' or 'grease'</p>\n<p><em>beer</em> <em>pi jiu; pi</em> imitates the sound; <em>jiu</em> means 'wine'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Chaplin's film <em>Modern Times</em> was translated into <em>Medeng Shidai</em>, a typical example of combination translation: <em>medeng</em> is a phonetic rendition of <em>modern; shidai</em> means 'times.' The Chinese word for <em>times</em> is very old; <em>medeng</em> is a new word.</p>\n<p>In semi-colonial China, because of the underdevelopment of science and technology, even some simple products such as nails, matches, colorful clothes, and soaps had to be imported from abroad. So even though the Chinese language was used, the modifier <em>yang</em> 'foreign or imported' had to be added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>nails</em> <em>yang ding</em></p>\n<p><em>matches</em> <em>yang huo</em></p>\n<p><em>oil</em> <em>yang yiou</em></p>\n<p><em>soap</em> <em>yang yizi</em></p>\n<p><em>cement</em> <em>yang hui</em>; (literally, 'foreign ash')</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the development of industry, <em>yang</em> was deleted. Now the young generation of Chinese do not understand <em>yang yizi;</em> they know <em>fei zao</em> for <em>soap</em>, or <em>xiang zao</em> for <em>toilet soap</em>. The age when foreign oils, Mobil and Shell, were dominant in the Chinese market has gone. Nevertheless, in some Chinese novels and films and in some spoken Chinese, we can hear <em>yang guizi</em>, 'foreign devil,' a derogatory term referring to a foreigner, especially from western countries, like Professor Charlie Blinderman, who was kind enough to type this article.</p>\n<p>In the mainland of China, in Taiwan, and in Hong Kong there may be different translations of the same English word. The English word <em>computer</em> was translated into <em>ji suan ji</em> 'calculating machine,' in the mainland of China, but into <em>dian nao</em>, 'electronic brain' in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In spite of political barriers, the academic circle in the mainland of China prefer <em>dian nao</em> to their original translation of 'calculating machine': calculating being just one of the several functions of computers, Taiwan's translation is felt to be more exact. There have been a lot of different translations of computer terms which are waiting for unification by the Chinese scholars on both sides of the Taiwan channel.</p>\n<p><em>Kennedy</em> on the mainland is <em>ken ni di;</em> but in Taiwan it is <em>gan nai di. Bush</em> on the mainland is <em>bu shi;</em> but in Taiwan it is <em>bu xi</em>. New Zealand is <em>niu xi lan</em> in Taiwan; but it is <em>xin xi lan</em> on the mainland.</p>\n<p>It is certain there will be more and more English words coming into the Chinese vocabulary, and vice-versa. Chinese has made many contributions to English, among them <em>typhoon, sampan, taipan, tea, silk, tong, Shanghai</em> as a verb, and <em>tofu</em>. The Chinese words <em>kung fu</em> and <em>wok</em> are currently in vogue in the US, whence they are likely to spread to other English-speaking countries.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
