This word is\na disjunctive personal pronoun and is as much a nominative\nas “je,” merely being more stressed.  If, though, Mr. Robinson\nwould have liked to say that “It's me” is philologically\nspeaking perfectly correct, as the “me” is probably a disjunctive,\nthis view is quite acceptable.  —<em>David Wendon, Lowestoft</em>.</p>\n<p>□  Lt.-Col. Robinson was indeed taught English badly.\nThe fault lies not with Latin grammar but with its abuse\nby inept pedagogues.</p>\n<p>Logic, not Latin, makes the verb “to be” intransitive.\nNevertheless, “it's me” is perfectly acceptable colloquial\nusage; it's comfortable (as Fowler said in a different context)\nand your correspondent should feel free to use it, and\nnot to blame onto Latin the results of sloppy teaching or\nthinking.  —<em>(Mrs.) Marion Friedmann, London NW3</em>.</p>\n<p>□  Lt.-Col. Robinson's distaste for constructions such as\n“This was given to my wife and I as a wedding present”\nwill be shared by many especially when the solecism is\nfoisted in stage and TV performances upon authors who\ndid not use it (as in the TV production of Jane Austen's\nEmma, in which Emma is made to say “between Miss Fairfax\nand I,” where the text, chapter 24 has me).\nBut it would be interesting to learn from some authority\non historical English usage whether the thing was once a\npermissible colloquialism (like “was you?”  now very vulgar).\nIn Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer, Mrs. Hardcastle\nsays to Tony Lumpkin: “Give your father and I some\nof your company”; and a character in Ben Jonson's Bartholomew\nFayre says (V. iv 253): “Between you and I, sir, we\ndo but make show.”  Did this sort of thing go underground\nand reappear in modern times?  —_J. F. Killeen, Galway.</p>\n<p>□  Baffled by the usage of “I” and “me,” Colonel Robinson's\nfriend should fall back on the safety and modesty of\n“myself.” —<em>D. M. Greenhalgh, Southampton</em>.</p>",
