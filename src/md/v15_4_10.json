To the\nhorror of some Western readers, however, he was at\nleast once quoted out of context as having threatened\nto “bury” America.  And he did say that.  But the Russian\nverb he used in a sentence that was more a bellicose\nboast than a threat was <em>pokhoronit'</em>, which means\n'bury,' all right, but in the sense of the verb in “we\nburried Grandma last week.”  When Nikita Sergeevich\nbragged that the USSR would bury the USA, he meant\nthat technologically and economically the Soviets\nwould leave us in the dust, would be around for our\nfuneral, not that they would put us six feet under.</p>\n<p>If our press would attain true excellence in selecting\nEnglish expressions to correspond to Russian originals,\nit should exercise more care about designating\nthe <em>Soviet Union</em> as “Russia” and <em>Soviets</em> as “Russians.”\nRussia, now the RSFSR (for Russian Soviet Federated\nSocialist Republic) is only one of several Soviet republics,\nwhich are more like states of the United States\nthan what we generally mean by “republic,” and Russians\n(sometimes redundantly called “ethnic Russians”)\nmake up only about half of the population of the\nUSSR.  So referring to the USSR as “Russia” is a mistake\non the order of calling the United Kingdom or\nGreat Britain “England.”  However, the boundaries of\nthe tsar's empire, for centuries known as “Russia,” were\napproximately the same as those of the Soviet Union; it\nwas occasionally known as “the Russias,” as in the formula\n“Tsar of all the Russias”; thus, this particular\nconfusion comes naturally.  Gorbachev himself is said\nto have had to apologize while making a speech in the\nUkraine when he referred to the Ukraine as “Russian.”\nThis faux pas might be likened to the Queen of England's\nsaying in an address before Welsh miners, “As we\nhere in England well know ...”</p>\n<p>The problem of drawing a distinction between\nRussians and citizens of the USSR has been solved by\nborrowing the word <em>Soviet</em> into English as an adjective\nor a noun meaning a person and not an institution,\nexcept rarely as in the designation <em>Supreme Soviet</em>.  In\nRussian <em>Sovét</em> means basically 'counsel' and 'council'\nand by extension 'assembly'.  It never means a 'citizen of\nthe USSR' or any other kind of person in Russian,\nthough its adjectival derivative <em>sovetskii</em> can be used\nsubstantively alone or followed by <em>chelovek</em> 'person,' to\nmean a 'Soviet person.'  So the English word <em>Soviet</em>\ncorresponds to both the Russian noun <em>sovét</em> or much\nmore often to the Russian adjective <em>sovetskii</em> in their\nmany inflected forms.</p>\n<p>Currently two Russian words are challenging\ncorrespondents, among others, to find English\nequivalents: <em>perestroika</em> and <em>glasnost</em>'.  The first of\nthese Gorbachevian buzzwords can be handily calqued\ninto English as 'restructuring.'  <em>Glasnost</em>', though, is\nmore difficult.  As a calque it would come into English\nas <em>vocalness</em>, which is no word.  It is not a new word in\nRussian.  The 1935 edition of the four-volume <em>Tolkovyi\nSlovar' Russkogo Yazyka</em> ('Explanatory Dictionary of\nthe Russian Language') defines <em>glasnost'</em> as: “Accessibility\nto public discussion and evaluation; publicity.”  I\ncan think of no single English word that quite corresponds\nto this definition.  <em>Publicity</em> perhaps comes closest.\nBut since both <em>perestroika</em> and <em>glasnost'</em> from our\npoint of view do not mean 'restructuring' and 'publicity'\ngenerally, as the English words do to us, but rather\nrefer to reforms specifically initiated by Gorbachev,\nthe Russian words, particularly <em>glasnost'</em>, are usually\nborrowed into English unaltered (except in pronunciation).\nThere are, of course, precedents for this sort of\nintact borrowing: <em>pogrom, ukase, intelligentsia</em>, and\n<em>muzhik</em> for example.  And in the same way Russian\nspeakers have helped themselves to our <em>sex, jazz,\nlynch</em>, and <em>business</em>.</p>\n<p>Apropos of Gorbachev—and Khrushchev too for\nthat matter—those <em>es</em> in their names pose a problem of\nphonetic correspondence.  Though usually written in\nRussian like any other <em>e</em>, just as in English, they are\npronounced like <em>os</em>.  Sometimes in textbooks for children\nand beginners such <em>es</em> are marked in Russian with\ntwo dots over them; they are sometimes transliterated\ninto English as <em>os</em>, so that occasionally you will see the\nspelling <em>Gorbachov</em>, which in my opinion is preferable.\nThen another variant in transliteration is\n<em>-ov/-off, -ev/-eff</em>.  The name ending in double <em>f</em> for\nwhat in Russian is invariably <em>v</em> is seldom seen nowadays;\nbut a few decades ago or in documents or books\nwritten then you might have seen the two Soviet leaders'\nnames transliterated <em>Gorbacheff</em> or <em>Gorbachoff</em></p>",
