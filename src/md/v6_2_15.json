Most frequently\nhe has looked to the heavens and the movement of the\nheavenly bodies, thus giving rise to the “science” of astrology\n(as well as to its lesser known sister “science,” genethlialogy).\nDespite its preeminence and antiquity, however, astrology\nhas never had a monopoly on man's mantic efforts.  Other\npaths of inquiry have led to the practice of, for example, <em>cleromancy,\nsciomancy, crystallomancy, alphitomancy</em>, and\n<em>spodomancy</em>, to name only a few.</p>\n<p>Investigation reveals, in fact, that at one time or another,\nman has indulged in a great variety of different types of divination\nthat involved an equal number of objects, or methods,\nor both.  The objects and methods used seem most impractical\nto the modern pragmatic and scientific-oriented mind as a\nmeans of forecasting the future.  Yet, each has been used as a\nbasis for a pythonic system practiced sufficiently in time or\ngeographic area that some anthropologist, historian, or lexicographer\nhas felt obliged to confer on it a distinctive name\nor, perhaps more accurately, to record the distinctive term\nused for such system.</p>\n<p>The names of divination systems comprise in English a\nrelatively large and distinctive group of words ending in\n-<em>mancy</em>, a combining form meaning 'divination.'  But since\nnothing in the English language is ever without exceptions,\ntwo cautionary observations are in order.  First, not all words\nending in -<em>mancy</em> are names of divination systems; <em>aldermancy</em>\nand <em>psychomancy</em> are good examples.  Secondly, there are\na number of divination systems whose names end in something\nother than -<em>mancy</em>.  <em>Astrology</em> and <em>genethlialogy</em> have\nalready been mentioned.  Others include, for example, <em>chirognomy,\nchiroscopy, haruspicy</em> (or <em>haruspication</em>), <em>hieroscopy,\nhoroscopy, keraunoscopy, omoplatoscopy, orniscopy</em>\nand <em>palmistry</em>.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of mantic terminology that perhaps merits\nmentioning is that it includes a considerable number of synonyms.\nFor example, <em>chiromancy, chirognomy, chirosophy</em>,\nand <em>palmistry</em> are all words to describe the same mantic\nsystem.  Other sets of synonyms include, in addition to the\naforementioned <em>haruspicy</em> and <em>haruspication: caloptromancy</em>\nand <em>enoptromancy; spodomancy</em> and <em>tephramancy</em> (or <em>tephromancy);\nalectryomancy</em> and <em>alectoromancy; astromancy</em> and\n<em>sideromancy; crystallomancy</em> and <em>gastromancy; hieromancy</em>\nand <em>hieroscopy; necromancy</em> and <em>sciomancy; ornithomancy</em>\nand <em>orniscopy</em>; and <em>scapulimancy</em> and <em>omoplatoscopy</em>.  The\nother side of the coin is represented by <em>gastromancy</em>, which is\nnot only a synonym for <em>crystallomancy</em> but also the term for\ndivination by ventriloquism.</p>\n<p>Since readers of VERBATIM can reasonably be assumed to\nhave more than ordinary interest in words, they are invited to\ntest their knowledge of mantic terminology by matching up\nthe following list of names of 20 mantic systems with the companion\nlist of the objects/methods used therefor.
