I have long\ncherished the belief that the relationship between the testes\nand the Latin root of such words as <em>testify, testimony,</em> etc.,\nderived, not from the fact that they “bear 'witness' to manhood\nand virility”—an etymology alluded to by the <em>OED,</em>\nthough without much conviction—but rather from the Ancient\nRoman's practice of swearing by (among other things)\nwhat he held most precious and would least like to lose;\ni.e., by placing his hands on his genitals. (Perhaps akin to\nthe curious Old Testament oath elicited by Abraham from\nhis servant, “Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh”\n[Genesis, 24, 2]—a reciprocal action according to Josephus\n[<em>Antiquities</em>, I, 16]—and to Jacob's identical deathbed request\nof Joseph [Genesis, 47, 29].) At least so my venerable\nLatin teacher Mr. Sullivan once (blushingly) affirmed.

Without niggling unduly over a\ncouple of incorrect French genders—<em>histoire verte, langue\nverte,</em> please, not <em>vert</em>—I would point out that when a\nFrenchman cracks a wry smile it is his <em>rire</em> that is <em>jaune,</em>\nyellow, not his <em>ris</em> (which, as a noun, is archaic), and would\ntake even more strenuous issue with the alleged expression\n<em>reste bleu</em>. No Frenchman, to my knowledge, has ever been\nin one, whatever it is supposed to be. (It certainly isn't a\n'blue rest.') When befuddled or amazed he might well exclaim\nj'en <em>reste bleu,</em> literally 'I remain blue from it,” which\nis probably what Mr. Eisiminger had in mind, mistaking <em>en</em>\nfor the preposition in and the verb <em>reste</em> for a noun.</p>\n<p>In the adjoining neighborhood of the spectrum, it is of\ncultural interest to note the origin of another French expression\nhe mentions, <em>prendre sans vert,</em> 'to catch without\ngreen,' i.e., 'to take unawares.'
