I am glad that he could easily identify\nfifteen of my fellow linguists who share our concern.  Not being\na professional linguist himself (I could not find his name\nin the membership directory of the Linguistic Society of\nAmerica nor in the Directory of American Scholars), Mr.\nBrown may not be familiar with the history of linguistics.</p>\n<p>During the forties and the early fifties, the importance of\ngestures, which had been pointed out by Trager and Pike,\nwas an accepted fact.  Then there came a period when language\nwas analyzed “scientifically,” and this term was not\nunderstood to mean systematic, exact, exhaustive, non-contradictory,\nand non-falsifiable but referred mainly to the methodological\nrigor inherent in one particular analytical procedure.\nThat particular methodology called generative-transformational\ndid not include paralanguage, kinesics, or\ncultural influences.  In 1971, the theory of language acquisition\n(which I had proposed in a book published in 1964 — and\nwhich was based on an interactionalist model and traced language\ndevelopment to the cry of the infant and to his pointing\ngestures) was termed a non-theory because it was not in\nagreement with the then prevailing theory of language acquisition.\nLanguage was supposed to begin with grammar, and\nprelanguage was in no way relevant to the development of\nspeech.  In 1972, at a meeting on the methodology for dialect\nresearch, I presented a paper on the relation of verbal and\nnon-verbal behavior in inter-ethnic code switching, only to\nbe told by Raven McDavid, who is one of the most outstanding\ndialectologists in this country, that research in non-verbal\nbehavior warranted as little serious attention as do the irrelevant\nsociolinguistic observations of William Labov.  (At least\nI was in good company.)  In 1973, Gordon Hewes, in an excellent\narticle in <em>Current Anthropology</em>, felt it necessary to\nremark on “the long obsession of linguists with speech as the\nonly 'true form' of language.”</p>\n<p>Even as recently as last year, when I suggested a special\nsession on kinesics to the organizing committee of the International\nCongress of Linguists, I was informed that this subject\nmatter was “marginal” and that papers on non-verbal behavior\nwould be scheduled in the section on Semiotics, as if\nthe spoken language were not as much a semiotic system as\nthe non-verbal forms of communication and as if the latter\nwere not more closely linked to verbal language than animal\ncommunication.  As it turned out, the section on Semiotics at\nthat congress had some very interesting papers on non-verbal\nbehavior.</p>\n<p>I do not wish to imply that linguists do not recognize\nkinesics as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry.  Most\nlinguists nowadays would include it alongside verbal language\nwithin the study of communication.  Where, in my opinion,\nlinguists by and large are still behind psychologists and\nanthropologists is in their attempt to study language acquisition\nand speech programming as a self-contained process\nwithout reference to the accompanying body motions and the\nsocial factors which influence communicative behavior.  The\nclimate is changing, and more and more psycholinguists are\nnow working from a broader base.  Recent textbooks in introductory\nlinguistics are starting to include full chapters on\nkinesics.</p>\n<p>If my article implies that spoken language is not a superb\nhuman accomplishment, I must not have expressed myself\nclearly.  My point is that the oral-aural mode is intricately\ncombined with the tactile-visual mode.  Some very important\nresearch by Peyton Todd has documented this in his case\nstudy on the structural interference across sensory modalities\nin second language learning.  We cannot disregard the fact\nthat human communication is multi-channel, as Birdwhistell\nput it many years ago.</p>\n<p><em>[Walburga von Raffler-Engel, Vanderbilt University]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
