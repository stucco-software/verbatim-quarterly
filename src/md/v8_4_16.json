My inquiries failed to account for the usage;\nnowhere else have I encountered the expression.</p>\n<p>The <em>OED</em> may offer a clue identifying <em>reins</em> as once a\ncommon term for 'kidneys or loins.'  Presumably these definitions\nsurvived in the isolation of the Islands after their\nintroduction by Scots or English overseers to slaves working the\nplantations.  An interesting example of similar usage appears in\n<em>A Counter-Blaste to Tobacco</em>, by James I, published anonymously\nin 1604: “But by the contrary, if a man smoke himselfe\nto death with it (and many have done) O then some other\ndisease must beare the blame for that fault.  So do olde harlots\nthanke their harlotrie for their many yeares, that custome being\nhealthfull (say they) <em>ad purgandos Renes</em>, but never have\nminde how many die of the Pockes in the flower of their\nyouth.”  But nowhere have I heard the Elizabethan term for the\nvenereal sore in the groin, <em>Winchester goose</em>, and only in\nCharleston have I heard the term <em>haircut</em> used for the chancre\nof syphilis.  The origin of this use should be apparent.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
