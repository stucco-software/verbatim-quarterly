<p><em><span data-rel="author">D.G. Kehl</span> <span data-rel="location">Arizona State University</span></em></p>
<p>One of the anecdotes to come out of Bernard Malamud's
twelve years of teaching at Oregon State recounts how
the yet-unpublished novelist concluded his first class by leaning
over the lectern and saying, “It has been brought to my
attention that many of you people here today are practicing
celibacy.  I have nothing against this practice and will not
penalize you for it.”  When a few nervous giggles issued from
the back of the room, Malamud pointed his finger at the
gigglers and said, “I have documents in my possession which
show that each one of you back there matriculated within the
last two weeks.  One as recently as this morning.”  It is rumored
that when the session ended with the sound of more nervous
laughter, most of the class stole forth to consult dictionaries or
roommates.</p>
<p>When the same linguistic ploy was used a year later,
allegedly by Claude Pepper's opponent in the 1950 senatorial
election in Florida, the provincial rural listeners either had no
dictionaries and roommates or felt no need to consult either.
The remarks, which had a considerably more devastating
effect, were as follows: “Are you aware that Claude Pepper is
known all over Washington as a shameless extrovert?  Not only
that, but this man is reliably reported to practice nepotism with
his sister-in-law, and he has a sister who was once a thespian in
wicked New York.  Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr.
Pepper before his marriage habitually practiced celibacy.”[^a1]
Pepper was soundly defeated by 67,000 votes.</p>
<p>These two anecdotes illustrate what might be called quasi
malediction fancy but unfamiliar, sinister- or risque-sounding
words somewhere between paronomasia and malapropism.  Like
the pun and double-entendre, quasi malediction is based on
similarity of sound between two words with vastly different
meanings, but, unlike the pun, it is less a play on words than a
confusion between words: linguistic <em>malentendu</em>.  Like the
malapropism, quasi malediction involves similarity in sound
between words, but, unlike the malapropism, it is not used
incorrectly, nor does it express an untruth.  Rather, the confusion
results from a kind of linguistic short-circuiting through
phonetic association.</p>
<p>If it seems hard to believe that the example Malamud used
in 1949 would work effectively on today's more sophisticated
freshmen, here is a suggested update: “It has come to my
attention that many of you are openly practicing altruism.
Furthermore, I know for a fact that there are numerous
thespians on campus and a great deal of unabashed homogeneity.
As if that weren't incredible enough, there are openly
acknowledged philatelists, Saturnians, and practitioners of Satyagraha
! To those of you tittering in the back, let me say that I
have seen students on this campus openly defenestrating and
can assert unequivocally that you people have been masticating
up to three and four times a day and even doing it openly in
groups.”</p>
<p>It would not be hard to imagine Senator Sludgebottom,
reactionary member of the state legislature's Appropriations
Committee, speaking in opposition to the proposed budget for
State U.  “I wonder if you, my esteemed colleagues, and the
morally upright taxpayers of this state, realize what is going on
at State U., supported by our tax dollars!  On a recent visit to
the campus, I saw students openly festinating on the malls,
conjugating in the halls, and even lucubrating in library stalls
till all hours of the night!  Altruistic professors are teaching
things like syntactics, synonymy, syncretism, and synergism.
And, incredible as it may seem, professors make a habit of
examining students' theses!  Furthermore, I have documented
proof that several have openly advocated polysyndeton!  One of
the custodians told me that he has found used phylacteries
around the campus.  English professors actually teach their
students to conjugate, even providing demonstrations, and talk
about copulative verbs and genitive case, about rising action,
climax, and falling action!  Because of such a paradisaic atmosphere,
which spawns lustration and plenipotent activity among
students, tax monies are now being expended on such things as
CLEP examinations and herpetology!  If we don't put our foot
down now, next thing we know the administration will be dispensing
phylacteries in the Student Union!”</p>
<p>Unlike the punster, who relies on his audience's awareness
of the two words' denotations, the user of quasi malediction
relies on his audience's ignorance of the denotation and
confusion over connotation through phonetic association.
Unlike Mrs. Malaprop and her kin, who confuse the denotation
of two words and substitute one for the other on the basis of
connotative confusion, the user of quasi malediction, fully
aware of both, chooses an erudite but pejorative-sounding
word, intending the false connotation to short-circuit the
correct denotation.</p>
<p>One of the few belletrists to make use of quasi malediction
in fiction is Peter De Vries.  Perhaps his favorite example, at
least the most often recurring (appearing in four of his twenty
novels) is this one: “I have just found out my husband is
heterosexual.”[^a2]
Another version occurs in <em>Madder Music</em>, when
a character announces at a fashion-show luncheon hosted by
his wife, “Hi.  I'm a closet heterosexual.”[^a3]</p>
<p>In De Vries's <em>Through the Fields of Clover</em> there is this
interchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He's a famous philatelist.”</p>
<p>“I suppose the theater is full of those....  Well in that
case I suppose a girl is safe from him at least....  Has
he ever undergone treatment for it?”</p>
<p>“It's hopeless.  He's up all night with the things.  Some
rare specimens in his collection.”</p>
<p>“I can imagine.  Can you tell me something about his
background?  Where is he from?”</p>
<p>“Walla Walla.  His father was the town podiatrist.”</p>
<p>“Then it runs in the family.  My, this sort of thing is
on the increase....”[^a4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Cotton, the confused character, finally gets it all
straight or thinks she does someone tells her that So-and-so is
a well-known pederast, and she says, “Tell me, does he have a
large practice?”   an example of true malediction unrecognized.
Later in the same novel, another character says to Cotton,
“You're still interested in monads.”  Cotton's mother, Mrs.
Marvel, replies, “Well, intellectual often goes with high-sexed.”[^a5]</p>
<p>Another example occurring in two of De Vries's novels
uses <em>charisma</em> as quasi malediction: “They tell me you have
charisma.  You certainly don't look well.  Are you taking anything
for it?”[^a6]</p>
<p>Another example occurring in two of De Vries's novels
uses <em>charishma</em> as quasi malediction: “They tell me you have
charishma.  Tou certainly don't look well.  Are you taking anything
for it?”[^a7] Then there is the woman who fed her husband
oysters “because she'd heard they were good for virility 
thinking that was something to be cured”[^a8]
the woman who thinks <em>afro</em> is short for <em>afrodisiac</em>, having something to do “with
colored people being so highly sexed”;[^a9] the character who thinks “exhibitors” are “preverts”;[^a10]
the character who thinks a penal colony is a place where male chauvinists should be
incarcerated[^a11] and the character who says, “I seemed to have an animus I didn't know what that meant, but it sounded
dirty.”[^a12]</p>
<p>Quasi malediction is innocent language which <em>sounds
dirty</em>.  Sometimes the connotative short-circuiting is completely
unintentional on the part of the speaker or writer.  Any English
teacher who has attempted to teach Emily Dickinson's poem
“There Is No Frigate Like a Book” to a class of undergraduates
has been introduced to the effect of unintentional quasi
malediction in the classroom!  The same nervous giggles can be
heard when one uses such innocuous words as <em>fructifying,
frigorific, feckless, scrutable</em>, and <em>copulative verb</em>.</p>
<p>Examples of quasi malediction with anatomical associations
are: <em>Regina/reginal, Künstlerroman, cochlea, cochinal,
cockchafer, cockshy, cocksure, penal</em> and <em>penology, titillate,
titivate, tit for tat, asinine</em>, and <em>assonance</em>.  Associations with
bodily functions and scatology (a word sometimes confused
with <em>eschatology</em>, thus rendering the latter, in those cases, quasi
malediction) have produced such examples as: <em>crapulence/
crapulous, shittah, piscine, pisiform, piscatology, epistemology,
fasces, infarct/infarction</em>, and <em>mensuration</em>.  Sensitive speakers
will be wary of talking about <em>seminal influences, Pithecanthropus
Erectus, cunning lingua franca</em>, and in the case of
Catholic theology, <em>ejaculatory prayers</em>.</p>
<p>When words are used with full reliance on the audience's
knowledge of denotations and awareness of, with no confusion
over, the connotations, the result is a form of paronomasia.  For
example, the movie “E.T.” used a pun on <em>Uranus</em>.  Similarly,
such titles as Jerzy Kosinski's <em>Cockpit</em> and Mickey Spillane's
<em>Erector Set</em> are double entendres, whereas Robert Coover's
<em>Pricksongs and Descants</em> could validly be called an example of
quasi malediction if for no other reason than the fact that
relatively few would be acquainted with those forms of
medieval music.</p>
<p>Humorless readers of C.S. Lewis might summarily dismiss
as unintentional quasi malediction what is more likely an
effective double entendre.  In his Preface to <em>The Screwtape
Letters</em>, Lewis, discussing the depiction of angels in visual art,
refers to “the frigid houris of a teatable paradise.”  Both
adjectives can be read as effective puns: the beautiful, black-eyed,
seductive, Persian nymphs are not only stiff and formal
but also sexually cold, just as the “paradise” is characterized
not only by an atmosphere of people sitting at tea but also by a
profusion of ample, abundant, and available teats!  Such a reading
hardly conflicts with the attitudes of a writer who argued
eloquently in <em>The Four Loves</em> for humor in the bedroom!</p>
<p>More than most linguistic modes, such as paronomasia and
malapropism, quasi malediction has diametric force.  On one
hand it can be used perniciously for propagandistic manipulation
and even character assassination the linguistic form of
guilt by association but on the other hand it can be used
beneficially in the cause of Thalia to create effective humor.
Perhaps more widespread knowledge of the mode will decrease
manipulation and increase and enhance the humor.</p>
