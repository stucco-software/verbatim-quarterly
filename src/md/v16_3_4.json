Those who kiss the Blarney stone are reputed\nto be able to charm the pants off everyone\never after.  <em>Bunk</em> is a shortening of <em>bunkum,</em> itself a\nrespelling for Buncomber County, North Carolina,\nwhose congressional representative once remarked\nthat he was “only talking for Buncombe.”</p>\n<p><em>Claptrap</em> turns out to be a show biz metaphor\nfor high-sounding but empty language.  The word\nwas originally a theatrical term for a showy trick or\npatch of high-flown, grandiose language that actors\nwould use to attract ('trap') applause ('claps') from\ntheir audiences.  Another rhyming reduplication,\n<em>mumbo jumbo,</em> is probably borrowed from a word in\nAfrican Mandingo: <em>Mama Dyumbo</em> was a deity who\nhelped husbands to bewilder wives whom they suspected\nof talking too much.</p>\n<p>The poet William Cowper once wrote “philologists\nwho trace/A panting syllable through time and\nspace,/Start it at home, and hunt it in the dark/To\nGaul, to Greece, and into Noah's ark.”  Almost always,\nan etymological safari into any subject bags at\nleast a few animals.  <em>A cock and bull story,</em> for example,\nderives from ancient fables and medieval bestiaries\nin which cocks moralized, bulls expostulated,\nand a menagerie of other animals discoursed in human\nlanguage.  <em>Cockamamie</em> has nothing whatever to\ndo with roosters, talking or otherwise.  In 19th-century\nFrance, fashionable ladies applied increasingly\nelaborate beauty spots to their upper cheeks.  This\ncraze became known as <em>décalcomanie,</em> from <em>décalc-</em>\n(from <em>décalquer</em> 'transfer a tracing' + -<em>o</em>- + <em>manie</em>\n'mania,' whence we get <em>decalcomania</em> (<em>decal</em> for\nshort for the transfers), and the adjective <em>cockamamie</em>\nsome say echoes the sense of florid but superficial\nembellishment.  <em>Hogwash,</em> of course, is a designation\nfor language as 'worthless, disgusting, and unfit\nfor human consumption, as pig slops.'</p>\n<p>Puffy, bureaucratic verbiage if often called <em>gobbledygook,</em>\na word credited to Texas congressman\nMaury Maverick, who compared the tortuous (and\ntorturous) prose of Washington bureaucrats to the\nsenseless gobbling of turkeys.  Maverick made the\nword famous with a World War II memorandum denouncing\nthe bloated language found in government\nreports: “Be short and say what you're talking\nabout.  Stop 'pointing up' programs.  No more 'finalizing,'\n'effectuating,' or 'dynamics.'  Anyone caught\nusing the words 'activation' or 'implementation' will\nbe shot.”  Closely related to <em>gobbledygook,</em> but more\nmalicious, is <em>doublespeak</em>.  In 1973, the National\nCouncil of Teachers of English established a Committee\non Public Doublespeak to help identify and\nstamp out evasive and obfuscating terminology slithering\nout of public sources, such as “uncontrolled\ncontact with the ground” for “airplane crash” and\n“inoperative statement” for “lie.”  <em>Doublespeak</em> is a\nblending of <em>Double-talk</em> and <em>Newspeak,</em> the insidious\nlanguage of George Orwell's <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>.</p>\n<p>A number of loopily echoic words resonate with\nthe nonsense of non-sense.  <em>Folderol</em> (or <em>falderal</em>) is\ndrawn from the meaningless syllables sung in the refrains\nof many English folksongs, “fol-de-rol-deray.”\n<em>Tommyrot</em> compounds <em>tommy,</em> 'simpleton, fool'\n(as in <em>tomfoolery</em>) and <em>rot,</em> 'worthless matter.'  In his\n<em>Second Browser's Dictionary,</em> John Ciardi suggests\nthat “<em>tommy</em> is a variant of <em>tummy,</em> the sense shift\nhaving been from 'stomach garbage' to 'brain garbage.'\n”  And <em>poppycock</em> comes from the Danish <em>pappekak,</em>\nliterally 'soft poop' or 'baby poop,' an appropriately\nscatological etymology for logorrhea.</p>\n<p>That we have been able to come up with so\nmany words to describe forked-tongued and muddle-headed\nlanguage indicates that we may one day\nnot just speak but communicate.  That we have been\nso intelligent about identifying unintelligible persiflage\ngives hope that we may learn not just to talk\nbut to say something.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
