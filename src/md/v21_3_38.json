This is truly a quotable book of quotations, many from more modern writers than one might expect to find in other sources.</p>\n<p>It would be difficult to compile such a work without ready access to Mencken, Wilde, Shaw, and others of their sort. This book (the possession of which may become a substitute for reading it, to paraphrase Anthony Burgess in <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>) should appeal to anyone over the age of thirty who has developed a sufficiently mature sense of reality to become a cynic.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
