<p>“We cut off their heads and then let the blood drain
out,” the Michigan State professor told his European
visitor cheerfully.  He was describing his laboratory's experiments
on frogs.  “But in our reports,” he continued, “you'll read
that we decapitate and subsequently exsanguinate them.  Oh,
why must scientific publications always be so studded with
learned expressions that even well-educated outsiders can
hardly make sense of them?”  He would have had less reason
for complaining if he could have drafted his reports in Dutch.
In Holland, even the most pedantic scientist would not think of
using Latinisms like <em>decapitate</em> or <em>exsanguinate</em>.  He would
rather write <em>de kop afsnijden</em> 'sever the head' and <em>laten
leegbloeden</em> 'let bleed until empty.'  And no reader, whatever
his education, has any difficulty in understanding such phrases.</p>
<p>This is by no means the only instance where scientific
terminology is more accessible to the general public in Dutch
than in English.  When a doctor in Holland diagnoses pneumonia,
he need not give his patient a lengthly explanation but
simply tells him that he is suffering from <em>longontsteking</em>.  The
word literally means 'lung inflammation' and thus conveys, in
everyday language, the essence of what a lay person normally
wants to know about his condition.  Numerous medical terms
are equally unesoteric in Dutch, such as <em>hersenschudding</em> 'brain
shaking,' i.e. concussion or <em>hersenvliesontsteking</em> 'brain-membrane
inflammation,' i.e. meningitis.  Even the science of
medicine itself is in most cases referred to in words whose
meaning a child can grasp, namely <em>geneeskunde</em> 'the knowledge
of curing' or <em>geneeskunst</em> 'the art of curing.'  This terminological
transparency is, as we shall see, not restricted to the sphere of
medicine.</p>
<p>Stressing the relatively high proportion of Latinate terms
in English may seem a sheer platitude.  We all know that
English, unlike Dutch, is not a “pure” Germanic language but
derives from Latin and Old French as well.  A higher frequency
of vocables of Romance root is therefore unsurprising.  All this
is true, but it is beside the point here.  The purpose of this
article rather is to highlight a practical consequence of this
situation: whereas a considerable proportion of English scientific
terminology is compounded from recondite elements (usually
of Latin or Greek origin) and hence abstruse to the
uninitiated, Dutch offers in many such cases an expression that
is made up from everyday words so that any layman can
understand it.</p>
<p>Let us look at another example.  When an English-speaking
child is confronted for the first time with the word <em>polygon</em>, he
needs an explanation.  Then, after having been taught what the
word stands for, he has to deal with another problem: how to
retain the meaning in his memory.  He will have to learn the
relationship between the new word and the signified object by
rote, because the components of the word are of no help in the
memorization process.  Indeed, they are literally Greek to him.
On the other hand, a Dutch child has no such difficulties.  The
corresponding word is <em>veelhoek</em> 'many-corner,' which is self-explanatory,
even with the limited vocabulary of a youngster.
And the meaning can be recalled at any moment since the
components constitute a built-in mnemonic aid.  In short, this
scientific term offers him no more problems than, say, the word
<em>keyhole</em> does to an English-speaking child.  This is so for many
other geometrical expressions as well: <em>schuine zijde</em> 'slanted
side,' i.e. hypotenuse; <em>kromme</em> 'a bent one,' i.e. curve; <em>raaklijn</em>
'touching line,' i.e. tangent; <em>middelloodlijn</em> 'middle lead line'
(<em>lead</em> = 'plumb'), i.e. perpendicular bisector; <em>zesvlak</em> 'six-plane,'
i.e. hexahedron.</p>
<p>Geometry itself is called <em>meetkunde</em> 'the knowledge of
measuring.'  Incidentally, the ending -<em>kunde</em>, which occurs in
the names of many branches of science, is obviously a cognate
of <em>ken</em> (in the sense of 'range of knowledge').  So alongside
<em>meetkunde</em> 'measuring ken,' we have <em>rekenkunde</em> 'calculating
ken,' i.e. arithmetic; <em>stelkunde</em> 'positing ken,' i.e. algebra; and
the other subdivisions of <em>wiskunde</em> 'certainly ken,' i.e.
mathematics.</p>
<p>Picturesque and sometimes amusing instances can be
culled from other parts of the curriculum as well: <em>stikstof</em>
'choking matter,' i.e. nitrogen, from <em>scheikunde</em> 'sundering
ken,' i.e. chemistry; <em>kernsplitsing</em> 'kernel splitting,' i.e. nuclear
fission, from <em>natuurkunde</em> 'nature ken,' i.e. physics;
<em>rangtelwoord</em> 'rank count-word,' i.e. ordinal numeral, from
<em>spraakkunst</em> 'language art,' i.e. grammar; <em>vleeseter</em> 'flesh eater,'
i.e. carnivore, from <em>plant-en dierkunde</em> 'plant and animal ken,'
i.e. biology; <em>Stille Oceaan</em> 'Calm Ocean,' i.e. the Pacific, from
<em>aardrijkskunde</em> 'earth-kingdom ken,' i.e. geography; <em>melkwegstelsel</em>
'Milky Way system,' i.e. galaxy, from <em>sterrekunde</em> 'stars
ken,' i.e. astronomy.</p>
<p>Some of these examples may give the impression that a
scientific discussion in Dutch sounds like sophisticated baby
talk, but that's because I have told only half the story so far.
The full truth is that most of the learned expressions used for
scientific notions in English (and other Western languages) are
also known in Holland.  They form part of the vocabularies of
many people and are to be found in dictionaries, albeit adapted
to Dutch spelling conventions.  So, for <em>philosophy</em>, we have the
choice between <em>filosofie</em> and <em>wijsbegeerte</em> 'desire for wisdom,'
just as in English one may either use <em>penultimate</em> or <em>last but
one</em>.  In fact, it's quite normal for Dutch scientific terminology
to occur in pairs composed of a “difficult” and a homier
variant: <em>ephemerid</em> can be translated as <em>efemeride</em> or as <em>eendagsvlieg</em>
'one-day fly'; also in the figurative sense; <em>hypothesis</em>
as <em>hypothese</em> or as <em>veronderstelling</em> 'under-setting,' and so on.</p>
<p>Similar pairs exist in English as well (although to a lesser
extent, I feel).  In both languages they may present a problem
to the user: sometimes the twins are absolutely interchangeable,
sometimes not entirely, sometimes not at all.  It seems
indeed true that there is a time and a place for everything!  The
system of usages that govern this interchangeability in Dutch is
much too intricate to be set out here in full.  Nevertheless, a
few remarks may be of interest to the English-speaking reader
because they can help him to discover analogous patterns in his
own language.</p>
<p>In the first place, when is a pair really a pair?  Words like
<em>uneatable</em> and <em>inedible</em> must have been synonymous at one
time, but now many people feel that they have slightly
different meanings (in certain contexts at least) and should not
be confounded.  Such pseudo-pairs are encountered in Dutch
too.  The nearest equivalent of <em>melancholic</em> is <em>melancholiek</em>, but
we also have the word <em>zwartgallig</em> 'with black bile.'  Although a
literal translation of its Greek twin, the latter represents a
slightly different nuance of gloominess.  Perhaps it's more like
'atrabilious'!</p>
<p>Secondly, even when two vocables appear to have identical
meanings to the layman, an expert may have his doubts.
Scientists favor unambiguous words that designate sharply
defined notions.  Anatomists would rather say <em>esophagus</em> (or
spell it <em>oesophagus</em>) than <em>gullet</em> because nobody knows exactly
where a gullet begins or ends, and, anyway, the word has more
than one meaning, even within the field of anatomy.  For
similar reasons, a Dutch geologist prefers <em>vulkaan</em> 'volcano' to
the pictorial but imprecise <em>vuurspuwende berg</em> 'fire-spitting
mountain.'  On the other hand, he would have no objection to
alternating <em>eruptie</em> 'eruption' with <em>uitbarsting</em> 'outburst,' the
latter giving no rise to confusion in a given context.  Dutch
scientists seem to be more often in a position to use such a
demotic term than their English-speaking colleagues.  To come
back to <em>gullet</em>, the Dutch equivalent is <em>slokdarm</em> 'swallowing
gut,' an earthy expression but quite precise and therefore not
unfit for a professional text.</p>
<p>But we had better not attempt a full-scale analysis here.
Even when all parties agree that the scholarly and the vernacular
members of a given pair of scientific terms have exactly the
same meaning, their interchangeability is nonetheless subject to
a maze of unwritten rules.  It may be a matter of context, of
spoken or written language, of tradition, “good manners,”
prudery, and so on (cf. <em>abdomen</em> versus <em>belly</em>).  Sometimes it is
a matter of class, and often one of generation.  There are also
euphonic considerations, individual quirks, linguistic chauvinisms,
snob habits (“arcane = chic”), and inverted snobberies
(“simple = honest”).  We shall not dwell on these variations,
but there is one aspect that should not go wholly unmentioned:
the fluctuations of usage in the course of time.</p>
<p>Preferences for learned and for familiar words change over
the years.  Nowadays, it has become somewhat outmoded to say
<em>staathuishoudkunde</em> 'state household ken' for <em>economics</em> or
<em>aardkunde</em> 'earth ken' for <em>geology.  Weerkunde</em> 'weather ken,'
i.e. meteorology, and <em>kruidtuin</em> 'plant garden,' i.e. botanical
garden, are definitely out (except in Belgium: linguistic developments
in Flanders do not always run parallel to those in
Holland, because they are partly determined by political
considerations).  Anatomical atlases have done away with the
somewhat bluff <em>pisbuis</em> 'piss tube,' i.e. urethra.  The <em>grote
lichaamsslagader</em> 'big beating vein of the body,' i.e. aorta, is
also about to go; it was marvelously descriptive, though quite a
mouthful!  On the other hand, new self-explanatory expressions
are constantly being coined for the goodies that this age keeps
bestowing upon us.  <em>Rekentuig</em> 'calculation gear' for <em>computer</em>
has not caught on, but <em>ongevalsheelkunde</em> 'accident healing
ken' for <em>traumatology</em> seems to have a future.  But enough of all
that.</p>
<p>A completely different question is the semantic content of
those easy-to-understand Dutch words.  As several of the preceding
examples suggest, many apparently native expressions
are really calques of Greco-Latinate terms that have international
currency in the world of science.  Here are a few more:
<em>dierenriem</em> 'animal belt,' i.e. zodiac; <em>mierenzuur</em> 'ants sour,' i.e.
formic acid; <em>knaagdier</em> 'gnawing animal,' i.e. rodent; <em>vierling</em>
'fourling,' i.e. quadruplets; <em>zelfmoord</em> 'self-murder,' i.e. suicide;
<em>Onbevlekte Ontvangenis</em> 'unstained begetting,' i.e. Immaculate
Conception.  Spells of Germanic chauvinism have left us with
unseemly agglutinations like <em>boldriehoeksmeting</em> 'ball three-corner
measuring,' i.e. spherical trigonometry, and uncritical
calquing made us adopt a few misnomers holus-bolus: <em>buik-spreker</em>
'belly speaker,' i.e. ventriloquist.</p>
<p>In other cases the translation is freer, or more explicit than
the original, or the two are not related at all: <em>aardolie</em> 'earth
oil,' i.e. petroleum; <em>schuilnaam</em> 'hiding name,' i.e. pseudonym;
<em>veelwijverij</em> 'many-womenship,' i.e. polygamy; <em>verloskunde</em>
'delivery ken,' i.e. obstetrics; <em>sterrebeeld</em> 'stars picture,' i.e.
constellation; <em>Maria Hemelvaart</em> 'Mary's passage to heaven,' i.e.
the Assumption; <em>vallende ziekte</em> 'falling disease,' i.e. epilepsy;
<em>kinderverlamming</em> 'children's paralysis,' i.e. poliomyelitis;
<em>heelal</em> 'whole all,' i.e. the universe.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with other Germanic languages may well
observe that all this is not descriptive of Dutch alone but
applies equally to German and the Scandinavian languages.
Indeed, many of the quoted instances are mere German loan
words, facile calques of calques.  Nevertheless, some of them
are Dutch originals, as are the following examples: <em>letterkunde</em>
'letters ken,' i.e. literature; <em>buikloop</em> 'belly run,' i.e. diarrhea;
<em>godgeleerdheid</em> 'God learning,' i.e. theology; <em>hoogleraar</em> 'high
teacher,' i.e. professor; <em>dierentuin</em> 'animals garden,' i.e. zoo;
<em>kraakbeen</em> 'creaking bone,' i.e. cartilage; <em>vermenigvuldigen</em> 'to
manifold,' i.e. to multiply.</p>
<p>Let us conclude with a few curiosities.  Some seemingly
simple words are tricky because they have come to express two
dissimilar notions, e.g. <em>zenuwarts</em> 'nerve doctor' for both <em>neurol</em>-
<em>ogist</em> and <em>psychiatrist</em>.  Others are sheer folk etymology, like
<em>scheurbuik</em> 'ripping belly' for <em>scurvy</em> (Lat. <em>scorbutus)</em>.  And a
few are as already pointed out outright misnomers, such as
<em>blindedarmontsteking</em> 'blind gut inflammation,' i.e. appendicitis,
and <em>eiwit</em> 'egg white,' i.e. protein.  But the “wrongness” of a
word has never been a reason to eliminate it from the
language.  Or is there anybody out there who is willing to give
up the word <em>atom</em>, just because the thing has subsequently
been found to be fissionable?  That would indeed beat the
Dutch!</p>
