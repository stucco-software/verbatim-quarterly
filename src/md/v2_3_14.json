It's a whole new thing. Take a word like <em>keks</em>—as in a breakfast menu announcing <em>hot keks</em>.  At dinnertime, the menu might—in fact, invariably will—feature <em>bistek</em> (or you can buy it at the butcher's; I myself have never been able to figure out the difference between <em>bistek</em> and <em>filete</em> at the butcher's, since they look suspiciously like the same cut and both, presumably, derive originally from the same beeflike animal—whence also derives the ubiquitous <em>hamburguesa</em>).  The more withit restaurants may offer <em>roles</em> (in place of the Mexican <em>bolillos</em>).  For dessert, you may order <em>pay</em>.  A word that baffled us for a long time was <em>donas</em>—those heavily sugared, fried cakes in the shape of a lifesaver that you can buy, as in the U.S., either fresh and hot at the baker's or, packaged in cellophane, at the grocer's.  While at the grocer's, you can also pick up a carton of <em>yus</em>.</p>\n<p>Along with food, the biggest arena for the new vocabulary, and one where it flourishes, is sports.  This isn't surprising, since these are probably the two most international activities (next to sex, which doesn't, after all, require an extensive vocabulary) in today's world.  In any language, golf is <em>golf</em>, and it's entirely logical that miniature golf, in Mexico, is <em>golfito</em>, but the sports pages of the big Mexico City dailies furnish a goldmine for the Spanglish seeker. They veritably bristle with accounts of <em>beisbol, futbol</em> (our soccer), even <em>volibol</em>.  <em>Tenis</em>, anyone?  In <em>futbol</em>, there are <em>gols</em>.  <em>Beisbol</em> is full of <em>rons</em> and <em>jits</em>, of course, and the <em>squeeze-pley</em> or even <em>los pley-offs</em> don't present insurmountable hurdles; but somehow nothing ever looks right, to a <em>norteamericano</em>, about a <em>jonrón</em>.  Even after you realize that a <em>ron</em> is a 'run,' there's something deep inside that resists recognizing that <em>jon</em> is 'home.'  That perverse Spanish pronunciation of the <em>j</em> (as in <em>jits</em>) brings you up short, every time.  (And where did that <em>n</em> for <em>m</em> come from, anyway?)</p>\n<p>As the discerning reader has already noticed, the secret of Spanglish lies in the fact that the word, originally English, is spelled so as to approximate its English pronunciation by a Spanish speaker.  If a native Spanish speaker were to come without warning or previous experience on the word \"cakes,\" for example, he would have no option but to give it two syllables (as in <em>roles</em>), the first with the <em>a</em> of <em>father</em>, the second with the <em>e</em> of <em>mess</em>—producing a sound that has no meaning in either English or Spanish. <em>Keks</em> solves the problem.</p>\n<p>Outside of the two major areas of food and sports, the Spanglish vocabulary tends to be spotty.  You can buy a <em>sueter</em> when the weather turns chilly, or some <em>champu</em> to wash your hair; if your inclinations are political, you can attend a <em>mitín</em> and listen to speeches by, or about, the <em>lider</em>.</p>\n<p>One of my own favorite adjectives, which doesn't really fulfill the criteria of the splanguage, is <em>folklorico</em>. This word, made respectable by the existence of the internationally famous Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, is creeping into more secular usages: \"Should I wear my pantssuit, or something more <em>folklorico</em>?\"</p>\n<p>In San Miguel de Allende, as renowned for its long-lived expatriate colony as for its spectacularly beautiful scenery and delightful climate, the resident Americans put out a directory among themselves, so that they will be able to find each other.  Its name, in impeccable Spanglish, is ?_Juardé?_</p>\n<p>Need a drink?  How about some <em>Escotch</em>?</p>\n<p><em>—Constant Rider, St. Louis, Mo.</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
