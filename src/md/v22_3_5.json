Not for them the teen British and American angst, rebellion and outrage expressed by such band names as <em>The Sex Pistols, The Nipple Erectors, The Slits</em> (all-girl, ho ho Hemingway), <em>The Dead Kennedys, The Butthole Surfers, Kid Kommode and the Bidet Boys, Pogue Mahone</em> (now knows as <em>The Pogues</em> since being dropped from the BBC's playlist because some scholar told the BBC that <em>pogue mahone</em> meant 'kiss my arse' in Irish), and so on. What is interesting about some of these purveyors of Japanese pap—I mean pop—is how their names appear on CD, cassette, and other labels and in the Japanese pop press.</p>\n<p>For this to be appreciated I must first briefly describe the complex Japanese system of writing. It consists of borrowed Chinese ideograms (characters known as <em>kanji</em>, the <em>hiragana</em> syllabary used for Japanese words not covered by <em>kanji</em>, the <em>katakana</em> syllabary used for foreign words, and the Roman alphabet known as <em>romanji</em> usually used for abbreviations like <em>UN</em> and acronyms like <em>GATT</em>. You can see the whole consort effortlessly dancing together on the front page of any Japanese newspaper. In the case of the names of their pop groups, this concatenation, however, assumes truly awesome and bizarre proportions, surely unknown, indeed not even possible, in any other language.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>• Meaningless names written in romanji: <em>B'z</em> (pronounced “bees”), <em>Lindberg, Qlair</em> (pronounced “kler”), <em>SAYE·S, SMAP, T-Bolan</em> (probably from the late British pop star Marc Bolan and his '70's group <em>T.Rex</em>), <em>trf</em> (pronounced “truf”), <em>Zard</em>.</p>\n<p>• English names written in romanji: a (always glossed in parentheses as 'alpha'), <em>Access, CoCo, Damn Rockers, Dreams Come True, Escalators Vanilla</em> (possibly inspired by the '60's American bands <em>Vanilla Fudge, The Mood Elevators, and Strawberry Alarm Clock</em>, though made ludicrous in conforming to Japanese grammar which requires the adjective to follow the noun), <em>Hound Dog, Jigger's Son</em> (four guys), <em>Judy and Mary</em> (three guys backing a girl singer), <em>Princess, Tube, Wink, Zoo</em>.</p>\n<p>• Japanese name written in romanji: <em>Mi-ke</em> (a winsome, snaggle-toothed teen warbler. <em>Mi-ke</em> is a popular name for pets, particularly cats).</p>\n<p>• English names written in katakana: <em>The Dark Ducks, J-League Downtown (J-League</em> is a soccer league), <em>Physical, Cruising, Omnibus, Original Love, The Peanuts</em> (twin sisters), <em>Southern All-Stars, The Tempters, Tokyo Performance Doll</em> (seven girls), <em>Tulip, Tunnels</em> (pronounced “toenails”), <em>Zutorobi</em> (“The Beatles” pronounced backwards, syllabically rather than alphabetically! The Seltaeb? Nah!).</p>\n<p>• Partly Japanese and partly Western name written in romanji: <em>Bakufu Slump</em> (literally, 'blast,' as in explosion, 'slump.' <em>Slump</em> is a loanword used in baseball and economics).</p>\n<p>• Partly Japanese and partly Western name written in kanji and romanji: <em>Comé Comé Club</em> (literally, 'rice rice club').</p>\n<p>• Pure Japanese name written in khanji and romanji: <em>Hikaru GENJI</em> (The kanji component, <em>hikaru</em>, means 'light (as illumination)'; <em>GENJI</em>, always capitalized, seems to be a literary allusion to Lady Shikumi Murasaki's <em>c</em>. A.D. 1000 novel <em>The Tale of Genji</em>, Genji being the male protagonist.)</p>\n<p>• Pure Japanese name written in kanji: <em>Otokogumi</em> ('Warriors' Group')</p>\n<p>• Pure Japanese name written in kanji and hiragana: <em>Kaguya-hime</em> (literally, 'Princess Sparkle,' from a classic Japanese nursery tale.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From all this we can clearly deduce that in no way can the Japanese be accused of xenophobia— linguistic, anyway! Indeed, L'Académie française might do well to note the above and the albeit absurd names of these two Japanese discos rendered in romanji: <em>Maharaja Saloon Sahara King &amp; Queen Disco Maebashi</em>, and <em>Maharaja Tokushima Space Disco Liberazione</em>.</p>",
