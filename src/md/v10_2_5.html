<p>In my family, food is treated as reverentially as conversation.
Since we all regard eating and talking as the noblest, if not
the only, worthwhile human endeavors, it is little wonder that
we have developed our own language about food.</p>
<p>There is no place in it for those clichéd staples of food
writers the “robust” stew, the “piquant” sauce, and the
“amusing” wine.  Instead, we speak of the “prance and a half,”
the “wad,” the “pick,” and the “nice little supper.”  To the
uninitiated, our consuming passion can be disconcerting.
Recently, my newly acquired brother-in-law declined to participate
in a communal “pick” with the astonishing intelligence
that he wasn't hungry.</p>
<p>“What has <em>that</em> got to do with it?”  my father demanded
severely.  The rest of us gaped at the alien in our midst.  Even
after a seven-course meal, we can always find room for what
Winnie the Pooh called “a little something.”</p>
<p>A “pick” is akin to “a little something” and usually
consists of an array of leftovers from a “prance.”  A “prance” is
a meal on which the hostess has labored for at least a week.
The term originated with my mother, who for twenty years
prepared elaborate holiday spreads two times annually, at
intervals only a month apart.  As the third decade dawned, she
served notice that she would no longer “prance with a turkey”
at <em>both</em> Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This gave rise to visions
of a giant turkey waltzing through the kitchen with Mama in
his arms.  The term stuck, as did a derivative, a “prance and a
half.”</p>
<p>The “prance and a half” applies when a hostess has
worked herself into a genuine lather over a meal.  If she has
spent hours poring over recipes to find the perfect blend of
dishes, if she has ferreted out obscure ingredients in dusty
ethnic markets, if she has strained these ingredients through
cheesecloth, if she has marinated them in olive oil, if she has
pulverized them with a mortar and pestle, then her Herculean
effort will be rewarded with the accolade “a prance and a
half.”</p>
<p>A “pick,” then, features a better class of food than mere
leftovers.  Rarely is the food reheated.  During a “pick,” dining
etiquette is suspended.  A table is not laid, nor is the Almighty's
blessing sought.  “Picks” are usually eaten standing up at the
refrigerator, without utensils.  One may coo appreciatively,
pigeon fashion.</p>
<p>In contrast to a “pick,” ordinary leftovers heated up and
passed off as a meal are called a “heppy-seffy.”  This rather
whimsical expression came our way from a visiting southern
belle.  She who offers up the “heppy-seffy” is made to feel
somewhat defensive.  Thus she deals the plates around the table
with narrowed eyes and calls out with an air of challenge,
“Hep yoresef.”  If the diners examine the food too critically 
before even sampling it she will snap that she's had a busy
day, and wasn't up to “horsing” with cooking.  “Horsing” is
short for “horsing around” and gives a pejorative nuance to the
usually laudable “prancing.”</p>
<p>A meal that is prepared with the proper respect for
ingredients but that entails far less work than a “prance” is
called “a nice little supper.”  “Nice little suppers” are served
only to guests one knows intimately, and only on weeknights.
Even “nice little suppers” always feature “beast,” or at least
“bird.”  Carnivores all, we take relish in using these designations
instead of the more euphemistic “beef” and “poultry.”
Chicken, even when it is young and tender, is often called “ol'
hen.”  This is a legacy of the family's roots on the farm.  There,
chickens were not sacrificed for food until, tough and elderly,
they had reached the nadir of their egg production.  One uses
convenience mixes and packages sparingly, even for a “nice
little supper.”</p>
<p>“Store boughten” food is disdained by my grandfather,
patriarch of the clan.  He is from the south and opines that
eating fruit-flavored gelatin is “raht next door to not eatin'.”
My mother is very much her father's daughter in that regard.
She once startled a timid visitor by declaring, quite without
provocation, “I cannot <em>stand</em> canned soup.  In fact, I don't even
like people who <em>like</em> canned soup.”</p>
<p>If you have made something “from scratch” but failed,
Aunt Ruthie will reproach, “You didn't love it enough.”
Likewise, Granny claims love and instinct are the ingredients
that assure perfect alchemy in food.  When begged for the
recipe for her incomparable noodles, she will be no more
specific with measurements than “a half-eggshell” of water and
a “smidgen” of salt.  Should you want to know how long to
beat, pound, knead or whip, she replies, with the hooded eyes
of Mona Lisa, “'Til it's raht.”</p>
<p>Like a “pick,” a “wad” is also eaten standing up.  A
“wad,” however, is a solitary piece of inferior, if not disgusting
food.  The diner falls upon it with little pleasure, merely to
quiet the beast in his belly.  Physically satisfied but psychologically
famished, he will probably succumb to a “binge” before
long.  “Binge,” in our tribe, has a narrow meaning.  To “binge”
is to devote oneself single-mindedly to a large quantity of a
given delicacy polishing off a pint jar of artichokes, a pound
can of Spanish peanuts, or a soup-bowl full of hot fudge sauce.
“Binges” are undertaken alone and in stealth, which gives them
a verboten quality that heightens the enjoyment.  An occasional
“binge” is tolerated nay, even expected.  Evidence of too
frequent “binging,” on the other hand, is considered faintly
perverse.  Eating and socializing are so interwoven that the
chronic lone “binger” gets the same reputation as one who
drinks alone before lunch.</p>
<p>As opposed to a “binge,” an “org,” short for “orgy,” is
undertaken by a group.  “Org” may also be used as a verb.  An
“org” is often inspired by batters, doughs, or other elixirs in the
middle stages of production.  Like sharks sniffing blood in their
waters, “orgers” gather intuitively from all corners of the
house.  Those who gather to lick the beaters from Aunt Ruthie's
brownies or who crouch over the ice-cream freezer to catch the
drippings off the paddle are said to be “orging.”  One who has
partaken so ambitiously of an “org” that he must lie belly up,
like a dead goldfish, is sympathetically diagnosed as “orged
out.”  Mama will urge him to “take” a little Coca-Cola to settle
his stomach.</p>
<p>At night, however, restless spirits who prowl the pantry
are “grazing.”  When a term fits, we borrow it.  I first read about
“grazing” in a magazine article lamenting the decline in public
morality.  “Grazing,” the outraged author explained, is what
supermarket managers call the behavior of certain mothers
with small children who frequent their stores.  As the mother
herds the children along, she stops long enough to open a box
of cereal or crackers, and sneak the kids a quick “wad.”  Then
she replaces the box on the shelf before moving on.</p>
<p>“Grazing,” to us, has a depraved connotation.  A “grazer”
is usually wild-eyed and clad in rumpled pajamas as he forages
from cabinet to cabinet, perhaps swiping his forefinger through
the peanut butter jar and then the honey jar before dipping it
into a bag of coconut or miniature marshmallows.  Likely as
not, a fellow insomniac plagued by nocturnal demons of his
own will hear the rustling and stumble down to join him.  If
there is nothing to titillate the palate in the house, the
“grazers” may adjourn to an open-all-night deli to “get us
something good to eat.”  Sometimes this phrase is abbreviated
to “get us something,” the quest for nourishment being
implied.  My father's approach is more pugnacious, when he
declares his intention to “get ahold of something good,” as if
he must first wrestle it to the ground.</p>
<p>Other verbs we find useful are “oinking,” “hunkering
down,” and “making bilge.”  “Oinking” is not to be confused
with stuffing down a “wad.”  One “oinks” such food as potato
chips or jelly beans, nutritionally worthless, but pleasing to
some individuals nonetheless.  An “oinker” is not necessarily
fat.  My sister is the quintessential “oinker” but keeps her
weight to a wraithlike 103 pounds.  This she accomplishes
through a regimen of strenuous exercise and a diet comprised
chiefly of Chablis and cheese-flavored tortilla chips.</p>
<p>To “hunker down” is to eat wholesome, plebeian food 
“vittles” in awesomely large portions.  But only children young
enough to require a high-chair “make bilge.”  “Bilge” is the
viscous substance that results when a tot mixes foods like peas,
mashed potatoes, ground meat, and pudding with his hands.
The high-chairs of “bilgers” can be cleaned only in the shower.</p>
<p>Infants not yet able to manage solid foods are described as
“blissing out” at the climax of a vigorous workout at breast or
bottle.  A “blissed out” baby's lips part involuntarily, and his
eyeballs roll ecstatically back in his head under flickering
eyelids.  I have only once seen an adult in that condition my
friend Johnny, on the eve of his nuptials to an exquisite
ballerina.  As I recall, they had pretty good “goobers” at that
wedding reception.  “Goober” is, of course, a colloquialisim for
peanut.  We have expanded “goober” to mean any small food,
such as a cocktail sausage or raw vegetable, which is easily
managed by the hands and serves as an appetizer or hors
d'oeuvre.</p>
<p>Granny is probably right when she contends that there is
an essential connection between food and love.  It is perhaps
Freudian that the terms we use for appetite are so closely
related to sexual desire.  In fact, my lusty husband has pronounced
himself “horny” for imported Godiva chocolates and a
cup of espresso very hot, very black.  I myself was once
inspired to quote Ezra Pound's love poetry as I chose an
unusually beguiling lobster from a restaurant tank.  “Your eyes,”
I whispered to my squirming selection, “are my Sargasso Sea.”</p>
<p>Hunger is always accorded the utmost respect in my clan,
on a par with financial insolvency and unrequited love.  During
a trip to Spain, I discovered how satisfying it was to declare
“Tengo hambre.”  My family was enchanted with the translation,
“I have a hunger.” “I am hungry,” we decided, sounds
feeble by comparison.  Now the youthful contingent of the
family has taken up the urgent cry, “Hiyamunger!  We got
hunger!”  This chant is the signal for a pizza to be ordered for
delivery, which reminds me that writing inevitably develops a
ferocious appetite.  What remains of last night's “beast” brisket
dinner beckons me.  I must repair to the refrigerator for a
“pick.”</p>
