They contain\na great deal of information that has been intelligently\ncollated.  The surname dictionary, in particular,\nbecomes the best available work on the subject;\nthe chief value of the first name dictionary, for me,\nlies in the Supplements, which deal with Arabic\nnames (by Mona Baker) and with the given names of\nthe Indian Subcontinent (by Ramesh Krishnamurthy).</p>\n<p>The awkward fact about the surname dictionary\nis that a great many people will consult it in vain for\ninformation about their own names.

Such names must of course be included,\nthough the people most anxious to discover something\nabout the original meaning of their surnames\nare invariably those who bear the rarer names.

Being asked to make a judgment about a surname\nmerely on the basis of its modern spelling is\nrather like being asked to give the meaning of a\nword such as <em>pain</em> without being told whether the\nword is English or French and without knowing\nwhether the word should really be spelled <em>pane</em>.</p>\n<p>I have been using the surname dictionary regularly\nand usually feel satisfied with the information\npresented; but there are criticisms to be made.  Recently,\nfor instance, I was wondering about <em>Boffin</em>, a\nname that obviously appealed to Charles Dickens.\nHanks and Hodges say that it is an English name of\nunknown origin but hint that it may be an anglicization\nof Welsh <em>Baughan</em> (found also as <em>Vaughan</em>), a\ndiminutive of <em>Baugh</em>, ultimately from <em>bach</em> 'little.'  A\ngeneral comment on the treatment of the Welsh <em>ch</em>\nsound in English would have been useful, but I personally\naccept that theory.  I wonder, though, why\nthe <em>Baughan</em> (and <em>Vaughan</em>) entries do not mention\nthat <em>bach</em> was an epithet that distinguished a son and\nfather, a kind of Welsh equivalent of <em>junior</em>.  I also\nhave my doubts about how ordinary users of this dictionary\nwill cope with its metalanguage.  Linguistic\nboffins have no problems with a statement like “dim.\nof BAUGH, from W <em>bychan</em>, hypocoristic form of <em>bach</em>\nlittle.”  But try that on an ordinary member of the\npublic, the kind of person who will presumably consult\nthis book in a library, and add in for good measure\nthe last line of the <em>Baughan</em> entry which reads:\n“Cogn. (of 1): Corn.: BEAN.”  Acting on that last\nhint, I looked at the <em>Bean</em> entry.  I found suggestions\nthat it is a “metonymic occupational name,” an English\nnickname or an anglicized form of a Gaelic personal\nname meaning 'life.'  There was no cross reference\nto <em>Baughan</em>, however, nor a mention of Cornish\n<em>byhan/vyhan</em> 'little.'</p>\n<p>Genealogical information is occasionally added\nto the surname entries, but only when the families\nconcerned are “important” according to a very traditional\ndefinition of that word.  People well-known\nin the entertainment world, such as Frankie\nVaughan, are definitely not mentioned.  Under the\nentry for <em>Howard</em>, therefore, we are given notes on\nthe noble house of that name, along with the possible\nderivations of the surname.  The “noble” theme\nis continued in the first-name dictionary.  Readers\nare there told that <em>Howard</em> represents “transferred\nuse of the surname of an English noble family.”</p>\n<p>Entries like that for <em>Howard</em> in the <em>Dictionary of\nFirst Names</em> hardly encourage me to take the main\nbody of the book seriously.  The absence of hard\nstatistical evidence about the use of first names in\nthe English-speaking world is also very worrying.\nSuch evidence is vital for many reasons.  It enables\nsensible decisions to be made about which names\nshould be included in a work of this kind.  Hanks and\nHodges include <em>Hrothgar</em>, for instance, because it\noccurs in <em>Beowulf</em> and was borne by a vice-chancellor\nof Oxford University at the turn of the century.  I\ndo not consider that a sensible inclusion, especially\nwhen they choose to ignore <em>Hugo</em>, which has been\nregularly if infrequently used in Britain and the US\nsince the 1860s.</p>\n<p>Statistical evidence also indicates the reason for\na name's use.  It is absurd to suggest that <em>Howard</em> has\nbeen used in modern times because it is the surname\nof an aristocratic British family.  The popular use of\nthe name in the US in the 1870s must have been in\nhonor of Oliver Otis Howard (1830-1909), since\nthe surnames of Civil War officers were often used in\nbaptism.  American bearers of the name, such as\n<em>Howard Hughes</em> and <em>Howard Keel</em>, later made the\nname well known to British parents.  Hanks and\nHodges totally ignore such American influence,\nthough the evidence for it is overwhelming.</p>\n<p>The authors' respective treatment of Howard as\na surname and Howard as a first name is perhaps\nsymbolic of the different qualities of these two dictionaries.\nSurname interpretation mainly requires\ngood philological skills, which Hanks and Hodges\nsupply.  First names call for a frequent delving into\nareas of nonacademic, popular culture and recent\nsocial history, as well as a certain amount of linguistic\njudgment.  The student of first names needs an\nenthusiastic and genuine interest in the behavior of\nordinary human beings.  Whatever else is in this Oxford\n<em>Dictionary of First Names</em>, it lacks that basic\nenthusiasm.  It is much the poorer for it.</p>\n<p><em>[Thames Ditton, Surrey]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
