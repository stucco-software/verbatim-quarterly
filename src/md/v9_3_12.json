It also contains an unbelievable\namount of padding, in the form of long lists of what are\nsupposed to be examples.  In one place, for instance, there is a\nthree-page list of words and expressions P.G. Wodehouse\ncontributed to the English language.  In another section,\nBrandeth provides a seventeen-and-a-half-page list of various\nsuffixes to illustrate how “elements appended to words, usually\nto change the part of speech, make a noun into a verb, an\nadjective into an adverb, etc.”  Brandeth says, “I think they\n(i.e., the examples) will give you an idea of how this word\nformation works.”  After seventeen and a half pages of examples,\nif I didn't have an idea of how it worked, I doubt I ever\nwill.</p>\n<p>If you can wade through the first half of the book without\nflinging it down in disgust, you might find the second half\nsomewhat more interesting: it is composed of word games,\npuzzles and quizzes.  Even many of these, however, are hackneyed.\nIn the section under palindromes, for instance,\nBrandeth included the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Able was I ere I saw Elba.<br>\nA man, a plan, a canal-Panama.<br>\nLewd did I live &amp; evil did I dwel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As most students of language will undoubtedly recognize, these\npalindromes are so commonly used that they are hardly worth\ncommenting on.</p>\n<p>In short, this book is not worth the money that is being\nasked for it.  To use a colloquial but apt expression to describe\nit, it is a rip-off.</p>\n<p><em>[Carl Withey, Elbridge, New York]</em></p>",
