(wigs)</em><br>\n<em>Hair To Stay</em>\n<em>Headlines</em><br>\n<em>Headmaster Hairdressers</em><br>\n<em>Minxcrest Ltd.</em><br>\n<em>My Fair Lady</em><br>\n<em>Perfecut Unisex</em><br>\n<em>Shyloks</em><br>\n<em>Snippetts</em><br>\n<em>Under Your Hat</em><br>\n<em>Uppercut</em><br>\n<em>Whiskers</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While in Florida recently, I was reading some\ndetective novels, and the thought struck me that the\nlistings in the Yellow Pages under Detective Agencies\nmight reveal some insights into the real-life Lew Archers\nof the world, especially because, for most of us (I\ntrust) the “knowledge” of how those in and along the\nfringes of the under world use English comes from\nbooks.  Here, for instance, is a passage from <em>Playback,</em> by\nRaymond Chandler:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“... He ain't in his room.  The hotel people ain't\nseen him around.  I thought maybe you and the\ngirl had some ideas about it.”\n“The girl is screwy,” I said.  “Leave her out of it.\n“And in Esmeralda they don't say 'ain't seen.'\nThat Kansas City dialect is an offense against\npublic morals around here.”</p>\n<p>“Shove it, Mac.  When I want to get told how to\ntalk English I won't go to no beat-up California\npeeper.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first listing in the Yellow Pages convinced me\nthat, in spite of my having read hundreds of detective\nnovels, I had apparently learned nothing of the lingo,\nfor I don't know what to make of A <em>Scientific Detection\nof Deception Co.</em>  I'm not exactly sure what it is that is\nconfusing about that collection of words, but they just\ndo not seem to go together—in that order.  Passing by\nthe inevitable <em>Acme, Advance, American, Apex,</em> and\n<em>Authorized</em> set, we come upon <em>Avert Security</em> and\n<em>Investigations.</em>  Why <em>Avert?</em>  One would think that a\ncustomer would want to have security, not avert it.\n<em>Checkmate International Detective Agency</em> advertises\nitself as “one of the nation's most publicized private\ninvestigators,” a seeming contradiction in terms.  Among\nthe services offered (Evidence, Photography, Missing\nPersons—again, one would expect “Finding Persons”\noffered as a service) is Character Analysis.  It is rather\ntoo bad that Sam Spade was not better at character\nanalysis: it might have spared him a lot of grief at the\nhands of Mary Astor.</p>\n<p>Bonafide Detective Agency, which uses Kilroy as a\ntrade mark and spells <em>insurance</em> “insurance,” offers investigation\ninto “Habits Attitudes &amp; Beliefs.”</p>\n<p>Central Detective Bureau is unusual in that it offers\nVoice Stress Analysis.</p>\n<p>Many of the agencies specialize in what they call\nChild Custody, when what they probably mean is Child\nCustody <em>Cases,</em> since none strikes me as suitable for\nbabysitting services.</p>\n<p>At length, I was compelled to turn back to Chandler:\nall the mystery had gone out of the private-eye\nbusiness.</p>\n<p><em>[L.U]</em></p>",
