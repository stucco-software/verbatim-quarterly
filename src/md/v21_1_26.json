It is possible that before the 15th century both the primrose and the cowslip (<em>Primula veris</em>) were regarded as one and the same and called <em>cowslips</em> [Old English <em>cuslippe</em>].

The hybrid between the primrose and the cowslip (<em>Primula veris x vulgaris</em>, sometimes called <em>Primula variabilis</em>) is known as the <em>oxlip</em>. Usually it is called the <em>common oxlip</em> because it occurs quite frequently, but purists prefer to call it the <em>false oxlip</em> since there is a third species, <em>Primula elatior</em>, now found only in the eastern counties of England, which is, for them, the <em>true oxlip</em>. To add to the confusion the <em>true oxlip</em> is also known as the <em>paigle</em>, a name which, in the past, has been rather indiscriminately applied to several wildflowers including buttercups. In some country areas of England <em>paigle</em> (or <em>pagle</em>, or <em>pagyll</em>) is still the local name for the cowslip. It may be derived from the Old English <em>paegle</em> or <em>paegel</em> 'winecup.' This would be most appropriate, since around the time <em>paigle</em> came into use cowslip blooms were used to make a very popular country wine.</p>\n<p>Shakespeare knew of primroses (<em>Cymbeline</em>), cowslips (<em>The Tempest</em>), and oxlips (<em>The Winter's Tale</em>), and presumably the difference between them although there seems to be no way of knowing which oxlip he meant. Wordsworth was, perhaps, less well informed when in his <em>Peter Bell</em> he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A primrose by a river's brim</p>\n<p>A yellow primrose was to him,</p>\n<p>And it was nothing more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It might have been a primrose, although they usually grow in woods and under hedges. A cowslip is rather more likely since they grow in meadows or, of course, it could have been an oxlip. Peter Bell should have taken a closer look.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
