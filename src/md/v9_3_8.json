By Dr. Reinhold Aman, 331 South Greenfield Avenue, Waukesha, Wisconsin 53186, U.S.A.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is rude, ribald, scurrilous, raunchy, funny, uninhibited,\niconoclastic, dirty, and the best sociolinguistic catharsis\nin print?</p>\n<p><em>Benedicta!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reinhold Aman, who could probably qualify as the linguist's\nArchie Bunker (but might deplore the label), has now\narrived with <em>Benedicta</em>, Son of <em>Maledicta</em>.  <em>Benedicta</em> is a\nquarterly newsletter intended to curb the frustrations of the\nsemiannual <em>Maledicta</em> addicts who cannot wait for six months\nbetween issues.  J.P. Donleavy looks like a milquetoast in\ncomparison with Aman's forthrightness, though some may\nthink “forthwrongness” the more appropriate term.  It takes\nballs to publish this sort of thing, and some of <em>Maledicta's</em>\ntestimonials come from people whose language used to be\nsomewhat strained because of their inability to utter four-letter\nwords—until they exposed themselves to the unutterably ineffable\narticles published by its editor.  No dashes or asterisks in\n<em>Benedicta</em>, either; not a dash is to be seen.  Aman sells it like it\nis: all out in the open.</p>\n<p>I know someone whose ancient grandmother, when she\nbecame senile, merely scrunched down among the shawls in\nthe armchair alongside her bed and, with the most benign\nexpression on her face, uttered a never-ending litany of foul\nlanguage.  When I first learned of this phenomenon, I was\nshocked—you know, sweet old ladies simply don't <em>know</em> such\nlanguage!  But later on, reminded of the Paul Bunyan tale of\nthe winter of the blue snow, I concluded that the old lady's\nbrain had finally thawed, releasing all those pent-up, frozen\nwords and expressions she had been storing in her mind all\nthose years.</p>\n<p>Well, between <em>Maledicta</em> and <em>Benedicta</em>, the winter of the\nblue snow has passed, and, with the thaw, it can now be\nrevealed what turned the snow blue.  The slur, especially the\nethnic slur, seems to find its most popular expression in what\nare called Polish jokes in America and Irish jokes in England.\nThat is where the Archie Bunker in all of us comes out.\nWatching Carroll O'Connor on TV is not very different from\nreading parts of <em>Maledicta</em>.  The main difference is that Dr.\nAman is an observer, a collector, and a reporter.  (If he isn't, he\nis worse than Father Coughlin and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn\nrolled into one.)</p>\n<p>The line he walks is a thin one: on the one side, humor (in\nwhich, they say, there is always a smattering of truth); on the\nother, genuine, deep-rooted hate-mongering prejudice.  Aman,\nthe linguist, treads the catwalk of scholar, describing it all but\nremoved from it, as a scholar ought to be.  That doesn't mean\nhe doesn't enjoy his work and go at it with gusto.  Whether you\nwill rejoice and delight in his researches is a matter for you to\ndecide...</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
