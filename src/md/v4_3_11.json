Confusion sometimes arises in pronunciation\nof words ending in “meter.”  If such a word is the\nname of a unit, it is accented on the first syllable, but if\nit is the name of an instrument..., it is accented on\nthe syllable ending in the “m” of “meter.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The stress on the second syllable, -<em>OM</em>eter, is known\neverywhere in the instruments <em>thermometer, barometer, odometer,\nspeedometer, micrometer</em>, and in perhaps fifty others.\nThe word <em>micrometer</em> now seems to be used only to refer to\nthe instrument for measurement, the former usage <em>MI</em>crometer\nnow being supplanted by the word <em>micron</em>.  This gives a clue\nto the reason for the double pronunciation of <em>kilometer</em>.  No\ninstrument is or has been indicated by it, only the unit of\nmeasure.  Thus no confusion can result, whichever accent\nis used.</p>",
