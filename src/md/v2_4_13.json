There are a few other, conventional applications (e.g., the <em>1930's, mind your P's and Q's</em>), but we shall leave those for discussion at another time.</p>\n<p>When we were a child--that construction shows one of the problems one can encounter when dealing with the editorial <em>we</em>--we recall that a friend of our parents' gave them a gift of porous paper coasters imprinted with something like “Drink with the Urdang's.”  Our father (which art, we assume, in Heaven), an English teacher, forbade their use, though they remained in a drawer of the buffet for many years.  Mrs. G.R. Morrow [Swarthmore, Pa.] offers some other examples: <em>Jojos Lounge; The Wilson's telephoned...; ice cold soda's; sandwich's; St. Peters</em> [see VERBATIM II, 1, 3]; and <em>St. Paul United Methodist Church</em> [in Largo, Florida].  These reflect a mixture of the absence of a possessive apostrophe where it belongs and the insertion of an anomalous apostrophe where none is required.</p>\n<p>In other contexts, we see <em>Ham n Eggs, Ham 'n Eggs</em>, and <em>Ham n' Eggs</em>, but only rarely what one might expect because both the <em>a</em> and the <em>d</em> are missing, <em>Ham 'n' Eggs</em>, although we have seen <em>Ham 'n' Eggs</em>, treated as if the <em>n</em> were some special sort of signal.  Clearly, an apostrophe is not to be confused with an open single quotation mark.</p>\n<p>The question of whether or not to use 's to form the possessive of a proper noun ending in <em>s</em> is not always easy to decide, for it depends on the style of a particular piece of work.  Most often, if the proper noun is short--one or two syllables--the <em>s</em> is added after an apostrophe: <em>Van Nuys's downtown area; Tom Jones's house</em>; but there may be a choice between <em>Bill Williams's house</em> and <em>Bill Williams' house</em>.  One hears a conscious choice, too: there is a difference in the sound of <em>Williams'</em> and that of <em>Williams's</em>.</p>\n<p>The apostrophe should never be used when a simple plural of a proper noun ending in <em>s</em> is intended: <em>The Papadopolises are moving tomorrow</em> (not “Papadopolis' ” or “Papadopolis's”); <em>keeping up with the Joneses</em> (not “Jones' ” or “Jones's”).  One area of confusion remains, however, when we encounter what might be called the “possessive absolute.”  That is a construction in which the object of the possessive has been omitted: <em>We are going over to the Joneses' [house] tonight</em>.  Another kind of example: <em>“Whose lawn mower is that?”  /“It's the Joneses.</em>' ”</p>\n<p>Our best advice is avoidance: if an uncomfortable construction is encountered, and you don't know how to handle it, avoid it.  Many copy editors and stylists frown on the use of the possessive apostrophe with proper nouns, preferring an <em>of the</em>...construction, where possible. In some instances, that may be awkward, but for the most part it is less burdensome to write (if not say): <em>the downtown area of Van Nuys</em> rather than <em>Van Nuys's downtown area; the exports of the Netherlands Antilles</em> rather than <em>the Netherlands Antilles'</em> [or <em>Antilles's</em>] <em>exports</em>, and so on.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
