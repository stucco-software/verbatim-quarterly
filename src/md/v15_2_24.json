Bland makes\none error for sure, and, if I read him rightly, yet another\nin the same spot.  He refers to those chilling lines\nat the end of III.ii, where Macbeth invokes Night's\ncover for the intended murder of Banquo.  Bland slips\nup when he states it is to “enable him to proceed on\nhis path to the murder of Duncan.”  Your Third Prize\nnotwithstanding, Duncan was murdered several pages\nearlier.</p>\n<p>The serious error is in his (apparently) thinking\nthat Macbeth's</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cancel, and tear to pieces, that great bond<br>\nWhich keeps me pale!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>relates to night destroying daylight in the sense that\ndarkness will cancel the daylight's 'bond,' whatever\nthat may be.  No, the bond here is Banquo's lease on\nlife and his fatherhood, with <em>great</em> alluding to the\nsupernatural powers of the witches, especially the\nThird Witch.  It is she who had addressed Macbeth, in\nI. ii, as “that shalt be king hereafter.”  A few lines later\nshe confounds him by prophesying that Banquo shall\n“get kings.”  Macbeth harps on this mystery after the\nwitches vanish, muttering to Banquo in a tone of envious\nwonderment, “Your children shall be kings.”</p>\n<p>In the tyrant's mind, <em>that great bond</em> really means\nBanquo/Fleance, both subject to the bonded prophecy\nuttered by the Third Witch.  The father can beget new\noffspring safe from Macbeth's hand; the son is the palpable\nthreat.  Both their lives must be snuffed out immediately,\nor the usurper will remain paralyzed, kept\npale, by that unearthly promise.  He views either of\nthem as the instrument, the bond, of his not being able\nto pass on the crown to a successor of his choosing (or\nof his subsequent begetting).  Yes, Night will devour\nDay, but Macbeth's significant meaning here is: under\ncover of darkness—in reckless defiance of weird authority—he\nwill have his black agents eliminate the\nbonded progenitor of Scottish kings, along with his\nonly progeny.  As it turns out, Fleance escapes to fulfill\nthe prophecy of Banquo begetting a line of kings.\nMacbeth's action to have the bond canceled becomes\nnull and void.</p>\n<p>True to the terms of the indenture set forth by its\nguarantors, that great bond will suffer no default.</p>\n<p><em>[Robert D.
