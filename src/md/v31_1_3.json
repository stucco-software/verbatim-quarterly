Of these the first three come to us via Portuguese; but far more words enter American English from Spanish, to the point of being so thoroughly absorbed that we do not think of them as foreign at all, such as <em>latigo</em> (a type of strap used in saddlery; in Spanish <em>látigo</em> means 'thong of a whip'), <em>hidalgo</em> ('nobleman,' a contraction of <em>hijo de algo</em>, 'son of somebody [sc. not a nobody]'), <em>amigo</em> ('friend'),  <em>lingo</em> ('language'), and <em>gringo</em> ('Yankee').<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-a27\" id=\"user-content-fnref-a27\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">27</a></sup></p>\n<p>The previous examples attest to the mutual permeability of Spanish and English in the American Southwest during a history stretching back several hundred years, from colonial and territorial periods through statehood.

Duncan had been an industrial administrator for the Marshall Plan in Italy, and presided over the rebirth of such firms as Fiat and Pirelli.  Later, under his leadership, Sterling Precision got renamed Steego and began being traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  “After selling Steego in 1988,” the <em>Daily News</em> obit adds, “he retained a small division that he built into Milastar Corp., which he served as chairman until his death.”  How Duncan settled on the Steego name is not known, but it was certainly more memorable than its predecessor, which could easily have been confused with any number of other similarly named firms (e.g., Waltham Precision Instruments, successor to the Waltham Watch Company, which, during its Civil War heyday of producing cheap but reliable soldiers' watches, had earned Waltham, Mass., the nickname “Watch City”). <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a4\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 4\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a5\">\n<p>Its company website URL is, not surprisingly, <em><a href=\"http://www.pergo.com\">www.pergo.com</a></em>. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a5\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 5\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a6\">\n<p>Or has never heard its slogan, <em>Leggo my Eggo!</em>  According to the <em>Columbia Encyclopedia</em> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1975, p. 247), Dr. J. H. Kellogg founded the Health Reform Institute at Battle Creek, Mich., in 1866, and W. K. Kellogg began manufacturing Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flakes in 1906.  (For a concise official history of the Kellogg corporate family, see <em><a href=\"http://investor.kelloggs.com/history.cfm\">http://investor.kelloggs.com/history.cfm</a></em>.)  But Eggo is also the name of a recruitment agency for technical personnel, based in Paris, France (website: <em>perso.wanadoo.fr/eggo.conseils</em>), and of another company billing itself as “a top management consulting firm focused on innovation” <em>(<a href=\"http://www.eggo.com\">www.eggo.com</a>)</em> at an unspecified location in the United States.  And why Eggo?  The French company is mum on this; the American one states that “[t]he name Eggo comes from our belief that innovation must be people driven, as opposed to technology driven,” a derivation that we suspect most readers will find no more self-evident than it seemed to us. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a6\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 6\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a7\">\n<p>Just as <em>Eggo</em> must not be confused with <em>ego</em> (Latin for 'I,' and Sigmund Freud's term for the more or less rational adult in his tripartite model of the human psyche), <em>prego</em> (Italian for '[if you] please') is not the same as <em>preggo</em> (synonymous with <em>preggers</em>, both being vulgar diminutives for 'pregnant'): <em>Prego</em> is from Latin <em>precor</em>, a deponent verb (passive construction with active sense) meaning 'I entreat/beg.' There are, it should be noted, a great many Latin verbs whose first person singular indicative active form ends with <em>-go</em>, such as <em>rogo</em>, 'I ask/beg' (<em>Rogation Days</em> in the Catholic and Episcopal church calendars are days of prayer, especially for a good harvest), <em>ago</em>, 'I do/make' (whose first syllable is accented, in contradistinction to the English adverb/adjective <em>agó</em>) and its negative, <em>nego</em>, 'I deny/refuse,' <em>fingo,</em> 'I make/fashion,' and <em>pingo</em>, 'I paint' (whose past participles <em>fictus</em> and <em>pictus</em> give us <em>fiction</em> and <em>Picts</em> respectively).  <em>Frango</em> means 'I break,' <em>spargo</em>, 'I scatter,' <em>pungo</em>, 'I punch/prick' (this gives English a host of words including <em>point</em> and <em>pungent</em>), <em>fugo</em>, 'I put to flight' (the same root yields <em>fugio</em>, 'I flee'), and <em>plango</em>, 'I beat (my breast)/lament' (whence <em>complaint</em>). The state motto of Maine is <em>Dirigo</em>, 'I direct' (originally 'I align/lay out straight'). <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a7\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 7\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a8\">\n<p>The Pogo stick, according to one of its manufacturers (the American Pogo Stick Company, in Marina del Rey, Calif., <em><a href=\"http://www.pogostickusa.com/history.htm\">http://www.pogostickusa.com/history.htm</a>),</em> is supposed to have been named after a pious Burmese peasant girl named Pogo, who “wanted to go to temple every day to pray, but couldn't because she had no shoes to wear for the long walk through the mud and rocks.” So her farmer father built her a jumping stick, which allowed her to bounce her way to the temple and back. George Hansburg saw the device while traveling in the Far East and on his return to America determined to go into business making his own version, which added a metal spring for additional bounce.   He obtained a patent for what he dubbed the Pogo Stick in 1919, starting a craze during the 1920s that included a Pogo-stick chorus line in the Ziegfeld Follies, Pogo-stick marriage ceremonies, and Pogo-stick marathons to set and break world records for most consecutive bounces.  Hansburg would continue to make Pogo sticks for the next 50 years before selling the company and retiring in the early 1970s. There is no connection between his invention and <em>Pogo Possum</em>, Walt Kelly's beloved cartoon character, who is discussed in affectionate detail on the website of Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp Park (<a href=\"http://www.okeswamp.com/ral_InfoPogo_and_the_Walt_Kelly_Museum/*pogo_and_the_walt_kelly_museum.html\">www.okeswamp.com/ral_InfoPogo_and_the_Walt_Kelly_Museum/*pogo_and_the_walt_kelly_museum.html</a>).* The liberal Kelly's slogan “I Go Pogo” parodied then-dominant Republican culture's “I Like Ike,” which propelled World War II general Dwight D.

But popular hope of a “Second Charlemagne” who would be the emperor of the Last Days and usher in a thousand-year reign of peace was dimmed by the Hundred Years War: “The France which emerged from the great effort of reconstruction…was a monarchy centralized to the point of despotism” (107). Nevertheless, “the tense expectation of a final, decisive struggle in which a world tyranny will be overthrown by a 'chosen people' and through which the world will be renewed and history brought to its consummation…continued a dim, subterranean existence down the centuries, flaring up briefly in the margins of…the French Revolution” (285), this time with <em>le roi Louis</em> cast not as the people's savior from tyranny but as the arch-tyrant himself. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-a17\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 17\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-a18\">\n<p>As told in the third chapter of the biblical book of Daniel and the up-tempo gospel song “Shadrach,” recorded by Louis Armstrong on his <em>Louis and the Good Book</em> LP (Decca, 1958) and earlier on 78-rpm shellac by the Golden Gate Quartet.
