Baugh and Thomas Cable, (Routledge, 1993.

To those wont to steep themselves in the writings of the 19th century, a period marked by an emergence of scholarship and of the broad dissemination of knowledge, plumbing the delights of those writings not only for their content but for their controlled and mannered style yields great satisfaction. One must be especially grateful to those who, rather than cast it aside as old-fashioned or outdated, undertake to modernize a classic, a policy that too few publishers pursue.</p>\n<p>For me and scores of thousands of other students of language and literature, A.C. Baugh's book was the primer, the basic grammar on the history of English. Long before the invention of the cliché <em>user-friendly</em>, that was an apt description of the <em>Baugh</em>, a work to be relied upon for substance, accuracy, readability. Later, it became a useful reference, always handy on a nearby shelf, to which one could turn in those irritating lapses of memory of the niggling detail.</p>\n<p>The first edition of Baugh's <em>History</em> was published in 1935; because so much has happened to English since then, it is fitting that its history be updated, not only to reflect more recent developments in dialect, lexicon, grammatical theory, and the universal adoption of the language as a lingua franca, but also to revise scholarship in the light of later research that either elaborates or confutes information that is now more than half a century old. Although I was surprised to note (on the title page) that this is the fourth edition of the work, ignorance of the second and third editions must be put down to my own failing. The present editor, Professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin, has exercised restraint in meddling with Baugh's original text, having focused mainly on those areas—dialect, modern grammatical theory, and, generally, the work of later scholars—that could not have been treated in 1935. It is suggested that the next edition include a more comprehensive section on dictionaries, perhaps of lesser importance in earlier times but increasingly the chief source of information about language for most people, reflected in a recent report that more people own a dictionary than a Bible.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
