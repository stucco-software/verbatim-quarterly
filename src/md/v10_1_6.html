<p>Edward D. Johnson (Facts on File, 1982), x + 309 pp.</p>
<p>Time was when one could write or publish a dictionary or
other book dealing with language, reasonably secure in the
knowledge that those who bought it and used it would be
guided by the information it contained on spelling, pronunciation,
meaning, usage, and so on.  Increasingly, we receive letters
from teachers complaining about students who are so ignorant
that (a) they haven't even the foggiest notion that there might
be something awry in their spelling, grammar, or usage, and (b)
even if they have doubts are so ill equipped that they are
incapable of spelling a word correctly, hence cannot look it up.
There is nothing wrong with the book under review except the
following assumptions on which it is based:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The user suspects that something may be wrong with
what he has written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The userâif he does suspect something amissâcan find
the part of the book relating to his question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The userâif the two foregoing prove trueâis capable of
understanding the advice given.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of what use is it to write of adjectives and adverbs when
manyâthose, in fact, who need most to knowâhaven't the
slightest idea of what adjectives and adverbs (or, for that
matter, nouns and verbs and prepositions, etc.) are?  The good
advice, “Do not put a comma between an adjective or adverb
and a following word or phrase that it modifies.  When an
adjective or adverb follows the modified word, usually set off
the adjective, but not the adverb, with a pair of commas” is
totally lost on those who are unfamiliar with the terms used.
Can you imagine such people dealing with words like <em>adjectival,
compound</em>, and <em>participle</em>?  This book abounds in such
nasty terms.  Even though there is a glossary (in which <em>adjective</em>,
but not <em>adjectival</em>, is defined), that can be of little help to
those who do not know the alphabet.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the sound advice given in this book is not
likely to reach those who need it.  Those of you who do not
need it may wish to buy it because it contains direct, easy-to-follow
counsel based on the philosophy expressed by the author
in the opening line of the Introduction: “This book is strict
rather than permissive, because it assumes that those who
consult it want to be protected from criticism.”  I have no
quarrel with that.  If I must nitpick, it is with the sparse
treatment (Rule 1-7) of the possessive with the gerund (vs. the
objective with the participle).  That is a fine point, and the
author, who is certainly not incorrect in his view, would have
prepared his argument better had he adduced more examples
instead of writing, “But often there is a difference in meaning,
and then the distinction [between possessive + gerund and
objective + participle] is worthwhile.”</p>
<p>Another matter on which I should take issue is the
comment, “Do not usually consider <em>the</em> part of a periodical's
name.”  Examples follow, including a set showing the results of
the author's own judgment.  In my opinion, the article is either
part of the proper name of the periodical or it is not: when it
is, it should be treated as the title is treated (underlined or
italicized); when it is not, it shouldn't be.</p>
