David Grambs, an editor\nof the <em>Random House Dictionary</em> (which I once had\nsome remote connection with), has collected about 500\n“succinct, knockout sobriquets and epithets” (according\nto the back-cover blurb), which are arranged into\ntwenty-four categories, from Dentiloquists, Leptorrhinians\n&amp; Pithecoids, through Blateroons, Energumens\n&amp; Solipsists, to Mumpsimuses, Parvanimities\n&amp; Solitudinarians.  The descriptive definitions are\nwell done (though the entries be rare), and if you are\nsearching for another way to refer to the people whom\nyou have traditionally characterized as gormless\nninnyhammers and attocerebral twits, perhaps this\nbook is the solution.  The definitions are blithe and\noften funny, with many esoteric, exotic words buried\ninside them, each (I believe) with its own definition.</p>\n<p>Paul Hellweg's book also contains lexicographic\nrarities, but of a different sort; moreover, it is organized\nthematically in a somewhat more productive\nway—that is, if you cannot think of (or don't know)\nthe word for excessive sexual desire in men (the counterpart\nof <em>nymphomania</em>), you can find it by scanning\na short list of Erotic Manias, a subset of Chapter IV,\nManifestly Manifold Manias, which boasts of listing\n277 manias, “the largest list in print anywhere.”  This\ncan readily be made 278 by the addition of a mania\nlisted in most self-respecting dictionaries of any size—\n<em>tulipomania</em>.  Maybe it's there, but <em>The Insomniac's\nDictionary</em>, unfortunately, has no index and there is\nno quick way of again finding a word once encountered\nin the text.  The categorization of the contents is\nconvenient and would usually enable a user to find the\nword he may be seeking—I say “may be” because\nthere are, buried in the linguistic debris that is documented\nhere, many words that could well be useful\nand, indeed, may be sought.  Generally, the book is a\npotpourri of lexicographic matter—eponyms, longest\nwords, acronyms, -<em>cide</em> words (those are real killers),\nand so on.  Hellweg has published some of this material\nin <em>Word Ways</em>, The Journal of Recreational Linguistics.\nIf you are unfamiliar with <em>Word Ways</em>, you can\nfind out more by writing to A. Ross Eckler, Spring\nValley Road, Morristown, NJ 07960.</p>\n<p>I cannot allow one egregious error in Hellweg's\nbook to slip past without comment: like some others\nbefore him, he attributes <em>supercallifragilisticexpialidocious</em>\n(or, as he has it, -<em>cali</em>-) to the movie <em>Mary\nPoppins</em>.  Although the word does appear in a song in\nthat film, I (and my contemporaries) knew the word\nvery well in the 1930s, long before Disney made the\nmovie.  I haven't the slightest idea where it came from,\nbut it was “going around” when I was a lad, and I\nshould hope that whoever wrote the lyrics for the song\nwould acknowledge that he or she did not coin the\nword.  Perhaps, though, the lyricist has more information\non its provenance.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
