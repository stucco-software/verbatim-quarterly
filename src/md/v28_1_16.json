It's refreshing to see that Fiske does not just dispose of tired clichés and wordy phrases, but instead proposes sensible alternatives, and often includes example sentences. (And yes, I checked to be sure “tired clichés” wasn't on his list.) My only qΩuibble is that I would have preferred to have both books in a single volume, to save tedious flipping from one to the other.</p>\n<p>—<em>Erin McKean</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
