The deck planking is laid fore and aft; the\noutboard plank must curve to conform to the plan view of\nthe deck.  The inboard edge of this plank, therefore, must be\nnotched to receive the butt ends of the deck planking, in a\nlong zigzag pattern.  This notching is usually done by hand\nand is complicated by the fact that it is a compound curve,\nto allow for the sheer of the hull.  It rarely can be made to\ncome out exactly right, and the <em>devil</em> is consequently a wide\nand somewhat irregular seam.</p>\n<p>To be caught <em>between the devil and the deep blue sea</em>,\ntherefore, is to be 'balanced precariously on the outboard\nplank itself.'  This is not the equivalent of Scylla and Charybdis,\nhowever, since the devil in this case represents safety, in\nthe form of a step back.  The phrase properly refers to a situation\nin which only moving <em>forward</em> will lead to disaster,\nand a prudent retreat is indicated.  Popular (or more properly,\nlubberly) usage has long since converted the phrase to\nthe usage which Mr. Lederer assigns it, and few if any of the\npopular compendiums of phrases or usage give the correct\ndefinition.</p>\n<p>This definition of <em>devil</em> also figures in another well-known\nphrase that has also suffered a lubberly sea-change.\nWhen a seam is caulked to make it watertight, oakum is first\ndriven into the seam with a caulking iron.  (Oakum is\nacquired by picking apart old, frayed rope fragments; while\nin Reading Gaol, Oscar Wilde was set to picking oakum.)\nThe seam is then sealed by “paying” it—pouring hot pitch\nover the oakum from a funnel.</p>\n<p>Actually, two seams aboard ship were so difficult to\ncaulk properly that they were universally known as the <em>devils</em>.\nThe first was the outboard deck seam referred to above,\nwhich could rarely be caulked and paid neatly.</p>\n<p>The second <em>devil</em> was the <em>garboard seam</em> in the hull\nplanking, between the keel and the garboard strake—the\nbottom strake of the hull planking.  This seam was not only\neven more difficult to fit properly than the outboard deck\nplank (since it involved several compound curves), but was\nimpossible to get at once the ship was afloat.  It was the seam\nwhere leaks invariably started and couldn't be reached from\ninboard because of the ballast (in the old days, gravel)\nwhich covered it.  To caulk the garboard seam the ship had\nto be put in drydock, or beached and careened—and even\nthen caulking was difficult if not impossible, as the working\nof the hull continually opened the seam.</p>\n<p><em>The devil to pay and no pitch hot</em> thus described a nautical\ncrisis, and generally referred to a hopeless situation, in\nwhich looming disaster could not be averted.</p>\n<p>This phrase was frequently abbreviated to <em>there was\nthe devil to pay</em>, and since this sounded affected to landlubbers\n(who had adopted it in the process Mr. Lederer\ndescribes), it was converted in the last century to “there was\n<em>hell</em> to pay,” after which the nautical significance of “pay”\nwas lost.</p>\n<p>Hanson Baldwin, a naval expert, in referring to a\ntyphoon, once used the phrase “To quote an old nautical\nexpression, 'there was hell to pay and no pitch hot,' ” and he\nhas not been alone in this compounded solecism.  Even the\n<em>OED</em>, while correctly identifying the nautical devil, gives as\nan undated explanation of <em>the devil to pay</em>: “supposed to\nrefer to bargains made by wizards, etc., with Satan, and the\ninevitable payment (!) in the end.”</p>\n<p><em>[Donald R.
