If one is visiting a foreign country,\nsuch a book is particularly useful because it helps\nin the naming of familiar (and some unfamiliar)\nobjects.  I vividly recall, for instance, my first visit to\nFrance.  I had studied French for many years and\ncould speak and understand it quite well.  But, while I\ncould discuss Racine and Baudelaire, I had no idea\nhow to ask a chambermaid to get my laundry done\nand had not encountered, in reading the great French\nclassics, the words for <em>toothpaste</em> or <em>light switch</em>.  A\n<em>Duden</em> would have shown me a detailed drawing of a\nbathroom, with all accessories numbered, and the legend\nopposite would have provided their names in\nFrench, German, or a variety of other languages.\nUnfortunately, I did not have one; sign language\nyielded <em>le linge</em>, but my pocket dictionary revealed\nthat that meant 'linen.'  As I wanted to enquire about\npersonal laundry, not (bed) linen, I was confused, for\nnone of my clothing was made out of linen.  But then,\nneither was the bed linen, and that had never confused\nme.  Well, anyway....</p>\n<p>The <em>FOF Visual Dictionary (VD)</em> is something\nlike the <em>Duden</em> series but it is not as good.  In the first\nplace, there are errors, and from those I found in a\nbrief browse, they are not rare.  For example, under\n<em>family ties</em>, a two-page spread where I was disappointed\nnot to find things like <em>third cousin once\nremoved</em> and <em>cousin german</em> explained, the male and\nfemale illustrations are switched for the parents'\nbrothers—that is, the brother is called a wife/aunt-in-law,\nthe sister-in-law is called a husband/uncle-in-law.\nBesides, just whose aunt- and uncle-in-law these\npeople are is unclear; and, finally, what is an aunt-in-law/uncle-in-law?\nA few dictionaries I checked were\nnot forthcoming with entries.</p>\n<p>Under <em>Communications</em> is a page on proofreading\nthat contains some errors which are too boring to\nretail here.  On the <em>one-design sailboat</em> the bow and\nstern are unmarked, the <em>spreader</em> is incorrectly named\n“crosstree,” the <em>preventer</em> is misnamed the “vang,” the\n<em>spinnaker boom</em> is rigged without any spinnaker\nshown, and the <em>telltale</em> is attached to the mainsail,\nwhere it is less likely to be as useful as on the jib.  Also,\nthere are many other parts that are unidentified.  In a\nsection called <em>upperworks</em>, a term unfamiliar to me, a\nchock is called a <em>fairlead</em>, the function of a <em>hank</em> is not\nclear, nor is that of a <em>turnbuckle</em>, and what we on the\nEast Coast call a <em>jam cleat</em> is identified as a “clam\ncleat.”  All in all, sailing and sailboats are only sparsely\ncovered.  Under <em>heraldry</em>, the terms <em>crescent, fleur-delis</em>,\nand <em>mullet</em>, which are properly ordinaries, are\nlabeled charges, and <em>lion passant</em> and <em>eagle</em>, which are\nproperly cadence marks, are also labeled charges.  The\nequipment list for the <em>scuba diver</em> omits the <em>regulator</em>,\na vital piece of gear.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding such shortcomings, the book\ncontains a great deal of miscellaneous information\nwhich might be hard to come by if one has no multivolume\nencyclopedia to hand.  The only problem is\nthat, having encountered errors of the type documented,\nmy faith in anything the book has to offer is\nvery much shaken, and were I to rely (albeit tentatively)\non the <em>VD</em> as a source, I should feel compelled\nto look up a given term and verify its accuracy in a\ngood dictionary or encyclopedia.  I am slightly puzzled\nby the difference(s) between the French and English\nchessboards: except for a minor difference in the silhouette\nof the bishop symbol, they seem identical.</p>\n<p>The greatest compliment I can pay is to <em>VD's</em>\nindexes: in four columns of tiny type they cover 85\npages, showing all terms in one alphabetical order,\nthen thematically arranged, and finally organized by\nspecial subjects.</p>\n<p>The illustrations are generally clear, especially for\nthe simpler and diagrammatic matter, but they tend\nto get confusing for things like <em>gasoline engine</em>, where\nit is hard to tell where the edges of the cutaway views\nbegin and end.  Occasionally, extraneous items creep\nin: What has a <em>water bottle</em> (or, indeed, a <em>water bottle\nclip</em>) to do with a bicycle (especially one without a bell\nor horn)?  Of what use is a drawing of a <em>station hall</em>\n(which is, for Americans at least, an odd name for a\nrailway station)?  This particularly silly illustration\nshows a <em>change machine</em> and—unlikely to be found in\nmost stations—a currency exchange office.  Where are\nthe public phones?  the restrooms?  the bagladies?  the\ndrunks?  the litter?  the overflowing waste containers?\nThe <em>airport passenger terminal</em>, curiously, shows an\n<em>automatically-controlled [sic] door</em> as well as the services\nusually found only at international airports.  I can\neasily see the usefulness of the office supplies section: a\nnew employee who may know English well may have\nno idea of what to call a <em>scratch pad</em>, a <em>coat tree</em>, or a\n<em>book end</em>.  But I have never heard of a <em>swivel-tilter\narmchair</em> (only a <em>swivel chair</em>), and it is somewhat\nludicrous to show a series of boxes from which one is\nsupposed to identify various components of computer\nhardware.  Not only that, but the scale is all wrong,\nwith a <em>microprocessor</em> (which is a couple of inches\nlong and looks like a mechanical centipede) made to\nappear to be about one quarter the size of an entire\ncentral processing unit (represented as a rectangular\nbox with some vents and a black dot on one side).  At\nthis point, the exercise is virtually useless and would\nbest have been ignored.  At the more primitive end of\nthe technological spectrum, <em>letterpress, intaglio</em>, and\n<em>planographic printing</em>, which the huge printing industry\nin America will be interested to find under Creative\nLeisure Activities, are covered in only the crudest\nway, with offset lithography and typesetting ignored\nentirely.</p>\n<p>To sum up, there is a lot in this book, but there is\na great deal missing.  Much of what is here can be\nfound elsewhere, particularly in <em>The Way Things\nWork</em>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, which ought to\nbe a sufficient source of information for this sort of\nthing when referred to alongside a good encyclopedia.\nTalking about encyclopedias, there are a number of\ntypographical errors in the Selective Bibliography,\namong them “Encyclopedia” for <em>Encyclopaedia\nBritannica</em>, Mitchell “Beazleg” for <em>Beazley, McGraw-Hill\nEncyclopedia of Science @ [sic] Technology</em>,\n“Chamber's” for <em>Chambers's</em>, etc.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
