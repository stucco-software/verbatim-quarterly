Divided into 16 chapters, which are\ngrouped into five major sections, each dealing with a\ndifferent aspect of language, this readable book could\nserve as a useful preliminary to the study of linguistics\n--possibly as an introductory text or as supplementary\nreading in secondary-school English classes. Even\nwithout such pretensions, it offers a mature point of\nview about many sides of linguistic theory, touching\non such interesting matters as “Linguistic Chauvinism,”\nnonverbal communication, and the language of children.\nThis reviewer recommends it as required reading\nfor any who persist in pursuing unscientific prejudices\nabout language.</p>",
