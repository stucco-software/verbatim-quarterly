It was then\npassed to a Vietnamese office, which a week later returned\nit, politely reporting that they couldn't make\nhead or tail of it.

She\nwas to ask any questions she wanted to, and when she\nunderstood the passage, she was to render it freely into\nVietnamese, without attempting to make a verbatim\ntranslation.  It worked beautifully.</p>\n<p>In the course of the first session with Mrs. Ban,\nthe word <em>cipher</em> came up; she did not understand it.  I\nstarted to explain, and then noticed a copy of <em>The\nSaturday Review</em> on my desk.  “Here,” I said, turning\nto the Literary Cryptogram.  “This is a cipher.  It's a\nshort quotation from some well-known author, with\nhis name.  For every letter, another one has been substituted,\nso you can't read it.  You have to puzzle it out.”</p>\n<p>She picked up the magazine, inspected the cryptogram,\nfrowned, nodded, and left the office.  She was\nback within fifteen minutes with the correct solution\ninked in over the mono-alphabetical cipher.  I was\nstunned.</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Ban,” I said, “Very few Americans could\nwork that out without being taught how to go about\nit.  Would you mind explaining how you did it?”</p>\n<p>“Sure.  You say name is well-known author.  Name\nis XQ PLRZADLTRQTXF.  I look at first name, two letters.\nOnly American first names with two letters are <em>Ed</em> and\n<em>Al</em>, and you got no famous writers in America or England\nnamed <em>Ed</em> or <em>Al</em>.  So I think maybe <em>particule</em>—“De”\nor “La”—hey!  Maybe “La Rochefoucauld\n!”  And, yes, <em>ls, as, os</em>, and <em>us</em> all come out in right\nplace.  So I write in up above, and rest is easy.  Fun!  You\ngot more?”</p>\n<p>I gave her a raise on the spot.</p>\n<p><em>[Donald R. Morris, The Houston Post]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
