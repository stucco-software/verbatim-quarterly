We all know about <em>The\nTatler</em> and one or two others and might even have\nread essays from them by Addison and Steele.  But\nmany people interested in such things have never\nheard of <em>Gentleman's Magazine, Notes and Queries,\nThe Edinburgh Review, Century Magazine</em>, and others\nthat provided intellectuals with a worldwide\ncommunications network on such diverse subjects as\nShakespeariana, Danteiana, the origin of visiting\ncards, the etymologies of words like <em>punch, noyade,</em>\nand <em>ha-ha</em>, amendments and emendations to the <em>Dictionary\nof National Biography</em>, showers of frogs, pub\nnames, usage and grammar, ancient customs, superstitions,\nlaw, dialecticisms, rhyming slang,\nand the longevity of horses.  <em>Notes and Queries</em> (then\na weekly, more recently a quarterly published by\nOxford University Press) carried, appropriately\nenough, a department called Queries and another\ncalled Replies, and the perseverance and loyalty of\nreaders can be judged by the fact that in some instances,\nthe interval between a Reply and a Query\nmight be more than a quarter century.  One of\nthese—indeed, it might be able to claim credit for\nhaving the longest record of continuous publication\nanywhere in the world—was <em>Gentleman's Magazine,</em>\na monthly, published from 1747 till early in the\ntwentieth century.  I derive enormous enjoyment\nfrom reading through back issues of such periodicals,\na rather formidable prospect when you consider\nthat each year makes up two volumes of about\n400-odd pages each.  Let me give you some idea of\nthe content in the following extracts:</p>\n<p>In the issue for February 1822 there appeared\nthe obituary of Thomas Coutts, aged 87, “the well-known\nbanker in the Strand.  In the next issue, under\n“Anecdotes of the Late Thomas Coutts, Esq.,”\nappeared the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The late Mr. Coutts was the youngest of four\nsons of John Coutts, esq. merchant at Edinburgh.\n... The following account of Mr. John Coutts\nand his family were [<em>sic</em>] communicated by the\nearl of Dundonald to the editor of the Morning\nPost, in refutation of anecdotes published in a\npamphlet, entitled “Life of Thomas Coutts,” &amp;c.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Thomas Coutts married a daughter of Sir\nJohn Stuart, of Allan Bank, in Berwickshire, and\nSir John Stuart's mother was a daughter of Mr.\nKer, of Morrison, in the same county; and Mr.\nKer's mother was Miss Grizzle Cochrane, daughter\nof Sir John Cochrane, second son of William,\nfirst Earl of Dundonald.</p>\n<p>“A singular circumstance attended this Lady,\nwhich may not be generally known, but deserves\nto be recorded as an almost unexampled instance\nof female heroism and filial affection.  I cannot exactly\nascertain whether the fact I am about to relate\nhappened before or after her marriage with\nMr. Ker, of Morrison—I rather think it was previous\nto that event.</p>\n<p>“Sir John Cochrane, being engaged in Argyle's\nRebellion against James the Second [of Scotland—that\nis, James I of England], was taken prisoner\nafter a desperate resistance, and condemned\nto be hanged.  His daughter having noticed that\nthe death-warrant was expected from London, attired\nherself in men's clothes, and twice attacked\nand robbed the mails (between Belford and Berwick),\nwhich conveyed the death-warrants; thus,\nby delaying the execution, giving time to Sir John\nCochrane's father, the Earl of Dundonald, to\nmake interest with Father Peter (a Jesuit), King\nJames's Confessor, who, for the sum of five thousand\npounds [something like $5 million today],\nagreed to intercede with his Royal Master in favour\nof Sir John Cochrane, and to procure his\npardon; which was effected.  Her great granddaughter,\nMiss Stuart of Allan Bank, married the\nlate Mr. Thomas Coutts's father, and brought him\nfour sons—Peter, John, James, and Thomas.  [Mr.\nJohn Coutts (the father) died July 29, 1761.]</p>\n<p>[<em>The Gentleman's Magazine</em>, March 1822]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The 1890s were marked by the publication, in\nfascicles [“parts”], of what is now called <em>The Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary</em> but was then referred to, variously,\nas <em>The New English Dictionary</em> [<em>N.E.D.</em>] and\n<em>The Historical English Dictionary</em> [<em>H.E.D.</em>].  As only\nthe earlier letters were gradually becoming available,\nit is amusing to note, in the correspondence\npublished in <em>Notes and Queries</em>, Replies evoked by\nQueries that direct the questioner to stop wasting\nspace in <em>N. and Q.</em> and go look up the answer in the\n<em>N.E.D.</em></p>\n<p>The editor of the <em>N.E.D.</em>, J.A.H. Murray, often\nasked readers for help, particularly for dialect information\nabout certain words and expressions and occasionally\ncommented on Queries.</p>\n<p>A sampling of some of the language topics considered\nand debated included:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>pronunciation of <em>water, golf, iron</em></p>\n<p>origin of <em>infra dig, take the cake, blackball, sand\nhog, Dutch courage, hoodlum(ism), horse latitudes,\nflotsam, jetsam, apple-pie bed/apple-pie\norder, jingo</em></p>\n<p>whether <em>none</em> is singular or plural</p>\n<p>condemnation of <em>awful</em> and <em>awfully, preventative,\ntaxidermist, transpire</em>, of Latin and Greek\nsources for new words (e.g., <em>telephone</em>),\n<em>lengthy</em> (as an Americanism)</p>\n<p>spelling reform</p>\n<p>mnemonics</p>\n<p>names</p>\n<p>nicknames (e.g., <em>Poet of the Poor</em> (George\nCrabbe), <em>Attic Bee</em> (Sophocles), <em>Madman of\nthe North</em> (Charles XII of Sweden), <em>Manchester\nPoet</em> (Charles Swain), <em>Great Prussian Drill-sergeant</em>\n(Frederick William I), etc.)</p>\n<p>pseudo-French (e.g., <em>double entendre, nom de\nplume, à l'outrance, en déshabille, laissezfaire,\nlevée</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A typical exchange:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the entrance to the baths at Spa are the\nwords: “Pentru Barbati.”  Will someone tell me\nwhat language that is?  Strange to say, they do\nnot know either at the baths or at the hotel.</p>\n<p>—8th S. IV, Oct. 14, '93:308</p>\n<p><em>Pentru barbati</em> sont deux mots de la langue\nroumane; ils signifient “pour hommes” (for gentlemen).</p>\n<p>—8th S. IV, Oct, 28, '93:308</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is Murray:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As several correspondents have written to me\nasking if I really wrote the words “an historical,”\nas printed in my guery on 'Corduroy' last week, I\nhope that I shall be allowed to say that I did not.\nI wrote, as I always do, “a historical,” which I\nconsider to be better modern English, though\nmany scholars prefer to retain the archaic “an\nhistorical,” just as some preachers retain the obsolete\n“an holy” and “an house,” which they find\nin the Bible of 1611.</p>\n<p>—8th S. I, Jan. 16, '92:46</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I could go on, but space is limited.  If readers would\n(or would not) enjoy the inclusion of occasional extracts\nfrom such sources, many of which demonstrate\nthat the concerns of people interested in language\nmore than a century ago were often the same\nas those besetting us today, they should please let\nthe Editor know their wishes.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
