In other words he's what was called in 16th-century\nEngland a WAGHALTER 'one who is likely to swing\nfrom a halter; a gallows bird.'  This term of opprobrium was\nearly shortened to WAG and applied humorously to mischievous\nboys and habitual pranksters.  At least that's one theory\nadvanced to explain the meaning of the noun WAG 'a jester;\none full of sport and humor,' even though in the <em>OED</em> the\nearliest use of WAG 'a mischievous boy' (1553) antedates the\nearliest use of WAGHALTER (1570).  More commonly used is the\nverb WAG 'to move briskly and repeatedly from side to side'\n[from Middle English <em>waggen</em>; from the root of Old English\n<em>wagian</em> 'to move about; to totter, to sway'], as a friendly or\nexcited dog does his tail.  WAGGLE 'to move back and forth or\nup and down repeatedly' is labeled by the authorities a\n“frequentative” of WAG, thus meaning 'to wag frequently'\n(though it strikes me as being a diminutive meaning 'to wag a\nlittle').  A WAGTAIL is 'one of a genus of birds characterized by\nlong, constantly waggling tails.'</p>\n<p>The source of all these words is Indo-European *<em>wegh</em>- 'to\nmove, to set in motion; to go, to transport in a vehicle.'  The\nmore specialized sense of 'to transport in a vehicle' hints at the\nfact that WAG, WAGGLE, WAGHALTER, and WAGTAIL are all first\ncousins to English WAGON 'a four-wheeled vehicle' [from\nMiddle Dutch <em>wagen</em>], a vehicle in which things are transported.\nWagons range all the way from children's go-carts\nthrough the homely VOLKSWAGEN 'people's wagon' to that\nonce luxurious mode of travel, the WAGON-LIT (literally)\n'wagon-bed'; 'a continental European railway sleeping car'\n[French <em>lit</em> 'bed'].  The Old English words for four-wheeled\nvehicles were <em>wægen, wægen</em>, and <em>wæn</em>, predecessors of English\nWAIN 'a large horse-drawn farm wagon.'  The very similar\nDutch word <em>wagen</em> &gt; WAGON was first adopted as a military\nterm learned in the continental wars of the 16th century.\nRelated words are WAINWRIGHT 'a builder of wagons' and\nWAINSCOT (etymologically) 'planking for wagons'; 'wood paneling\napplied to the walls of rooms' [from Middle Dutch or\nMiddle Low German <em>wagenschot (schot</em> 'wooden partition')].\nHowever, the identity of this Middle Dutch or Middle Low\nGerman <em>wagen-</em> with <em>wagen</em> 'wagon' is doubted by some, who\nrefer it to Old Frisian <em>wāch</em> = Old English <em>wāg</em> 'wall.'</p>\n<p>A less easily recognized cognate of WAG 'to move to and\nfro' and WAGON 'a vehicle (for moving things)' is WEIGH\n(obsolete) 'to carry from one place to another'; 'to hoist; to\nraise a ship's anchor; to ascertain the heaviness (WEIGHT) of\nanything; to consider, to compare' [from Old English <em>wegan</em> 'to\nmove, to carry, to weigh'].  An Anglian (northern English)\nvariant of Old English <em>wæge</em> 'weight' was <em>wēg, wēge</em>, which\nbecame in northern Middle English <em>wei, we</em>, and was usually\nassociated with the word 'little' so that 'a little wee' meant 'a\nlittle weight,' also 'a little bit (of anything).'  Eventually the\nnoun <em>wee</em> 'weight' came to be used as an adjective meaning\n'very small': WEE 'tiny' (a WEE lad, a WEE drop, the WEE hours,\nthe WEE folk).</p>\n<p>The connection between WAGONING and WEIGHING is not\nhard to grasp, especially for a trucker, who would also appreci-\nate the connection of both of these words with yet another\ncognate, that is, WAY 'a passage, road, street, track or path'\n[from Old English <em>weg</em>].  (In Modern German we have <em>Weg</em>\n'way,' and <em>bewegen</em> 'to move.')  Additional cognates are AWAY\n(originally) 'on the way'; 'from this place, from that place; at a\nlittle distance; in a different direction' [from Old English <em>aweg,\nonweg</em>; from <em>on weg</em> 'on the way, on one's way (from)'];\nALWAYS 'in every way; at all times' [from Middle English <em>alle\nwei</em>, genitive <em>alles weis, alleweyes, alwayes</em>; from Old English\n<em>(e)alne weg</em> 'all way']; SIDEWAYS; LENGTHWAYS; WAYLAY 'to lie\nin waiting along the road; to ambush'; WAYFARER 'a traveler\nalong the road'; and WAYWARD = AWAYWARD 'straying from\nthe path.'  Yet another cognate is WIGGLE 'to squirm; to move\nback and forth quickly; to move slightly to and fro,' described\nby some linguists as a “thinning” of WAGGLE, and certainly\ncuter.</p>\n<p>The Latin word for 'way' is <em>via</em> 'way, road, street, route,\nhighway; march, journey.'  According to some etymologists, <em>via</em>\ntraces back to Indo-European *<em>wegh</em>- 'to move; to go' by way\nof Old Latin <em>veha</em> and Indo-European <em><em>wegh-ya</em>-.  Others,\nhowever, link Latin <em>via</em> to Indo-European <em><em>wei</em>- 'to go after\nsomething' or associate it with Latin <em>vis, vim</em> 'force.'  In\nEnglish, the Latin word <em>via</em> is used to mean 'by way of,' but\n<em>via</em> shows up in other English loanwords, like VIADUCT 'a\nbridge carrying a road over a valley or other low-lying area'\n[from Latin <em>via</em> 'road' + <em>ductus</em> 'a leading'] (by analogy with\n<em>aqueduct</em>, from Latin <em>aquaeductus</em> 'an elevated structure for\nsupporting a water conduit over low-lying ground') and VIATICUM\n'supplies for a journey; an allowance for traveling\nexpenses; the Eucharist given to a person in danger of death'\n[from Latin <em>viāticum</em> 'money for a journey; a soldier's savings';\nfrom <em>viāticus</em> 'of a journey' (<em>via</em> 'way' + -</em>āticus</em> 'pertaining\nto')].  Late Latin <em>viāticum</em> evolved into Old French <em>veiag,\nveage, viage, voiage</em>, whence Anglo-French, whence Middle\nEnglish <em>veiage, viage, voiage</em>, whence Modern English (and\nFrench) VOYAGE 'a long journey to a distant land; a journey\nacross the open sea.'  Thus, what started out as a road, then\npreparations for taking to the road, now applies to trips across\nthe trackless ocean, or into outer space (and what started out as\na day's trip, that is, a <em>journey</em> &lt; <em>journée</em> 'a day's traveling'\nstretches out into years, and what started out as a step, that is,\na <em>trip</em> 'to step lightly' becomes a journey).</p>\n<p>The element <em>via</em> 'road' appears in many compound English\nwords, for example DEVIATE 'to turn aside from the path,\nto stray off the road; to digress' [from Late Latin <em>dēviāre,\ndēviātus</em> 'to go off the road'].  Late Latin <em>dēviāre</em> is based on\nthe Latin adjective <em>devius</em> 'out of the way; off the road,' which\nis also the ancestor of English DEVIOUS 'roundabout, circuitous;\nnot straightforward, underhanded' and OBVIATE 'to remove\nfrom the way; to make unnecessary by anticipating or circumventing'\n[from Late Latin <em>obviāre, obviātus</em> 'to meet, to\nencounter,' hence 'to prevent' (<em>ob</em> 'against, facing' + <em>via</em> '(in)\nthe way')].  Here again the Late Latin verb is based on an\nearlier Latin adjective, this one <em>obvius</em> (&lt; <em>obviam</em>) '(standing)\nin the way,' forerunner of English OBVIOUS (archaic) 'standing\nin the way'; 'easily perceived.'</p>\n<p>In Latin a place where three roads meet is called a\n<em>trivium</em>.  One might expect the related adjective <em>triviālis</em> to\nhave something to do with forks in the road, but instead Latin\n<em>triviālis</em> means 'commonplace, ordinary; what can be met with\nanywhere, at any crossroads.'  <em>Triviālis</em> has been borrowed into\nEnglish as TRIVIAL 'ordinary, commonplace; of little importance.'\nThe plural noun TRIVIA 'insignificant matters, trifles' is a\nrecent coinage, although in Roman antiquity <em>trivia</em> meant 'a\ncrossroads,' and capitalized, 'Diana as the three-faced goddess,\nHecate.'  Essentially a back formation from TRIVIAL, Modern\nEnglish TRIVIA is not listed in the <em>OED</em> nor the <em>OED Supplement</em>\nof 1933, but it is in <em>MW2</em>, published 1934.  In the Middle\nAges a new meaning was assigned to the Latin word TRIVIUM\n'the three liberal arts of grammar, rhetoric, and logic forming\nthe elementary division of the seven liberal arts in medieval\nschools and required of all who would obtain a bachelor's\ndegree.'  The other four liberal arts were arithmetic, geometry,\nastronomy, and music.  Together these were known as the\nQUADRIVIUM, which in Latin means 'crosswords; place where\nfour roads meet.'  According to Henry Hallam's <em>Introduction to\nthe Literature of Europe</em>, the TRIVIUM and QUADRIVIUM were\nintroduced into the halls of learning in the 6th century.</p>\n<p>To go along with DEVIOUS and OBVIOUS we have PREVIOUS\n'having gone that way before; existing or occurring before\nsomething else' [from Latin <em>praevius</em> 'going before, leading the\nway' (<em>prae</em> 'before')] and PERVIOUS 'open to passage, allowing\npassage through' [from Latin <em>pervius</em> 'passable, unobstructed'\n(<em>per</em> 'through')].  The last word is more often encountered in the\nnegative IMPERVIOUS 'incapable of being penetrated.'</p>\n<p>As already seen in the development of the word VOYAGE,\nLatin <em>via</em> 'way' changed to French <em>voy</em>-, or more correctly, to\nFrench <em>voie</em> 'way.'  Similarly, Late Latin <em>inviāre</em> 'to send on a\njourney' became Old French <em>envoier</em> 'to send,' and has resulted\nin the two English words ENVOY 'a messenger sent on a\nmission; an emissary' and INVOICE 'a detailed list of goods\nshipped.'  INVOICE is a variant spelling of the plural of French\n<em>envoi</em> 'parcel, package; goods forwarded,' i.e., <em>invois</em>, construed\nas a singular and respelled with -<em>ce</em> to conform with English\nusage.  Also used in English literature is French ENVOI 'a short\nconcluding stanza of certain verse forms; a parting word.'</p>\n<p>Similar words are CONVOY 'to accompany on the way; to\nescort' [from Old French <em>conveier, conveier</em>, from Vulgar Latin\n*<em>conviāre</em> (<em>con</em> &lt; <em>cum</em> 'together with')] and CONVEY 'to carry\nfrom one place to another; to communicate, to make known'\n[from Old French <em>conveier, convoier</em> and Vulgar Latin\n*<em>conviāre</em>].</p>\n<p>The Classical Latin verb descended from Indo-European\n*<em>weigh</em>- 'to move, to transport in a vehicle' is <em>vehere, vectus</em> 'to\ncarry, to transport.'  The most obvious English borrowing is\nVEHICLE 'any device for carrying passengers or goods; a\nmedium of expression' [via French <em>véhicule</em> from Latin\n<em>vehiculum</em> 'conveyance'].  The Latin suffix -<em>iculum</em>, whence\nEnglish -<em>icle</em>, usually indicates a diminutive, as in <em>particle</em> 'a\nlittle part,' <em>auricle</em> 'a little ear,' <em>versicle</em> 'a little verse,' and\n<em>article</em> 'a little joint, division,' but in this case it seems to be\nused as an instrumental suffix meaning 'means of (carrying).'</p>\n<p>A word that is listed in some English dictionaries as\nforeign and not listed at all in others (although well known to\nmembers of the American Legion, especially the Forty-and-Eight\nDivision), is French VOITURE 'a carriage; a railway\ncoach; a railway car' [from Latin <em>vectūra</em> 'carrying; conveyance'].\nIn the American Legion, a VOITURE is 'a local constituent\nunit of the Forty-and-Eight Division' (<em>MW3</em>), who took\ntheir name from the French railroad cars that were marked\nduring World War I as capable of transporting forty men or\n(sardonically “and”) eight horses 'voiture à quarante hommes\nou huit chevaux.'</p>\n<p>Latin <em>vehere, vectus</em> has many compounds, but only one\nthat has been adopted into English as a verb, that is, INVEIGH\n(etymologically) 'to carry into; to sail into'; 'to assail with\nwords; to give vent to a denunciation' [from Latin <em>invehere,\ninvectus</em> 'to carry into,' passive <em>invehī</em> 'to burst into; to attack'].\nThe past participle <em>invectus</em> yields Late Latin <em>invectīvus</em>\n'vituperative' and Medieval Latin <em>invectīva</em> (<em>ōrātiō</em>) 'abusive\n(speech),' whence English INVECTIVE 'an abusive expression; a\nvehement denunciation.'</p>\n<p>Speaking of <em>vehement</em> and VEHEMENCE 'forcefulness of\nexpression; great or excessive ardor' [from Latin <em>vehemēns</em> =\n<em>vēmēns</em> 'violent, furious; forcible'], some etymologists suggest\nthe possibility that these words may also derive from Latin\n<em>vehere</em> 'to carry, to transport.'  (One speaks of an incensed\nperson as being “transported” with rage.)  The suffix -<em>ment</em> (&lt;\nLatin -<em>mentum</em>) is used to express the result of an action\n(<em>fragment</em> 'what is left after something is broken') or the\ninstrument of an action (<em>ornament</em> 'that which embellishes').  If\n<em>vehemence</em> stems from <em>vehere</em> that would make it either 'the\nproduct of being transported' or more likely 'the instrument of\nattacking' (<em>invehī</em> 'to attack').  However, other etymologists\nbelieve that the <em>vehe</em>- of Latin <em>vēhemēns</em> = <em>vēmēns</em> is derived\nfrom Latin <em>vē</em>- 'lacking,' so that the etymological meaning\nwould be 'lacking in or deprived of mind' (<em>mēns</em> 'mind').</p>\n<p>Another English word based on the Latin past participle\n<em>vectus</em> 'carried, transported' is CONVECTION 'the process of\ntransmitting or conveying' [from Late Latin <em>convectiō</em>, from\nLatin <em>convehere</em> 'to carry together'].  CONVECTION is mostly\nrestricted to scientific meanings in physics and meterology\n(the fact that hot air rises is an example of <em>thermal convection</em>\n'the transmitting of heat by motion of the hot materials').  In\nLatin, <em>convector</em> means 'fellow passenger.'</p>\n<p>A related term is Latin <em>convexus</em> 'valuted, arched.'  This is\napparently an old past participle of <em>convehere, convectus</em> 'to\ncarry together,' and the meaning arises because in forming an\narch the extremities of the surface are “drawn together to a\npoint” (<em>ODEE</em>).  The English loanword from <em>convexus</em> is CONVEX\n'curved like the outside of a circle or arch.'</p>\n<p>Other English borrowings from the past participle <em>vectus</em>\nare more abstruse; for example VECTOR (biology) 'an organism\nthat carries pathogens from one host to another'; (mathematics)\n'a quantity specified by a magnitude and a direction' [from\nLatin <em>vector</em> 'bearer, carrier']; ADVECTION 'a local change in a\nproperty of a system'; and EVECTION 'solar perturbation of the\nlunar orbit' [from Latin <em>ēvectiō</em> 'a carrying out; a raising up'].\n(A defaulting tenant's furniture is “carried out” when he is evicted, but this is a different word, from Latin evincere,\n<em>evicted</em>, but this is a different word, from Latin <em>ēvincere,\nēvictus</em> 'to conquer completely.')  Note, also, PROVECTION 'the\ncarrying forward of the final sound of a word to a following\nword.'  Examples of provection are <em>a nickname</em> &lt; <em>an ekename</em>\n('an additional name'); <em>a newt</em> &lt; <em>an ewt; the nonce</em> &lt; <em>then\nones; Nash</em> &lt; <em>an ash, Powell</em> &lt; <em>ap Howell</em>; and <em>Price</em> &lt; <em>ap\nRhys</em>.  This linguistic phenomenon also takes place in the\nopposite direction.  Examples are <em>an umpire</em> &lt; <em>a nompere; an\nadder</em> &lt; <em>a nadder; an apron</em> &lt; <em>a napron</em> (compare <em>napery</em>);\nand <em>an orange</em> &lt; <em>a narancia</em> (compare Spanish <em>naranja</em>).\nTRANSVECTION, labeled rare in most modern dictionaries,\nrefers to the 'transportation through the air of a witch by a\ndevil,' fortunately a relatively uncommon occurrence these\ndays.</p>\n<p>The Latin verb <em>vexāre</em> 'to agitate; to torment, to harass' is\nalso thought to be related to Latin <em>vehere, vectus</em>, probably by\nway of the past participle.  Since <em>vehere, vectus</em> 'to carry'\nimplies transportation, and transportation in Roman days was\nby horseback, in springless vehicles, or on a boat or ship, one\ncan see how the 'to agitate' meaning of <em>vexāre</em> arose, and the\nextended meanings of 'to torment, to harass.'  (Compare the\nsemantic progression of Vulgar Latin <em>tripāliāre</em> 'to torture' &gt;\nOld French <em>travailler</em> 'to travail' &gt; English <em>travel</em>.)  Obvious\nEnglish borrowings from Latin <em>vexāre</em> 'to harass' are VEX 'to\nirritate, to annoy' and its derivatives VEXATIONS and VEXATIOUS.</p>\n<p>Returning to Germanic derivatives of Indo-European\n*<em>wegh</em>- 'to move, to set in motion; to go, to transport in a\nvehicle' that have come down to English, we are buoyed up by\nthe English noun WAVE 'a swell moving along the surface of a\nbody of water; oscillations' [from Middle English <em>wawe,\nwaghe</em>; from Old English <em>wæg</em> 'motion, wave'].  This is the\nderivation given by some, but others trace the noun WAVE to\nthe same source as the verb to <em>wave</em>, which comes from Indo-European\n*<em>webh</em>- 'to weave.'  What seems to have happened is\nthat as the two forms approached each other phonetically, the\none for 'moving the hand back and forth as a signal' (from\n*<em>webh</em>- 'to weave') superseded the Middle English <em>waw</em> 'a\nmoving swell of water' (from *<em>wegh</em>- 'to move, to go').  Note,\nalso, VOGUE 'the prevailing fashion' [from French <em>vogue</em> 'rowing,\nsailing, going,' <em>voguer</em> 'to row (a boat)'].  This elegant word\nhad a slangy origin, that is, to be in VOGUE was something like\n'to be in the rowing, sailing, going.'  (Compare <em>to be in the\nswim</em>.)  French <em>voguer</em> 'to row' has Italian, Portuguese, and\nSpanish counterparts, respectively <em>vogare, vogar</em>, and <em>bogar</em> 'to\nrow.'  They all presumably come from a Germanic source\nrelated to Middle High German <em>wogen</em> 'to float, to be borne by\nthe waves' and descended from Indo-European *<em>wegh</em>- 'to set\nin motion.'  Another derivative of Indo-European *<em>wegh</em>- is\nEARWIG 'an insect once thought to be able to penetrate a\nperson's head through the ear,' a creature known in German as\n<em>Ohrwurm</em> 'earworm.'  The -WIG of EARWIG comes from Old\nEnglish <em>wicga</em> 'earwig; “thing that moves quickly” (<em>AHD</em>),\nrelated to WIGGLE (although some authorities tie the element -\n<em>wig</em> to <em>vetch</em>, which would make it a descendant of Indo-European\n*<em>wei</em>- 'to turn' or *<em>weik</em>- 'to bend').  Still other\nderivatives of Indo-European *<em>wegh</em>- are NORWAY 'northern\nway; northern region' [from Old Norse <em>Norvegr</em>] (the Modern\nNorwegian word is <em>Norge</em>); GRAYWACKE 'a kind of dark gray\nsandstone' [from German <em>Grauwacke</em>, from <em>grau</em> 'gray' +\n<em>Wacke</em> a German miners' word adopted as a geological term;\nfrom Old High German <em>wacko, waggo</em> ' “boulder rolling on a\nriver bed” (<em>AHD</em>)]; and WALL-EYED 'having a light-colored,\nwhitish eye or eyes; having one eye that turns out with a\ndivergent squint; having bulging eyes' [from Middle English\n<em>wawileghed</em>, from Old Norse <em>vagleygr</em>].  The <em>wall</em>- element is\nthus traced to Old Norse <em>vagl</em> 'wooden beam, roost, perch.'\n<em>Vagl</em> also survives in Icelandic <em>vagl</em> 'a film over the eyes' and in\nSwedish <em>vagel</em> 'a sty in the eye.'  However; the connection with\n'to set in motion' is not exactly obvious.  <em>MW3</em> has Old Norse\n<em>vagl</em> 'beam, roost; beam in the eye' akin to Old Norse <em>vega</em> 'to\nmove, to carry, to lift,' so the semantic connection may be by\nway of the notion of 'carrying.'</p>\n<p>English <em>wall</em>- &lt; Middle English <em>wawil</em>- &lt; Old Norse\n<em>vagl-trace</em> further back to Germanic *<em>waglaz</em>, and thence to a\n“suffixed <em>o</em>-grade form (of Indo-European *<em>wegh</em>-) *<em>wogh-lo</em>-”\n(<em>AHD</em>).  From this same *<em>wegh-lo</em>- comes Greek <em>okhlos</em> 'disturbance,\ntrouble; populace, mob; moving mass.'  Note that Greek\ndrops the initial digamma, or <em>w</em>-.  <em>Okhlos</em> 'mob' gives us the\nEnglish terms OCHLOCRACY 'mob rule' and OCHLOPHOBIA\n'morbid fear of crowds; fear of mobs.'</p>\n<h1></h1>",
