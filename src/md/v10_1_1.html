<p>The English-speaking nations may believe themselves to be
divided by their common language, but their plight
doesn't even approach that of the Spanish-speaking peoples.
The visiting American who says <em>bum</em> inopportunely or the
Englishman who urges Americans to <em>Keep their peckers up</em> may
perhaps suffer mild embarrassment, but neither of them will
experience the show-stopping thrill induced by a Cuban lady
who gratefully acknowledges to the Buenos Aires civic organization,
“Yes, your welcoming committee fucked me right in the
door of the airplane.”</p>
<p>Unless coached beforehand, any visitor from a northern
country of Latin America is likely to have at least one
experience like that before he learns that in the Rio de la Plata
area the elsewhere perfectly decent verb <em>coger</em> 'to pick up,
grasp, catch, gather' is taboo.  In those southern lands, <em>coger</em>,
which is the verb our Cuban lady used, has come to have only
one meaning, an obscene one, and the verb has therefore been
lost to the <em>rioplatenses</em> for civil discourse.  A comparable
situation might be for English to lose the use of the word <em>get</em>
because overemphasis on its minor generative meaning has
shouldered out all other uses.  It is difficult to imagine the ends
we would have to go to to avoid the use of the lost word, but it
is exactly that kind of a struggle that occurs every time
somebody in gaucho country has to express precisely what
<em>coger</em> would say if he could use it.</p>
<p>The northerners rail at this silliness, but in doing so they
forget the beam in their own eye.  The people of many of the
northern countries have inflicted on the verb <em>tirar</em> 'throw, pull,
stretch, discard, shoot, publish, etc.' the same fate that <em>coger</em>
has suffered around the Rio de la Plata.  In fact, when you
compare the space taken up in dictionaries, you are led to
conclude that <em>tirar</em> is an even greater loss to the language than
<em>coger</em>.</p>
<p>How is a traveler to know these things?  Having lived in
several Latin American countries and Spain and having traveled
in every one of them, I have suffered a few linguistic
bruises myself, and I conclude that no ordinary mortal can
foresee all the possibilities for embarrassment, especially since
most of the bothersome differences seem to be in the areas of
food and sex, neither of which boons one wishes to forswear.
One must eat.  But no matter how fluent one's Spanish, one
may find eating in restaurants an unexpected struggle during
the first few days in a new Hispanic country.  It might surprise
many Americans to know that, even without much knowledge
of Spanish, they would understand a typical Mexican restaurant
menu more readily than a Chilean would, because in Chile
a <em>taco</em> is the 'heel of a shoe or a billiard cue,' and the Chilean
never heard of <em>enchiladas, frijoles</em>, or <em>tamales</em>.  [The American
should not be complacent, however.  He or she may recognize
the word <em>tamales</em> on the menu, but if only one is wanted, the
customer must ask for a <em>tamal</em>, not a <em>tamale</em>.]  Our Chilean
visitor may see <em>tomates</em> on the menu and of course knows what
<em>they</em> are, but he or she may be in for a surprise, because it will
be green.  If you want a ripe tomato in Mexico, you must order
a <em>jitomate</em>.  If the Chilean complains, the Mexican might
justifiably claim a sort of proprietorship over the words, whose
structure implies their origin in the ancient world of the
northern part of what is now Hispanic America, along with
<em>aguacate, elote, ayote, pataste, zapote</em>, and <em>peyote</em>, to name but
a few, which are, respectively, an 'avocado,' an 'ear of corn,' a
'squash,' 'another variety of squash,' a 'fruit,' and a 'high.'</p>
<p>It is true that an American in England might stumble over
<em>treacle</em> or <em>corn</em> and might not have the faintest idea what a
<em>Cornish pastie</em> is, but he or she would at least recognize the
ingredients of the pastie if a Briton named them.  In contrast, if
a Uruguayan tried to describe to a Mexican the ingredients of
the beloved boiled dinner, the <em>puchero</em>, the Mexican would not
understand the words for <em>corn on the cob, sweet potato, beans</em>,
and <em>beef ribs</em>.</p>
<p>As far as I know, English speakers everywhere generally
agree on the words for <em>potato, tomato, bacon, sweet potato,
butter, lard, chops, grapefruit, strawberry, peach, banana,
pineapple, avocado, beans</em>, and <em>green pepper</em>.  (<em>Sweet potatoes</em>
are also called <em>yams</em>, of course, but most English speakers are
familiar with both names.)  Hispanics are not unanimous about
any of the words for those foods nor about many others too
numerous to list here, and as a general rule you will not be
understood if you use the wrong variant for your current
location.  As is the case with <em>tomate</em> and <em>jitomate</em> between Chile
and Mexico, so it is among the various nations with regard to
'potato' <em>patata, papa</em>; 'bacon' <em>tocino, panceta</em>; 'sweet potato'
<em>batata, boniato, moniato</em>; 'butter' <em>manteca, mantequilla</em>; 'lard'
<em>manteca, grasa de cerdo</em>; 'chop' <em>costilla, chuleta</em>; 'grapefruit'
<em>toronja, pomelo</em>; 'strawberry' <em>fresa, frutilla</em>; 'peach' <em>durazno,
melocotón</em>; 'banana' <em>plátano, banana, guineo, mínimo</em>; 'pineapple'
<em>piña, ananá</em>; 'avocado' <em>aguacate, palta</em>; 'green bean'
<em>habichuela verde, judía, chaucha, haba</em>; 'beans' <em>habichuelas,
frijoles, porotos</em>; 'sweet pepper' <em>ají, chili para relleno, pimienta</em>;
'corn on the cob' <em>elote, choclo</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the struggle for comprehension involves both
food and sex in the same word.  In many countries of Latin
America, <em>cajeta</em>, a creamy caramel spread, made from milk and
sugar, is used on pancakes or toast or as an icing or filling for
cakes, candies, and cookies; but woe to the sweet-toothed
Mexican who asks a waitress in Montevideo if she has <em>cajeta</em>.
She will not know he means <em>dulce de leche</em>: she will understand
him to be asking her if she has a cunt.  On the other hand, if
the Mexican slips and says <em>chingada</em>, which might burn the
ears of a Mexican waitress, the Uruguayan will not bat an eye,
because she will not know the word at all.  Many Americans
whose Spanish is a rudimentary Tex-Mex assume that ¡<em>chingada!</em>
and its bowdlerized form ¡<em>chihuahua!</em> are universal
expletives among Hispanic peoples, but it is not so.  Even where
a certain sexual allusion is common throughout the Hispanic
world, the words that express it may not be the same for all
regions.  Spanish speakers everywhere cite testicles both to label
a man a hero and to call him an idiot.  To say that a man has
<em>pelotas</em> or <em>bolas</em> 'balls' or <em>huevos</em> 'eggs' is to qualify him as a
brave and most admirable he-man.  [I never use the word
<em>macho</em> any more, because the English-speaking world has
adopted it and ruined its noble connotations.]  But if a man is
<em>pelotudo</em> or <em>boludo</em> or <em>huevón</em>, it means he has outsized
testicles, i.e., he is stupid or subhuman.</p>
<p>Every region of the Hispanic world has its own collection
of words for human genitalia, and sometimes these words are
transferable to other regions, but more often they are not.  In
Buenos Aires, for example, the penis is known variously as <em>la
pija, la pistola, la poronga, el nabo</em> 'turnip,' or <em>el mongo</em>.  [Those
who assert that language can be sexist may note with perplexity
that the most commonly used words for penis, testicles, and
beard, attributes which characterize men as men, are of
feminine gender in Spanish, whereas the words for a woman's
breasts, except for the indelicate <em>tetas</em>, are masculine (<em>senos,
pechos</em>.)]  One can imagine the impact on the public of Buenos
Aires the day a careless or mischievous typesetter set up a
headline chronicling the doings of the famous General Slim,
known east of Suez as <em>Monghi Slim</em>.  The headline stood out
blatantly on the newsstands, and even those who spoke no
English could understand from the words MONGO SLIM
VICTORIOUS that he had won and what somebody thought
of him.</p>
<p>I have heard fewer names for female genitalia, and that
may be because the shape offers fewer opportunities for similes
than the male organs.  As noted, <em>cajeta</em> is used in one region.
Although in some other countries it means 'caramel syrup,' its
original Spanish meaning is a 'small box,' and the sexual
application is obvious.  <em>Concha</em> means 'shell' and is also apt.
<em>Vaina</em>, a descendant of <em>vagina</em>, is perfectly acceptable in most
Hispanic countries and means exactly what its Latin root
meant, 'sheath.'  Like <em>vagina</em> everywhere in the modern world,
<em>vaina</em> in Colombia has come to be used for one human organ;
but whereas <em>vagina</em> is clinical and acceptable in most circumstances,
<em>vaina</em> is obscene in Colombia.  Anyone who has spent
time there can testify that Colombian males use the word with
the same emphasis, intent, and effect as English-speaking males
of all nations use the word <em>fuck</em> in locker rooms and barracks.</p>
<p>Some years ago the State Department assigned a friend of
mine, who is fluent in Spanish, to a tour of duty in Bogotá, a
city he did not know.  He was accompanied by his wife, Vina.
Now, when one uses the word <em>señora</em> as an adjective in
Spanish, it can have the meaning 'magnificent, grandiose'âas in
¡<em>Es una señora casa!</em>  'It is a tremendous house!'  For many days,
my friend's new Colombian friends were either too embarrassed
or too mischievous to tell him that he was introducing
his wife (“Señora Vina”) to Colombian society as “my magnificent
cunt.”</p>
<p>Anyone who has tried to enter into a foreign language in
another land has experienced or heard about those moments
when the innocent use of a word suddenly submerges the
speaker in a shocked silence.</p>
<p>It happened to me.  A group of close friends took me
partridge hunting in Uruguay, and I had an excellent day.  My
friends argued good-naturedly among themselves and with me
about whether this <em>yanqui</em> was really that much of a crack shot
or whether it was all <em>puro ojete.  Ojete</em> means 'eyelet,' but it was
obvious from the context that they were saying I was unbelievably
lucky.  <em>Pues bien,</em> at a cocktail party in Montevideo a few
days later, I was holding forth to a mixed group of Uruguayans
on the marvels of their country's game birds, and this kind of
praise invariably garners a sizeable and attentive audience.
After announcing the number of birds I had bagged, I
modestly admitted in a clear and ringing voice that it had been
nothing but <em>puro ojete</em>.</p>
<p>Reflexively, a friend standing nearby said, “What did you
say?”</p>
<p>And so, I said it again.</p>
<p>By now, the glassy eyes around me told me something was
wrong.  Later, I learned that in Uruguay, <em>ojete</em> means only one
thing â'asshole.'  In defense of my hunting companions, they
had not tried to play a trick on me.  They assumed that I knew
what the word meant, just as they assumed that I knew that
the most vivid way to call a man phenomenally lucky is to say
that he has a huge asshole.</p>
<p>Uruguay was also the scene of a slip that I think must
stand as an all-time classic.  A young woman from a northern
country (Ecuador, I think) was visiting a posh country club
near Montevideo.  She was of that green-eyed, blonde Spanish
type one sees so frequently and with such pleasure on the
streets of Madrid, and her face was matched in beauty by a
superb body.  The bikini had not yet shrunk to the string size of
today's models, but she was nonetheless giving the males
around the club pool a pleasant afternoon contemplating the
contents of a provocative bathing suit.  Needless to say, a large
number of young males had gathered to enjoy the spectacle.</p>
<p>In the midst of the almost palpable lust, she eased herself
gingerly into the water.  She wasn't serious about swimming; it
was simply a continuation of the show.  After paddling about
daintily and seductively for two or three minutes, she got out
and stood dripping divinely at the edge of the pool.  But when
she took off her bathing cap and fluffed her golden tresses, she
discovered that they were damp.  Whereupon she exclaimed,
<em>“¡Ay, mira mi cabello!  ¡Y apenas me mojé la concha!”</em></p>
<p>In her native region, <em>concha</em> means 'skin,' and so she was
not saying anything extraordinary from her point of view.  But
to the dumfounded Uruguayans, she had exclaimed, “Darn it,
look at my hair!  And I just barely got my cunt wet!”</p>
<p>I wonder if she still blushes when she remembers, as I still
feel embarrassed about having proclaimed the size of my
asshole at an Uruguayan cocktail party.  She and I belong to an
exclusive club from which any normal person would, in fact,
wish fervently to be excluded.  If I had any way to get in touch
with her, I'd tell her it helps to write about it.  Or, if she prefers
not to do that, then my advice, in her own dialect, would be to
relax and try to maintain a thick <em>concha</em>.</p>
