(Future editions will, of course,\ncontain more.)</p>\n<p>“The authors say that if they came across reliable\ninformation about rarer names, they wrote entries.\nIn other words, if someone else had done the\nresearch in what appeared to be a scholarly way,\nthey took advantage of it.”  One should not think\nthat the book is a scissors-and-paste job.  The compilers\nwrite, “...the number of reliable reference\nworks [on family names] is remarkably small” (p.\nxlvii).  After mentioning these few, they conclude,\n“At this point the list of honourable exceptions begins\nto run out” (p. xlviii).  Therefore, to compensate\nfor the scarcity of reliable secondary literature,\nthe compilers turned to many specialists.  From the\nfive pages of personal acknowledgments (as opposed\nto a mere two pages of bibliography), it should be\nclear that the dictionary rests largely on original research.\nAs “special consultant” for the Jewish\nnames, I can say that all of my explanations are original\nwith me.  (How the Jewish names were treated is\ndescribed in “The Jewish Family Names in the Oxford\n<em>Dictionary of Surnames</em>,” <em>Jewish Language Review</em>\n7, 1987, pp. 139-46.)</p>\n<p>Mr. Dunkling has “doubts about how ordinary\nusers of this dictionary will cope with its metalanguage,”\nciting lines which contain several abbreviations\nand technical terms.  With forty-one pages of\nIntroduction and two pages devoted to the resolution\nof abbreviations, the task is not as hard as he\nmakes it out to be.</p>\n<p>He writes, “genealogical information is occasionally\nadded..., but only when the families concerned\nare 'important' according to a very traditional\ndefinition of that word.”  Yes, and that is\nbecause genealogical information is most abundant\nfor such people: what, for instance, is known about\nthe ancestry of Frankie Vaughan?  Also, if anyone\ninfers from later remarks in Mr. Dunkling's review\n(about “the 'noble' theme”) that only “noble” families\nare the subject of genealogical notes, that assumption\nwould be wrong: there are genealogical\nvignettes for George Washington, John Adams,\nAbraham Lincoln, the Roosevelts, and many other\n“commoners.”</p>\n<p>What I missed in Mr. Dunkling's remarks is\nmention of a major innovation in this dictionary:\nnesting.  The family names are not listed as in a telephone\ndirectory, merely in alphabetical order, with\nno articulation between one entry and the next:\nrather, if names are etymologically related to one\nanother, they are all listed under the same entry.\nFor example, over 285 names appear under <em>George</em>.\nMoreover, within each entry the names are broken\ndown according to form and structure—for example,\nvariants, cognates, diminutives, augmentatives,\npatronymics, and patronymics from diminutives—\nwith further classification (according to language)\nand comment.  A 230-page alphabetical index guides\nthe user to the location of the names.  <em>A Dictionary\nof Surnames</em> is thus more like a thesaurus than an\nalphabetical dictionary.</p>\n<p><em>[David L.
