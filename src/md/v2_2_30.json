Shapiro}</h1>\n<p>A few remarks about three eye-catching items in the\nmost recent number of VERBATIM (I, 4).</p>\n<p>Concerning Donald A. Sears' article “Ameritalian,” I\nwould certainly not contest his thesis that English (or\nAnglo-American) is spreading its tentacles the length and\nbreadth of The Boot, and especially in Tuscany.  But he\nmay be going overboard a little in insisting that it is doing\nso at the expense of French, when, ironically, French itself\nmay be partially to blame.  (One of his examples, by the\nway—<em>frigo</em>—is probably not from the English at all; though\nif it is, it may, conceivably, be a direct borrowing of the\nFrench <em>frigo</em>, short for <em>frigorifique</em>.  More likely, however,\nit is just a native abbreviation of the perfectly good Italian\nnoun <em>frigorifero</em>.)  French influence may be largely responsible\nfor spreading, if not necessarily introducing, such\nAnglo-Americanisms as <em>club, leader, standard, sexy, cocktail,\nrelax, pullover</em>, etc., all with greater or lesser histories\nas chic Franglais.  Even <em>after-shave</em> and <em>déodorant</em> are preferred\nby many an up-to-date Frenchman to the native\n<em>aprés-rasage</em> and <em>désodorisant</em>.  So, too, the profusion of\n<em>-ing</em> nouns (<em>touring, dancing, camping</em>, et al.), all of which\nenjoy special prestige in modern French.  The French are\nso addicted to this feature of English grammar, in fact,\nthat they have even invented a few <em>-ing</em> nouns of their\nown (e.g., <em>le footing</em> 'hiking'), and have modified others\ninto curious existence (e.g., <em>le living</em> 'livingroom,' <em>le shampooing</em>\n'shampoo').  French could be as responsible as English\nfor introducing <em>lo stereo</em> into Italian—N.B. the definite\narticle: <em>lo</em>, not <em>il</em>, at least not in Tuscany!—though\nthere's really no reason to attribute it to any external\nsource at all.  <em>Stereo-</em> is not an uncommon prefix in technical\nItalian.  As for <em>WC</em> versus <em>toilette</em>, the former Briticism\nis, and has long been, a favorite euphemism in\nFrench, pronounced in a variety of ways (thanks to the\nambiguity of the letter <em>w</em>), ranging from the concise <em>vécé</em>\nto the more elegant <em>ouatére-closette</em>.  By now, in fact, it is\nalmost pan-European.</p>\n<p>In short, while Anglo-American is indisputably leaving\nits mark on modern Italian, let's not forget to credit (or\ncondemn) French for at least a share in the process.</p>\n<p>The second item that caught my eye was the delightful\nfolk etymology suggested by Graham S. Mitchell, attributing\n<em>ballbuster</em> to the Yiddish <em>baleboosteh</em>.  It certainly\nwouldn't be the only Yiddish contribution to the American\nlanguage, as any schlemiel familiar with <em>Mencken</em> and\nothers will attest.  But a few opposing arguments do present\nthemselves.  First of all, a <em>ballbuster</em> isn't necessarily\na woman (Freud notwithstanding), or even, necessarily,\na human being.  Nor need it originally have been so.  Went-worth\nand Flexner (<em>Dictionary of American Slang</em>, T.Y.\nCrowell, 1967) list the nonpersonal meaning first ('A job,\ntask, activity, or goal that is extremely difficult to accomplish'),\nand derive the personal meaning from it ('The\nperson who assigns, demands, or supervises such arduous\ntasks').  I've often heard my students apply the term to an\nexam, for instance, or to any crushing problem of the moment.\nFurthermore, the syntactic variant to <em>bust my</em> (<em>his,\nyour</em>, etc.) <em>balls</em> is particularly common, and implies no\nfemale agency: e.g., <em>I had to bust my balls to get a C\nminus!</em>  (I'm not sure what the co-eds say—even the most\nliberated, verbally and otherwise.)  Of course, this doesn't\nhave to invalidate the <em>baleboosteh</em> hypothesis ipso facto—\nit's a case of chicken versus egg—but it casts at least a\nshadow of doubt.  More telling, perhaps, is the fact that the\nexpression in question, like the figurative phenomenon it\ndenotes, is hardly restricted to English.  More or less exact\nequivalents are found in the slang of many other languages,\nold and new.  Didn't Catullus call Lesbia an <em>ilia\nrumpens</em> (XI, 20)?  (Literally, a 'groin-buster,' but the implication\nis clear.)  French has its <em>casse-couilles</em>; Italian, its\n<em>rompecoglioni</em>; Spanish, its <em>rompebolas, rompehuevos</em> (and\nprobably several more, depending on the regional variety\ntypical of the Hispanic world); German, its <em>Hodenbrecher</em>\n(more “elegant” than the soldier-slang <em>Eierschleifer</em>);\nDutch, its <em>ballenbreker</em>; Hebrew, its <em>shovair beitzim</em>; Modern\nGreek, its <em>spastarchidis</em>.  And it wouldn't surprise me\nin the least to hear <em>pilkrompanto</em> on the lips of an outraged\nEsperantist.</p>\n<p>But what tends to discredit the hypothesis the most, I\nthink, is the fact that <em>baleboosteh</em>, in Yiddish, is almost\nexclusively a laudatory term.  A <em>baleboosteh</em>, to echo Mr.\nMitchell's closing words, “just gets things done, like any\ngood manager.”  Even more, though, she is generally admired\nfor this talent.  To quote Leo Rosten in <em>The Joys of\nYiddish</em> (McGraw-Hill, 1968): “To call a woman 'a real\n<em>baleboosteh</em>' is to bestow high praise indeed: It means the\nhonoree is a splendid cook, baker, laundress, and, above\nall, keeps so immaculate a home that 'you can eat off the\nfloor...' ” (p. 30).  Which is not to deny the possible\nconnotation of 'a bossy woman,' which Rosten himself\nadmits (although relegating it to the last of eight shades\nof meaning).  Uriel Weinreich, on the other hand, in his\nauthoritative <em>English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary</em>\n(McGraw-Hill, 1968), gives no pejorative meaning whatever.</p>\n<p>In any event, no doubt many a real <em>baleboosteh</em> has also\nbeen a real <em>ballbuster</em> in her own right.  But the hypothesis\nof an etymological link, while it tickles my linguistic\nfunny-bone, has to leave me unconvinced.</p>\n<p>The third eye-catcher was Arnold M. Zwicky's bilingual\nredundancy game.  I'm sure it will attract many additions.\n<em>Mount Fujiyama</em> calls to mind any number of geographical\nexamples.  Among them: <em>Mount Kilimanjaro</em> (Swahili,\n<em>kilima</em> 'mountain'), <em>Mount Mauna Loa</em> (Hawaiian, <em>mauna</em>\n'mountain'), the <em>Sierra Nevada Mountain Range</em> (Spanish,\n<em>sierra</em> 'mountain range'), the <em>Río Grande River</em> (Spanish,\n<em>río</em> 'river'), the <em>Guadalquivir River</em> (Arabic, <em>guad</em> 'river'),\n<em>The Alhambra</em> (Arabic, <em>al</em> 'the'), etc.  You should also\nprobably receive dozens of letters suggesting the grand-daddy\nof them all, <em>the hoi polloi</em>, though somehow this\ndoesn't offend me too much.  I suppose it's already become\nsuch a cliché that the correct form (without either the <em>the</em>\nor the <em>hoi</em>) would sound almost sillier than the redundancy.\nBut a similar barbarism, bordering on the vulgar,\nnever fails to jar me: “a, b, c, d... 'and <em>et cetera</em>' ” And I\nscrupulously avoid restaurants whose menus boast a “daily\n<em>soup(e) du jour</em>”!\n<em>—Norman R. Shapiro, Wesleyan University</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
