Thus, under “English/<em>Dictionaries</em>,”\nthe first listing is for <em>Altenglisches etymologisches\nWoerterbuch</em>, the second for <em>American Heritage Dictionary\nof the English Language</em> and so on, though <em>Webster's New\nWorld Dictionary</em>, the <em>Random House Dictionary</em>, and many\nothers are missing.  The AMS Press reprint of Johnson's <em>Dictionary</em>\nis there, as are Dixon's <em>English Idioms</em>, the Oxford\n<em>Classical Dictionary</em>, and, all told, 58 works of some diversity.\nTherefore, as can be seen, the list is far from complete.  The\nnext category is “English/<em>Grammars</em>.”  Here are listed such\nitems as Kenyon's <em>American Pronunciation</em> and AMS Press's\nreprint of George Philip Krapp's <em>Pronunciation of Standard\nEnglish in America</em>, with a number of grammars of Old,\nMiddle, and Modern English, some relatively new, some\nquite old, between.  There follow subsections bearing language\ndesignations (Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, etc.) under\nwhich are listed one or more books—grammars, mostly—for\nthe teaching of English to speakers of the subject language.\nUnder Arabic, for instance, is listed <em>Learning English, a\nReview Grammar for Speakers of Arabic</em>.</p>\n<p>Sufficient bibliographic information, including ISBN\nnumbers, is given to identify the books, and prices are given\nas well.  Each book has a Stechert Macmillan catalog number.\nAn alphabetical title index of the dictionaries and grammars\n—but not of the encyclopedias and periodicals—covers about\n40 pages.</p>\n<p>Although no evaluative information is given at all—this\nis not a Winchell or Kister—the listing can be put to very\ngood use by bookshops, libraries, and individuals who are\nseeking data not readily available elsewhere.  Also, one may\nassume that only books that are in print are listed, for order\nforms are provided in the last pages of the catalog.  Although I\nam fully aware of the costs of producing the catalog, I still believe\nthat it would be fair of Stechert Macmillan to offer\ncredit for the purchase price against a certain size of order;\nfor, after all, it is a merchandise catalog, notwithstanding its\nusefulness.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
