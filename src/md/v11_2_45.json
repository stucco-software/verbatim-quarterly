The\nanswer to that question is open to considerable dispute.\nSome standard reference works give the nod to Nathan Bailey\nwho published his dictionary in 1721.  I, however, harbor\nconsiderable fondness for Henry Cockeram who published his\nEnglish dictionary in 1623.  The title page of that work at least\nuses the words “English Dictionarie,” and the alphabetical\nlisting of words contains definitions of considerable charm.  The\ntitle page of the 1623 edition reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The English Dictionarie, or Interpreter of hard English\nWords—Enabling as well Ladies and Gentlewomen,\nyoung Schollers, Clarkes, Merchants, and also Strangers\nof any nation to the Understanding of the more difficult\nauthors already printed in our language, and the\nmore speedy attaining of an elegant perfection of the\nEnglish tongue, both in reading, speaking, and writing.\nBeing a collection of the choisest words contained in\nthe Table Alphabeticall and English Expositor, and of\nsome thousands of words never published by any\nheretofor</p>\n<p>By H. C. Gent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now what more from a dictionary can any reader want?  Henry\nCockeram designed his work to be published in three volumes.\nAs he tells us in “A Premonition from the Author to the\nReader,”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First the method is plaine and easie, being alphabetically,\nby which the capacity of the meanest may soon\nbe inlightened.  The first Booke hath the choisest words\nthemselves now in use, wherewith our language is\ninriched and become so copious, to which words the\ncommon sense is annexed.  The second Booke contains\nthe vulgar words, which whensoever any desirous of a\nmore curious explanation by a more refined and elegant\nspeech shall looke into, he shall there receive the exact\nand ample word to expresse the same: Wherein by the\nway let me pray thee to observe that I have also\ninserted (as occasion served) even the <em>mocke-words</em>\nwhich are ridiculously used in our language, that those\nwho desire a generality of knowledge may not bee\nignorant of the sense, even of the <em>fustian termes</em>, used\nby too many who study rather to bee heard speake,\nthan to understand themselves.  The last Booke is a\nrecitall of severall persons, Gods and Goddesses, Giants\nand Devils, Monsters and Serpents, Birds and Beasts,\nRivers, Fishes, Herbs, Stones, Trees, and the like, to\nthe intent that the diligent learner may not pretend the\ndefect of any helpe which may informe his discourse or\npractice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In one sense, Book Three of Cockeram's work is the great-great\ngranddaddy of <em>The Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em> by the\nReverend E. Cobham Brewer, LL.D.</p>\n<p>We may not know much about the true character of the\nGentleman Cockeram, but there is no doubt that he was a true\nlover of the English language—and of its quirks and peculiarities.\nAnd, if his “Premonition to the Reader,” is a typical\nexample of the man's style, we can also feel a lively and witty\nmind at work.  In addition, he was certainly not given to any\nfalse modesty, for the opening pages of his work contain a\nnumber of verses praising himself.  Nicholas Smith's poem (one\nline short of being a sonnet), wherein the first letters of each\nline spell out (nearly) HENRIE COCKERAM, provides a choice\nexample of a poet unraveling, in the labyrinth of fustian\ndiction, a thick clew of vocabulary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To his very good friend, Master <em>Henry Cockeram</em>, on\nhis Vocabulary</p>\n<p>H e whose seife love, or too ambitious spirit,<br>\nE nvies or carpes at this thy Muses action,<br>\nN ere let him live, or of a Muse once merit<br>\nR egard or fame, but die in his detraction,<br>\nI rrevocably plagu'd with Zoilan spight,<br>\nE re he once taste of Hellicons delight.<br>\nCould I, oh could I quintessence my skill,<br>\nO r with Elixir truly alcumize,<br>\nK nowledge with learning should instruct my quill<br>\nEffectually to praise thy Muses guise,<br>\nRe-felling all the criticall disasters,<br>\nA mong some captious, yet wise seeming masters,<br>\nMade by her curious eye, their owne distasters.<br>\nNICHOLAS SMITH,<br>\n<em>Eques Auratus Encomiastes Posthumus</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Dictionary</em> itself is very rare and very difficult to\nlocate, but Book One is a delight for those readers in search of\nout-of-the way, obsolete, quirky and playful terms.  One rainy\nafternoon, when I should have been cleaning out my closet, I\ndecided to compile a list of choice morsels from Cockeram's\nbook.
