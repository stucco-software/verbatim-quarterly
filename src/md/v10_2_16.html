<p>Earlier this summer <em>The Times</em> of London, God bless her
and all who hack in her, carried the following headline on its
back page: WHO THE UNIONS WANT.  This provoked Mrs. Galina
M. Carter of Cambridgeshire to write to us at VERBATIM in
grief and anger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there nothing that can be done to stop this erosion
of the correct use of 'who' and 'whom'?  English is fortunate
in having a minimum of cases and genders, and
it seems to me that the basic structure of the language
should be maintained, even though the language must
remain flexible and subject to contemporary change.  I
find it distressing when a newspaper with the high
standards and reputation of <em>The Times</em> allows such slovenly
writing and editing.  I suppose the fault lies with
the schools.  But perhaps by publicizing and criticizing
we may be able to influence the trend away from such
carelessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, Mrs. Carter.  We must try to do better.  The truth of
the matter is that we and the rest of our contemporaries have
increasing difficulty with the inflections of our pronouns.  There
are various reasons for this.  One of them, as Mrs. Carter herself
points out, is that our schools no longer teach grammar in any
systematic way.  Indeed a representative of the teacher's biggest
union recently told a Parliamentary select committee that
grammar and spelling were trivial subjects and should not be
taught in schools.</p>
<p>The Sixties generation of boys came out of school thinking:
“I don't have to wear a necktie; I can grow my hair long;
and I can spell how I want.”  The girls had similar thoughts
appropriate to their gender.  These young men and women are
now the sub-editors and compositors who produce our newspapers.
Consequently there has been a relaxation in the strict
rules of old-fashioned style and grammar, causing grief and
pain to readers who were born before the Sixties.</p>
<p>A connected reason or consequence of the change in
attitudes of the Sixties is that the case-endings of our pronouns
are quite rapidly withering away, as the dual case, for example,
of Old English faded away nine centuries ago.  THE MAN WHO
THE UNIONS WANT in the headline still looks illiterate, and
should not have appeared in <em>The Times</em>.  But, when answering
the telephone, today it would sound pedantic and unfriendly to
say: “Whom am I Speaking to?”  All but the most rigid
upholder of Victorian values say: “Who am I speaking to?”  (if
they don't say: “Who's that?”), which can be conveniently
smudged into: “Who'm I speaking to?”  Only the learned owls
of Oxford and Cambridge still hoot “To-who, TO-WHOM” on
every occasion when they should use the accusative.</p>
<p>The A-D section of the Yellow Pages of the London
Telephone Directory has a full page advertisement in huge
print which runs: IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WANT ...
BUT YOU DO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.  I think that their
copywriters would justify the use by saying that <em>who</em> sounds
colloquial and matey, whereas <em>whom</em> would sound prissy and
magisterial.</p>
<p>An even odder relative confusion substitutes <em>whom</em> where
<em>who</em> is correct.  This is odd because in general <em>whom</em> is avoided
in colloquial registers as being old-fashioned and punctiliously
correct.  But when some some other words intrude between the
nominative relative pronoun <em>who</em> and its verb, it has become
conventional to write <em>whom</em> instead of <em>who</em>.  For example, it is
still correct to write: “Ronald Reagan, who is President.”  But it
is becoming correct, or at any rate customary and in due
course idiomatic, to write and say: “Ronald Reagan, whom he
reminded his listeners was President of the United States...!”</p>
<p>I suspect that this peculiarity is didascalogenic (on the
analogy of iatrogenic diseases); as in also, for instance, <em>It's hard
on we girls</em>, and <em>the wine-waiter who served my wife and I</em>.  We
are in a state of uncertainty about the inflections of our
pronouns because of uncertainty in the teaching of grammar,
and, when put to it, in a panic, we often plump for the wrong
inflection.</p>
<p>The aberrant use of <em>whom</em> as a nominative has decent
precedents.  You remember <em>The Tempest</em>: “Young Ferdinand,
<em>whom</em> they suppose is drown'd.”  Remember even higher
authority, with an interrogative rather than a relative pronoun:
“He saith unto them, But <em>whom</em> say ye that I am?”  Of course,
both the Greek and the Vulgate of Matthew XVI, 15, have the
accusative (and of course infinitive) here, because accusative
and infinitive is the Greek and Latin construction for asking an
indirect question.  No doubt the translators of the <em>Authorized
Version</em>, and Wyclif and Tyndale, were influenced by their
classical training.  Maybe Shakespeare was also (or maybe)
writing in a hurry, he was confusing his grammar with another
way of putting the phrase: “Young Ferdinand, <em>whom</em> they
suppose to be drown'd,” an English accusative and infinitive.</p>
<p>Over here we have increasing confusion about the cases of
our pronouns.  How is it over there?  We still try to get them
right in <em>The Times</em>, because our readers were taught grammar,
and care for such precision.  But in the long run, by the next
century, I do not believe that there will be many cases left in
our pronouns to trouble the subs and compositors.  A pity,
would you say?  Well, up to a point, Lord Copper.  Anything
that reduces the distinctions of English coarsens its use.  But
the principal object of language is to communicate meanings
precisely.  And the gradual loss of the last surviving inflections
is not going to impede communication greatly.  In the
meantime, we shall try to use our pronouns properly in <em>The
Times</em>.</p>
