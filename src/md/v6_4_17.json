The word <em>gas</em> was\nhemmed in by single quotation marks because, in the views\nof the editors, <em>gas</em> was still, after the trammeling of usage\nhad almost obliterated the distinction, a short way of spelling\n<em>gasoline</em>.

Nicknames,\nsuch as <em>Richard</em> to <em>Ricky</em> or <em>Rich</em>, are good examples,\nbut the erosion occurs with myriads of other words.\nHence, <em>going to</em> becomes <em>gonna</em>, and <em>supposed</em> becomes\n'<em>sposed</em>.  In his column, “On Language,” Safire cites <em>ongona</em>\nfor <em>I'm going to</em>.  <em>Tho, 'cause</em> or <em>cuz, thru</em>, and '<em>kay</em> are\nother noxious forms.  The humorous writer Peter De Vries\nhas his characters bludgeon <em>probably</em> into <em>probly</em> or <em>prolly</em>,\nand a few are content with the monosyllabic <em>pry</em>, which I\nhad to test before being content that that is indeed how\nsome people pronounce it: “He's pry not here now”; it\nworks.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, some foreshortened forms gain acceptance,\nwhile others remain branded with the stamp of <em>coll</em>.,\n<em>slang</em>, or <em>Amer</em>, <em>dial</em>.  Being somewhat interested in the purity,\nor at least euphony, of the English language, I do not\nwelcome the random slurrings and imprecisions that serve\nto drop consonants and whole syllables from speech.  They\nare mostly oral solecisms, such as <em>Whudja get</em> for “What did\nyou get.”  People exchange whole dialogues in this vein:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Hey, lemme do it, tho.”<br>\n“Uh uh.”<br>\n“C'mon, whyntcha lemme aleas try?”<br>\n“Cause yer only semi-literate.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The possibilities are as varied as individuals, though many\nforms are in common parlance.  Moreover, they depend on\nregional peculiarities and other factors ... and they are so\nnumerous that one is forever beleaguered trying to classify\nthem or even compile a modest collection.</p>\n<p>The other type of shortened form, however, the one\nwhich evolves through the years honestly and thus can be\nfound on the printed page as well as the streets, makes for a\nmore interesting search.  I have compiled a short list of examples\nheretofore unmentioned, though some are inexact\ncut-offs or may be termed borderline cases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>ampere</em>           —             <em>amp</em><br>\n<em>bicycle</em>          —             <em>bike</em> or <em>cycle</em><br>\n<em>brassiere</em>        —             <em>bra</em><br>\n<em>camera obscura</em>   —             <em>camera</em><br>\n<em>debutante</em>        —             <em>deb</em><br>\n<em>detective</em>        —             <em>tec</em><br>\n<em>discotheque</em>      —             <em>disco</em><br>\n<em>disk jockey</em>      —             <em>deejay</em><br>\n<em>flat iron</em>        —             <em>iron</em><br>\n<em>forecastle</em>       —             <em>fo'c'sle</em><br>\n<em>frankfurter</em>      —             <em>frank</em><br>\n<em>gymnasium</em>        —             <em>gym</em><br>\n<em>hamburger</em>        —             <em>burger</em><br>\n<em>headshrinker</em> (psychiatrist) —  <em>shrink</em><br>\n<em>high fidelity</em>     —            <em>hi-fi</em><br>\n<em>introduction</em>      —            <em>intro</em><br>\n<em>jockey</em>            —            <em>jock</em><br>\n<em>kilogram</em>          —            <em>kilo</em><br>\n<em>luncheon</em>          —            <em>lunch</em><br>\n<em>master of ceremonies</em>   —       <em>emcee</em><br>\n<em>moving pictures</em>      —         <em>movies</em> (early slang:<em>moom pitchers)</em><br>\n<em>newspaper</em>            —         <em>news or paper</em><br>\n<em>nuclear bomb</em>         —         <em>nuke</em><br>\n<em>parachute</em>            —         <em>chute</em><br>\n<em>perambulator</em>         —         <em>pram</em><br>\n<em>perquisite</em>           —         <em>perk</em><br>\n<em>postal card</em>          —         <em>postcard</em><br>\n<em>potato</em>               —         <em>tater</em><br>\n<em>preparatory school</em>   —         <em>prep school</em><br>\n<em>psychopath</em>           —         <em>psycho</em><br>\n<em>public house</em>         —         <em>pub</em><br>\n<em>quadrangle</em>           —         <em>quad</em><br>\n<em>recreation room</em>      —         <em>rec room</em><br>\n<em>rock and roll</em>        —         <em>rock</em><br>\n<em>sacrifice</em>            —         <em>sac</em> (in chess, principally)<br>\n<em>schizophrenic</em>        —         <em>schizo</em><br>\n<em>science fiction</em>      —         <em>s.f.

True, there may be hundreds of\nwords that have undergone changes of one kind or another,\nto be found if one follows them far back enough, but the\nforms for which I search—not actively, mind you, but I do\nkeep my ears open—must be of relatively recent vintage.\n<em>Zounds</em> for <em>His wounds, Goodby</em> for <em>God be with you</em>, or,\nin a similar vein, '<em>strewth</em> or <em>ods bodkins</em> would not qualify.</p>\n<p>It is therefore more of an amateur philologist's hunt,\nwhich suits those of that ruminative nature.  <em>Oleomargarine</em>\nand <em>refrigerator</em> are my two latest finds, though purists\nmight object to <em>fridge</em>.  I, for one, do not entirely accept <em>percolate</em>\nwith its diminutive <em>perk</em>.  There are also quite a few\nphrases whose original endings often trail off nowadays,\nbut, well, <em>de gustibus</em>...</p>",
