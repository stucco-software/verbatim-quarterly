If the subject seems to cleave to the\nanatomical, the subtitle explains: “A visceral approach to\nwords and their origins.”</p>\n<p>I can say only that I wish the subject had been\nbroader, for Mrs. Sperling has included a number of\nmetaphors whose sense and origin are so obvious as to make\nreading about them quite redundant. Those expressions that\ndo not yield readily to analysis-<em>break a leg!</em>, <em>thumbs\ndown</em>, <em>lick one's chops</em>, and others-are treated well, but\nthey are scattered here and there among the obvious. Why\nshould anyone need an explanation of <em>the walls have ears</em> or\n<em>a hair-raising experience</em>? And some of these have been in\nthe language for so long that providing a single source in\ncertain cases can invite only contumely from those who can\nreadily find earlier citations. An attractive book with neatly\ndone illustrations by Michael C. Witte, <em>Tenderfeet</em> would\nmake a fine gift.  <em>[L.U.]</em></p>",
