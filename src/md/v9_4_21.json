Although this dictionary contains\nmuch material that is universal, it also lists entries that are of\nAboriginal origin.  Each entry is carefully labeled as to its\nsource: <em>Aboriginal (A.), Fleet Air Arm (F.A.A.), Merchant\nService (M.S.), Navy (N.),</em> or <em>Waterfront (W.)</em>.</p>\n<p>It is indeed a lively work, with brief, well-written definitions,\nsome of which reflect a measure of informality that, if\ncopied by other lexicographic works, would make them infinitely\nmore interesting and readable.  For instance:</p>\n<p><em>International Club</em> <em>N. &amp; M.S.</em>  The only facility for sailor's\nrecreation in the ports of Murmansk and Archangel during\nWorld War II.  The entertainment and fraternisation was [<em>sic</em>]\nso strictly policed by the Russian Secret Police that one visit\nsatisfied most sailors.</p>\n<p><em>Fly the blue pigeon</em> <em>N.</em>  To swing the lead when taking\nsoundings.  A vigorous swing made the lead 'coo' like a pigeon.</p>\n<p>Some of these explanations are, as can be seen, quite revealing\nand therefore very useful.</p>\n<p>Focusing on what is in the book rather than criticizing it\nfor what it omits, one finds not only the familiar—<em>Eye of the\nwind; Factory ship; Slinging hash</em>—but the picturesque—<em>Ecclesiastical\nbricks</em> 'holystones'; <em>Everyone gets kicked and the\ncabin boy kicks the cat; Tonsil varnish</em>—and the mysterious—\n<em>Number Ten</em> <em>N</em>.  “A punishment introduced by Winston\nChurchill in 1912.”  If this last is so called because of <em>Number\nTen Downing Street</em>, the reference for 1912 is elusive; if it\nrefers to 'ten lashes' or some other punishment, that is not\nexpressed.  It would be interesting to know why 'A recoverable\ntest vehicle used in aircraft carriers to test the aircraft launching\ncatapult' is called a <em>Chloe</em>.</p>\n<p>Not all of the entries are nautical: <em>Gefuffle</em> (more commonly\n<em>kerfuffle</em> or <em>kafuffle</em>); <em>Bottoms up; Clap;</em> etc.  To make up\nfor those, one finds a fair number of entries that trace their\norigins to old sea shanties and ditties, and these are quoted\nthrough (usually) a full stanza and, if appropriate, a chorus.</p>\n<p>Lew Lind is identified as a “New Public Relations Officer\nand Foundation National President of The Naval Historical\nSociety of Australia,” though the precise import of the latter\ntitle I cannot fathom.  He writes interestingly and, to be sure,\nhas here gathered a useful, anecdotal log of entries for sailor\nand landlubber alike.</p>\n<p>The book contains some drawings and halftones; some of\nthese illustrate entries, others are—or seem to be—purely\ndecorative in purpose.  My only adverse criticism is of the style\nof the main entry, which is always shown with an initial capital\nletter, but that might well have been the publisher's unfortunate\nerror.  Anyone who couldn't appreciate and enjoy this\nbook for what it is couldn't <em>see a hole through a ladder.</em></p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
