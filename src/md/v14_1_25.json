Granted that an occasional exception may\nprove a rule, but this rule has so many exceptions that\nthe exceptions bury the rule.</p>\n<p>To begin with, the most famous of all spelling jingles\nhas a small amendment tacked on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I</em> before <em>e</em>,<br>\nExcept after <em>c</em>,<br>\nUnless sounded as <em>a</em>,<br>\nAs in <em>neighbor</em> and <em>weigh</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last two lines suggest exceptions such as <em>beige,\ndeign, eight, feign, feint, geisha, heinous, heir,\ninveigh, inveigle, lei, neigh, neighbor, reign, rein,\nreindeer, skein, sleigh, their, veil, vein, weigh</em>, and\n<em>weight</em>.  That makes twenty-three exceptions to the <em>i</em>\nbefore <em>e</em> rule already.</p>\n<p>Another batch of exceptions consists of words in\nwhich both the <em>e</em> and the <em>i</em> are sounded: <em>absenteeism,\nagreeing, albeit, atheist, being, contemporaneity, fleeing,\nfreeing, guaranteeing, pedigreeing, plebeian,\nreify, reimburse, reincarnate, reinfect, reinforce,\nreinstate, reinsure, reintegrate, reinterpret, reinvent,\nreinvest, reissue, reiterate, seeing, simultaneity, spontaneity,\nteeing</em>, and <em>treeing</em>.  That raises the total of\nexceptions to fifty-two.</p>\n<p>Now it does not take a genius to realize that the <em>i</em>\nbefore <em>e</em> rule does not work for the names of many\npeople and places: Eugene <em>O'Neill</em> and Dwight <em>Eisenhower</em>\ndrank <em>Budweiser</em> and <em>Rheingold</em> in <em>Anaheim</em>\nand <em>Leicester</em>.  We could add a long scroll of names to\nthis cluster, like <em>Steinham</em> and <em>Weiss</em>, but we shall settle\nfor fifty-eight rule-flouters at this point.</p>\n<p>Here are thirty blatant breaches of the <em>i</em> before <em>e</em>\ndictum that do not involve names, separately pronounced\nvowels, or the long <em>a</em> sound: <em>caffeine,\ncodeine, counterfeit, eiderdown, either, Fahrenheit,\nfeisty, foreign, forfeit, heifer, heigh ho, height, heist,\nkaleidoscope, keister, leisure, neither, nonpareil, obeisance,\nonomatopeia, protein, seismograph, seize,\nsheikh, sleight, sovereign, stein, surfeit, Weimaraner</em>,\nand <em>weird</em>.</p>\n<p>We are now up to eighty-eight exceptions, with\nmiles to go before we sleep.  For we must remember\nthat the rule proclaims that <em>i</em> comes before <em>e</em>, except\nafter <em>c</em>.  This concept works perfectly well for words\nlike <em>receive</em> and <em>ceiling</em>, but what about words in\nwhich <em>c</em> is followed by <em>ie</em>?: <em>agencies, ancient, concierge,\nconscience, conscientious, contingencies, currencies,\nemergencies, fallacies, fancied, financier,\nglacier, mercies, omniscient, policies, prescient, science,\nsociety, species, sufficient</em>, and <em>tendencies</em>.</p>\n<p>Now have a look at three more words of this type:\n<em>deficiencies, efficiencies</em>, and <em>proficiencies</em>.  Note that\nthese are double plays, each shattering the rule twice\nwithin a few syllables.  But we shall count each as only\na single violation, bringing our accumulation to 112.</p>\n<p>In the same category, if we are to move upward\nand outward, we shall have to consult with a genius,\nlike Albert <em>Einstein</em>.  Einstein would point out that his\nsurname is another double violation.  But again we\nshall be lenient and count him as one, bringing our\ntotal to 113.</p>\n<p>Einstein might also spout arcane words like <em>beidellite,\ncorporeity, cuneiform, deice, deictic, deionize,\neidolon, exigencies, femininity, gaseity, greige,\nhermaphrodeity, heterogeneity, homogeneity, leifite,\nleister, leitmotif, Manichaeism, meiosis, mythopoeic,\npeiramater, reive, rheic, seity, sulphureity, weibullite,\nweir, xanthoproteic, zein</em>, and <em>zeitgeist</em> (another\ndouble).</p>\n<p>These thirty everyday words raise our total of\nexceptions to the <em>i</em> before <em>e</em> rule to 143, just one away\nfrom proving that the famous spelling aphorism is\ngrossly misleading.</p>\n<p>So we ask: is there one more common exception\nthat will bring the count to a satisfying dozen dozen?\nFor the answer we'll have to consult with the <em>Deity</em>.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
