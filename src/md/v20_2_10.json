Hauptman is a smart feller (as he might say) and has pulled together a collection that is bound to amuse devotees. Fully twenty per cent of the book is taken up by the Introduction, but that is all right, for the Introduction is riddled with all sorts of wordplay. The emphasis must be on <em>play</em>, for it is one thing to tolerate twists of logic, another to tolerate contorted language, as exemplified by the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jack the Ripper's grandmother had a minor behavioral problem of her own. Armed with a switchblade, she attacked visitors to a London public lavatory. Terrified citizens called her the old woman who shivved in a loo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many may complain that I am being too finicky in objecting to <em>shiv</em> as a verb and to the fact that a <em>loo</em> is any lavatory, not necessarily a public one. But, as readers of VERBATIM are only too well aware, even worse examples have been perpetrated in these pages. In the context of this review, I cannot resist releasing one that already requires some historical perspective to understand:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tourist: Why are you chewing on your mukluk, Gooneeweetuk?</p>\n<p>Goonee: 'Cause it's the only shoe my mother lets me gum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That, to me, is a cruel pun; it unusualness depends on whether one has heard it or not. That one and all the following are original with me, but that does not mean they have never been uttered before. My own preference is for spontaneous puns, those that crop up in the course of conversation and are not recited, like jokes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. Someone was telling me about a Jewish family in India that had converted to Hinduism, and I commented, “I guess that's a case of <em>deva ju</em>.”</p>\n<p>2. Landmark Commission notice to owner of two important historic buildings: “A plaque on both your houses.”</p>\n<p>3. What could be sadder than driving a Saab over depressed sewers?</p>\n<p>4. In Britain, when a telephone operator makes a connection for you, she says “You're through,” before you've had a chance to say one word!</p>\n<p>5. Definitions:</p>\n<p><em>common scents</em>—body odors</p>\n<p><em>crewelwork</em>—sadistic needling</p>\n<p><em>lighthouses</em>—castles in the air</p>\n<p><em>serial port</em>—computer connection for grain shipments</p>\n<p><em>row boat</em>—vessel for caviar</p>\n<p><em>bag dad</em>—male derelict in Iraq</p>\n<p>6. Great classics:</p>\n<p><em>Rebecca of Donnybrook Farm</em></p>\n<p><em>The Flying Dustman</em></p>\n<p><em>The Man on the Flying Tapis</em></p>\n<p><em>Olive or Twist</em> (bar manual)</p>\n<p>7. Folk etymology is the kind of scholarship that relates <em>sackbut</em> with <em>bagasse</em>.</p>\n<p>8. “He has water in the chest cavity; it's called hydrothorax.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is that anything like the Intercostal Waterway?”</p>\n<p>9. He: “You look in the pink tonight.”</p>\n<p>She: “Actually, I'm inviolate.”</p>\n<p>10. Wrigley was known as a man who would stick by his gums.</p>\n<p>11. She didn't consider him worth her wiles.</p>\n<p>12. Degeneration of Vipers—result of inefficient vindshield cleaning</p>\n<p>13. Preventive dentistry is a precarious business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Still, many of the items in Hauptman's collection are very funny, though some are neither puns nor spoonerisms. One gets the impression that he has collected a lot of jokes from <em>Playboy, New York Magazine</em>, and other sources and tried to find a common denominator for them in a title. There is a rich mine of linguistic humor here, and one should pay attention to the material not to the title.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
