(The English are\nsatisfied with the simple word “side.”)  For a long time I have\ncherished the hypothesis that it comes from a mispronunciation\nof “anglish,” since the ball always rebounds at an erratic\nangle when put under spin.  I even thought that investigation\nmight uncover a French culprit in the woodpile, i.e., <em>anglé</em>,\n'angled,' easily confused with <em>anglais</em>, 'English.'

Imagine my disappointment at learning (from the\n<em>OED Supplement</em>, quoting the <em>Sunday Times</em>, 5 April 1959)\nthat the billiard term, traced at least as far back as Mark\nTwain's <em>Innocents Abroad</em> (1869), supposedly comes from a\nbanal proper name:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The story goes that an enterprising gentleman from\nthese shores travelled to the United States during\nthe latter part of the last century and impressed\nthe Americans with a demonstration of the effect of\n'side' on pool or billiard balls.  His name was English.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I say 'supposedly' because the quoted etymology still strikes\nme as very possibly apocryphal, whether or not my own is\ncloser to the mark.</p>\n<p>At any rate, even assuming the shadowy Mr. English to\nbe responsible, after a little reflection it occurred to me that\nthe two hypotheses might, in fact, come together rather neatly.\nThe English, after all, stem from the Angles, who, we are told,\ntook their name from their original homeland in Schleswig,\nwhose shape was that of a fishhook (<em>angul</em>).  If so, we have\nwhat would amount to a stunning etymological coincidence.\nConsidering the immense number of possible proper names\nan itinerant billiard-shark might have, we could easily be\nreferring today to 'reverse smith,' 'reverse jones,' 'reverse\nshapiro,' 'reverse urdang,' etc., none of which staggering\narray of possiblities would have anything whatever to do\nwith the 'angle' that so expressively describes the trick shot\ninvolved.
