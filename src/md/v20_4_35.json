As Random House was not collecting citations till the mid 1940s, in the preparation of the <em>American College Dictionary</em>, it would appear that the information in the <em>RHD2c</em> has been derived from the <em>OED</em>, which gives 1938 as the date of its first citation (from <em>The New York Times)</em>. I may not be looking in the right place in the <em>RHD2e</em>, but I was unable to find any acknowledgment in its pages to the <em>OED</em>, though in the Preface to the Second Edition [p. vii] acknowledgment is made to the <em>Linguistic Atlas of the United States</em> and to the <em>Dictionary of American Regional English</em>—though as projects, not as copyright works. Does this mean that R. W. Burchfield has still more ammunition for the guns he has loaded against what he calls “plagiarism”? It is well known that facts are not copyright; though the wording in which they are couched certainly is copyrightable, a date, per se, could not fall into that category. One is left to draw his own conclusions. Perhaps acknowledging a source of information, though not required by law, would be the nice, polite thing to do, and such acknowledgment, which usually appears in infinitesimally small type in a place where no one but a lexicographer, publisher, publisher's lawyer, or other troublemaker might look, would in no way diminish the reputations of truly good works (like the various dictionaries published by Random House and others).</p>\n<p>The foregoing has only marginal relevance to the book at hand, which is an amazing work. Following a lengthy, illuminating, and thorough study of neologisms by John Algeo, one that is not ony synchronic but delves into the history of the “Among the New Words” section of <em>American Speech</em>, is a Glossary of all the words treated; this also serves as an index, citing chapter and verse where the original entry can be found in the reproduced articles that occupy the last 190 pages of the book; between is an alphabetical listing of the many contributors. The articles are reprinted in full, in reduced but clearly legible type, from the first, April 1941, to the last included (Winter 1990) just prior to the preparation of this book.</p>\n<p>This book is a word-lover's dream come true. Browsing through the Glossary reveals a lifetime of lexicon, one is reminded of words that have come and gone (<em>corrigan</em> [after “Wrong-way” Corrigan, the errant pilot], <em>sitzkrieg, Herrenvolk)</em>, and—most amazingly—those that have come and stayed. In the latter category one is surprised to learn that words that seem to have been there “always” were coined only fifty years ago: (air-raid) <em>alert, blacktop, blitz, bra, brass hat, burp, car hop, curvaceous, lay an egg</em> 'fail,' <em>fellow traveler, fuddy-duddy, G-string, leg up</em> 'boost,' <em>newsworthy, prototype</em>, and <em>winterize</em>. These are selected from the very first “Among the New Words,” prepared by Dwight L. Bolinger, who also noted the increased use of the suffix -<em>er</em> in the sense of 'someone or something associated with' the noun to which it is suffixed, like <em>first termer, party-liner</em>, and <em>rank-and-filer</em>.</p>\n<p>John Algeo, with his wife Adele, is now in charge of this valuable and interesting archival section of <em>American Speech</em>, a scholarly periodical published by the University of Alabama Press. It should be emphasized that not only American English is included, though the collection is preponderantly so.</p>\n<p>Cambridge delights us with such a publication: making it available in paperback (8½\"×11\") at such an affordable price leaves few with any excuse for not owning a copy.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
