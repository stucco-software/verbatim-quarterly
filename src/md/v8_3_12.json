However,\nthe perceptive British listener can detect which part of\nthe country a man (or woman) comes from, and perhaps\nalso which social class he belongs to, by which of the\nthree words he uses.  And <em>whin</em> is also used to describe\nother thorny plants with yellow flowers.  I am not sure\nthat the British English <em>pavement</em> is an exact synonym\nfor the American <em>sidewalk</em>.  With such a huge lexicon of\ndelicately shaded near-synonyms to choose from, the\nbest writers and speakers will take pains to select\nexactly the right word for the job they have in mind.  As\nthe Duchess said to Alice: “Take care of the sense, and\nthe sounds will take care of themselves.”</p>\n<p>This new sort of dictionary is intended to help us in\nthe selection of the right word from the vast choice\navailable.  Two years ago Adrian Room published his\n<em>Dictionary of Confusibles</em> (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul,\n£4.95), distinguishing between pairs or larger groups of\nwords that look alike, sound alike, are sometimes spelt\nalike, and, by golly, have a common semantic link:\nwords like <em>baroque</em> and <em>rococo</em>, or <em>twerp</em> and <em>twat</em>.  The\nbook did well; so here is its successor, dealing with\n<em>distinguishables</em>.  Distinguishables do not sound alike or\nlook alike, but their meanings overlap, for example,\n<em>midge, gnat</em>, and <em>mosquito</em>, or <em>divan</em> and <em>couch</em>.  Moreover,\na confusible can be any part of speech, whereas\nMr. Room's distinguishables are all nouns.</p>\n<p>The best place to find the exact meaning of a word\nof which one is in doubt is in a big dictionary, with\ncitations and examples.  With distinguishables one will\nneed to look up both words and compare the meanings\ncarefully, which will take time.  And anyway not all of us\nhave by our desks an adequate array of big dictionaries\nand encyclopedias for all the changes and chances of the\nintolerable wrestle with words and meanings.  This dictionary\ndistinguishes more than 1,300 nouns with overlapping\nmeanings, and, where it helps, gives a little line\ndrawing, for instance to distinguish between <em>domes</em> and\n<em>cupolas</em>.  Sydney Smith said that “the dome of St. Paul's\nhas come down to Brighton and pupped” (viz. the\ncupolas on Brighton Pavilion).  The headwords range\nfrom the simple to the abstruse.  Surely every schoolboy\nknows the difference between <em>billiards</em> and <em>pool</em>, even\nif obdurate townees are not sure about the difference\nbetween a <em>partridge</em> and a <em>pheasant</em>.  But can you\ndiscriminate between a <em>type I error</em> and a <em>type II error</em>\nin statistics?  For the shaky among us, a <em>type I error</em> is 'a\nrejection of the null hypothesis in statistical testing\nwhen it is true,' and a <em>type II error</em> is 'an acceptance of\nthe null hypothesis in statistical testing when it is false.'\nI daresay that the distinction will come in useful one\nday for something or other.</p>\n<p>But there are some very pretty, witty, and fine\ndistinctions between words that are likely to prove more\nuseful, for example, the exact difference between a <em>Nosy\nParker, Paul Pry, Peeping Tom,</em> and the female <em>Rosa\nDartle</em>.  Words that are simple British English\nequivalents for American English <em>(lift/elevator)</em> are not\nincluded.  I am not sure that Mr. Room is as sound on his\nAmerican English as his British.  American readers will\nknow better than I whether <em>ass</em> is really used in the\nUnited States to mean 'sexual intercourse.'  And having\ndived into <em>Webster</em>, I see that the meaning is given\nthere, “usually considered vulgar.”  Well, well, I knew\nthat you used it to mean <em>bum</em>, and <em>arse</em>, and that part of\nthe body generally, but I had not realized it could mean\nthe dirty deed itself.  The distinction between producers\nand directors varies widely between cinema and stage\nover here, and I suspect that Mr. Room's British distinctions\nmay well be scrambled on your side of the word-pond.\nHis distinction between <em>morning</em> and <em>evening\ndress</em> does not work for the States, and it is obsolescent\nfor Britain.  I regret to tell you that chaps here are\nwearing <em>pullovers</em> of many colours <em>(jerseys?  sweaters?\njumpers?)</em> with their evening dress, and sponge bag\ntrousers, as worn by Pop (the self-electing society of\nprefects at Eton), have become very fashionable with\nthat absurd rig, <em>morning dress</em>.</p>\n<p>One can grumble about omissions.  Wot, no distinction\nbetween <em>meiosis</em> and <em>litotes,</em> or <em>iambus</em> and <em>spondee?</em>\nSuch grumbles reflect the personal needs and\ninterests of the grumbler.  One can find errors: the\ndifference between <em>tart</em> and <em>pie</em> is not simply that a <em>tart</em>\nhas no top crust.  In the north of England and Scotland,\ntarts, if they contain something sweet or fruit, have top\ncrusts.  <em>Pies</em>, as in <em>mutton pie</em>, are reserved for pastry\ncasings enclosing something savoury—and very greasy\nthey are too.  If we are going to discriminate between\n<em>balcony</em> and <em>verandah</em>, ought we not also to consider\n<em>loggias, porches</em>, and <em>porticoes?</em></p>\n<p>Enough churlish grumbling and whinging.  It is a\nuseful little book, generally sound and agreeably written.\nThose without the big lexicographical guns may\nkeep it on their desks to bolster their vocabularies.\nOthers can keep it by the bed or lavatory for brief\nentertainment and education.  I am extremely chuffed at\nlast to know the difference between <em>appoggiatura</em> and\n<em>acciaccatura</em>.  I have been wondering about that for\nyears.</p>\n<p>—<em>Philip Howard</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
