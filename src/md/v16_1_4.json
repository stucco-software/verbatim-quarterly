What did he say?</p>\n<p>R: <em>“Doc, note, I dissent.  A fast never prevents a\nfatness.  I diet on cod.”</em></p>\n<p>L: Doctor Rotcod, in addition to your fame in\nmedical circles, you are well-known for your\npassionate hatred of evil.</p>\n<p>R: <em>Evil is a name of foeman, as I live</em>.</p>\n<p>L: Then what is your advice to those who seek the\ngood life?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Live not on evil</em>.</p>\n<p>L: How can one do that?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Repel evil as a live leper</em>.</p>\n<p>L: Do you then wish to stamp out all lies?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Live on evasions?

No maid was Eve</em>.</p>\n<p>L: And what happened when Eve offered the fruit\nto Adam?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Won't lovers revolt now?</em></p>\n<p>L: So they sinned together?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Named under a ban—a bared, nude man</em>.</p>\n<p>L: And the result was...?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Eve damned Eden, mad Eve</em>.</p>\n<p>L: Can we ever escape the influence of that act?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Her Eve's noose we soon sever, eh?</em></p>\n<p>L: Well, can we?</p>\n<p>R: <em>No, evils live on</em>.</p>\n<p>L: Did you yourself ever sin, Doctor?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Lived as a devil</em>.</p>\n<p>L: How so?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Evil did I dwell, lewd I did live</em>.</p>\n<p>L: And what was the result of that life?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Reviled did I live; evil I did deliver</em>.</p>\n<p>L: Apparently, you began to despair of ever overcoming\nevil.  What did you think?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Do good's deeds live on?  No, evil's deeds do, O\nGod</em>.</p>\n<p>L: I imagine that this state of affairs made you\nquite miserable.</p>\n<p>R: <em>Egad, a base life defiles a bad age</em>.</p>\n<p>L: Did you ever despair that evil could be conquered?</p>\n<p>R: <em>No, it can—action!</em></p>\n<p>L: So you dedicated your life to fighting evil?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Now do I repay a period won</em>.</p>\n<p>L: And you have fought evil with good?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Did I do, O God, did I as I said I'd do?  Good, I\ndid!</em></p>\n<p>L: Have you finally won your battle against sin?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Now, sir, a war is won</em>.</p>\n<p>L: Do you feel good about all this?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Revered now I live on.  O, did I do no evil, I\nwonder, ever?</em></p>\n<p>L: I understand that your colleagues in virtue have\nno doubts that they will have their reward in\nheaven.</p>\n<p>R: <em>Nor I, fool, ah no!  We won halo—of iron!</em></p>\n<p>L: And what will happen to you few who have\nseen the light?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward\nto new era?</em></p>\n<p>L: Doctor Rotcod, I thank you for this two-way\ninterview.  But how do you do it?  How are you\nable to speak in palindromes so skillfully?</p>\n<p>R: <em>Because if I didn't, I'd sound something like\nthis: “sihte kilg niht emos dnuos ditn didifie\nsuaceb.”</em></p>",
