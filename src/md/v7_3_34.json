But we could not resist setting forth a few of our\nefforts that resulted from the preholiday silly season that\npervades these offices. Please let me know if you would like\nto continue to see “Paring Pairs” in VERBATIM and, of\ncourse, we should like to know if you like the “Anglo-American\nCrossword.” If readers do not protest too loudly,\nwe shall continue both in future issues.</p>",
