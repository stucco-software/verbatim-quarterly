For readers of the language whose mother tongue is Hebrew, English brings an additional challenge, learning a new <em>alef bet</em> 'Alphabet' with its accompanying new rules.</p>\n<p>Hebrew has a script generally written without vowels—except for prayer books and books for little children. After the first few years in school, children do without them. The vowels are marks above and mainly below the consonants:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>S CN B SN N THS XMPL</em></p>\n<p>A A E EE I I EA E</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the time children start to learn English they are fluent readers and writers of vowelless Hebrew. Consequently, learners of English or of any Latin script language tend to skip a few vowels here and there in a cavalier manner, or, if you prefer, with Israeli chutzpa, as if they were saying, “BG DL, they're only stpd vwls, we'll pt a few in fr th stpd tchr who cn't rd English without them.”</p>\n<p>In addition, several consonants do double duty by adding a dot within the letter. Thus, V.=B, f.=p, k.h=k, .s=s, and S.=SH. These marks are also discarded with the vowels, so that often one has to understand by context. That is difficult for foreign students of Hebrew, but we are not dealing with these poor souls here. What we are dealing with is our schoolchildren, who are writing, “Why get ufset ober a pew consonants?”</p>\n<p>Hebrew shuns initial <em>v, f, kh,</em> and final <em>b, p, k</em>. So <em>Philip</em> would be “PILIF” and <em>verb</em> would be “BERV.” Are you still with me, dear readers of <em>BRVTM</em>?</p>\n<p>Learners of English are also troubled by words like <em>film, corn,</em> and <em>charm</em>. Not only is the lack of a vowel sound between the consonants unacceptable, but the <em>l</em> and <em>r</em> are pronounced in all their glory: “FILLIM, CORREN, CHARREM.” The fact that the vowels are not written does not prove that they are not there, does it? The word “fillim” — “pillim” for the more literate—is very popular. -<em>im</em> being the usual masculine plural ending, our offspring say, “I have two fillim, one fil in my camera and the other in reserve.” I wonder what the singular of <em>Verbatim</em> is. ... “Corren Pleckess” is a popular breakfast food, replacing “Kvakair” Oats.</p>\n<p>Of course, learners who realize that most plurals are formed in English by adding -<em>s</em> or -<em>es</em> have been known to speak of “two ambulance, one ambulan.” However, the singular of <em>rail</em> 'any metal bar' is pronounced “RELLS,” plural “RELLSIM.”</p>\n<p><em>Exhaust,</em> a word much loved in auto repair shops, has become “EGGZOZZ” and is so transliterated into Hebrew.</p>\n<p>Still, there is yet hope: now that Israel has signed a peace treaty with Jordan, the sign at the frontier near my home warning approaching persons of “DANGER, FRONT BEHIND!” has been taken down.</p>\n<p><em>Villon's Straight Tip to All Cross Coves</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<em>Tout aux tavernes et aux fiells</em>”</p>\n<p>William Ernest Henley</p>\n<p>Suppose you screeve? or go cheap-jack?</p>\n<p>Or fake the broads? or fig a nag?</p>\n<p>Or thimble-rig? or knap a yack?</p>\n<p>Or pitch a snide? or smash a rag?</p>\n<p>Suppose you duff? or nose and lag?</p>\n<p>Or get the straight, and land your pot?</p>\n<p>How do you melt the multy swag?</p>\n<p>Booze and the blowens cop the lot.</p>\n<p>Fiddle, or fence, or mace, or mack;</p>\n<p>Or moskeneer, or flash the drag;</p>\n<p>Dead-lurk a crib, or do a crack;</p>\n<p>Pad with a slang, or chuck a fag;</p>\n<p>Bonnet, or tout, or mump and gag;</p>\n<p>Rattle the tats, or mark the spot;</p>\n<p>You cannot bag a single stag;</p>\n<p>Booze and the blowens cop the lot.</p>\n<p>Suppose you try a different tack,</p>\n<p>And on the square you flash your flag?</p>\n<p>At penny-a-lining make your whack,</p>\n<p>Or with the mummers mug and gag?</p>\n<p>For nix, for nix the dibbs you bag!</p>\n<p>At any graft, no matter what,</p>\n<p>Your merry goblins soon stravag:</p>\n<p>Booze and the blowens cop the lot.</p>\n<p><em>The Moral</em></p>\n<p>It's up the spout and Charley Wag With wipes and tickers and what not Until the squeezer nips your scrag, Booze and the blowens cop the lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I encountered William Ernest Henley's translation of a Villon poem and have had a time translating it. Finally, after exhausting the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, I found Partridge's <em>Dictionary of Slang and Unusual Words</em>, which has almost all the expressions in it. I offer a simple glossary of terms that might be unfamiliar, should anyone else wish to enjoy the poem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>cross coves</em>—crooked fellows</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>tout aux tavernes et aux fiells</em>—to the taverns and to the “bitter gall” and “bile,” which I believe to be synecdoche for 'evil women.'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>screeve</em>—from the French “<em>escriver</em>” (<em>écriver</em>) 'to write,' means 'to write begging letters.'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>cheap jack</em>—to go out into the country with a pack on your back, selling ribbons, needles, etc., to the country folk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>fake the broads</em>—broads are the three queens in a three-card monte game, and faking broads would be setting up the usual fraudulent game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>fig a nag</em>—to fix a horse up so that it looks better than it really is for fraudulent sale.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>thimble-rig</em>—the equivalent of three-card monte, only with three thimbles and a pea, where the sucker guesses which thimble has the pea under it; shell game; another cheating game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>knap a yack—knap</em> is a 'cheating throw at dice,' and <em>yack</em> is the 'sound of finger beating on the forehead'; it means 'cheating dice.'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>pitch a snide</em>—push counterfeit money.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>smash a rag</em>—steal a handkerchief.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>duff</em>—fix something to look better than it is for fraudulent sale.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>nose and lag—nose</em> a 'police informer'; <em>lag</em> a police informer inside a prison.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>get the straight</em>—have a little luck and win.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>land your pot</em>—make some money.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>melt</em>—get rid of or spend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>multy</em>—an augmentative word, empty of meaning: like saying <em>goddamn</em> or <em>bloody</em> or some other expletive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>swag</em>—loot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>blowens</em>—trulls or whores.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>cop the lot</em>—get everything.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>fiddle</em>—cheat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>fence</em>—buy and sell stolen goods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>mace</em>—swindling or robbery by fraud.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>mack</em>—pimp.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>moskeneer</em>—a <em>mosker</em> sells or pawns things at pawn shops for more than their true value, frequently with a story of need or some other fraudulent con.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>flash the drag</em>—(of a man) to wear women's clothes with “immoral” purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>dead-lurk</em>—steal from something during church service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>crib</em>—a brothel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>do a crack</em>—do a robbery or burglary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>pad with a slang</em>—walk about with a sales permit to sell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>chuck a fag</em>—boost a very small boy up to a barred window so that he can get through the bars and into the house to open the door for his accomplices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>bonnet</em>—a <em>shill</em> or <em>capper</em> for a <em>thimble-rigger</em> or a <em>broad-faker</em>: an accomplice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>tout</em>—to sell information at horse races for a percentage of the net made on the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>mump and gag</em>—grimace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>rattle the tats</em>—shake dice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>mark the spot</em>—mark cards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>stag</em>—shilling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>on the square</em>—honestly, from the masonic symbol of the try square.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>flash your flag</em>—try.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>penny-a-lining make your whack</em>—make an attempt to write.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>mummers</em>—a disparaging word for actors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>mug and gag</em>—make faces and clown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>goblins</em>—gold sovereigns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>stravag</em>—extravagate: wander about.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>up the spout</em>—at pawn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Charley Wag</em>—a thimble-rigger or other criminal; pawnbroker.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>wipes</em>—handkerchiefs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>tickers</em>—watches.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>squeezer</em>—the hangman's noose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>nips your scrag</em>—squeezes your neck.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>William Ernest Henley had tuberculosis of the bone, was hospitalized for years and treated by Lord Lister himself with, I believe, scraping of the bone, and whatever primitive antisepsis was used in those days, probably carbolic acid. Henley endured years of agony, and his poem, “Invictus,” was truly written from experience.</p>\n<p><em>[Murray C. Zimmerman, M.D. Whittier, California]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
