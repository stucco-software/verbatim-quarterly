On American wedding invitations <em>honor</em> is often still spelled <em>honour</em>, some pretentious theatrical enterprises in the USA spell theater <em>theatre</em>, and in mustard ads on American television you won't hear filthy-rich senior citizens say, “Hey, bud, you got any Grey Poupon?”</p>\n<p>I find cultivated English speech often hard to understand, nor do I think this is entirely owing to unfamiliarity with U phonology. The fact that there is no distinction in the British pronunciation of some words, such as <em>sword/sawed</em>, that I pronounce differently supports my idea that my English is phonemically fuller than even cultivated British speech.</p>\n<p>And then there is the case of my friend who feared for her hearing. A few years ago she consulted a physician specializing in auditory problems. The doctor examined her inner ears and tested her hearing, which he found normal, and then asked, “Why did you think you were going deaf?” My friend replied, “Well, lately I have had trouble understanding what people are saying—especially on TV.” “What do you watch on TV?” the doctor wanted to know. “Not much lately. I'm down pretty much just to <em>Masterpiece Theatre</em>.” “Well, there's your answer,” the doctor said; “I can't understand that British English, either.”</p>\n<p><em>[William H.
