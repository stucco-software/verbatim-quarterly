Treichler, (Pandora Press\n(Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul), 1985), x + 587pp.</p>\n<p>Where to begin?  With the unpleasant little entry\nfor <em>lexicographer?</em>  With the nasty piece on <em>dictionary?</em>\nwith the inaccurate definition of <em>grammar?</em> the somewhat\nsilly entry at <em>language?</em>  It is hard to tell.  It is, in\nfact, hard to tell if this is really a dictionary in the\nusual sense of the word: much of it is a book of quotations\n(mostly) from the writings of militant feminists.\nIt is universally condemnatory and bitterly sarcastic, a\nrelentless diatribe against men, males, the masculine\ngender and, particularly, all who are seen to purvey\nlanguage as the medium of oppression.  As an expression\n(= 'outpouring') of propaganada, it is well done;\nas a dictionary and what we usually mean by that\nterm, it is Biercian—but totally devoid of humor or,\nindeed, any compensatory qualities to mitigate its\nviciousness.  Were I a woman, perhaps I might not feel\nso angry with it, but I should probably be made angry\nby it.  As a man, I am irritated by its provocations,\nwhich would annoy any man by blaming all men for\nthe injustices women have undoubtedly suffered\nthroughout the ages.  Language undergoes semantic\nchange under myriad influences, many of which are\npoorly understood.  If such change can be accelerated\nby propaganda, I have no objection to that.  I object to\nthe notion that change can be legislated.</p>\n<p>There are some aspects of this book that are good,\nsome that are bad and, possibly, self-defeating.  The\nworst in the latter category is the continual confusion\nbetween lesbianism and feminism—at least insofar as I\nunderstand their concepts and practices.  Lesbianism\nhas to do with women being sexually involved with\nother women; I don't really much care what people do\nwith each other sexually—whether they are men or\nwomen—as long as they don't interfere with the sexual\npursuits or inclinations of others.  Feminism, as I\nunderstand it, is something entirely different, being a\nmatter of moral and civil right; that many who\nespouse feminism are also lesbians may be unfortunate\nfor The Cause and has given it a somewhat warped\nperspective and aspect.  There are, of course, other\naspects to feminism—psychological, linguistic, sociological,\netc.—and <em>A Feminist Dictionary</em> treats them\nall.  What is objectionable about it, and what sets it\napart from what most people expect from a dictionary\nor other reference work is its proselytizing, strident\ntone: the reader gets the feeling that the book is\nscreaming at him.</p>\n<p>As for the pronoun of reference <em>(him)</em> in the preceding\nsentence, it is the epicene one; on the other\nhand, there may be few women (and no feminists)\nwho would react with the same measure of revulsion\nas a man to the tone of the book.</p>\n<p>Looking at the book from an entirely different\npoint of view—that is, not as a dictionary but as a collection\nof statements on the many topics it covers—it\nmust be said to be an extremely useful documentation\nof the views of feminists on those topics, which range\nfrom <em>A, abbess</em>, and <em>Abominable Snowmen of Androcratic\nAcademia</em> through an incredible variety of\nentries that few people are likely to know enough\nabout to look up, to <em>zugassent</em> “Term used by George\nNoyes Miller (1845-1904) for the male continence program\npracticed at Oneida, New York, a utopian community\nin which members regularly analyzed sex roles\nand discussed their utopian visions of sex and class\nequality.”  Set into a framework provided by the editors/authors,\nthe “definitions” consist almost entirely\nof quotations, for which a full bibliography is provided\n(pp. 515-87).</p>\n<p>While it is conceivable that someone might look\nup entries like <em>pronoun</em> (and other language terms),\n<em>Ms, dike</em>, and some others, it seems less likely that a\nuser might expect to think of or encounter <em>PMZ</em> (“Post\nmenopausal zest.”), <em>quilting</em>, or <em>Grandmother Turtle</em>.\nThus, the book may be regarded as a series of short\nand long items that are to be read as such: it is only a\nbit peculiar to encounter such matter in alphabetical\norder.  As documentation, <em>A Feminist Dictionary</em>\nrecords an enormous amount of information in a relatively\nsmall compass.  Occasionally, that information is\na bit distorted, though it is not easy to tell to what\npurpose.  For example, the entry on <em>Random House\nDictionary</em> reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Edited by Jess Stein (1967), was financed inhouse\nby a publishing corporation interested in\nprofit.  Though dictionary-making in the U.S. has\nalways been competitive and motivated by\neconomics as well as scholarship, the <em>Random\nHouse Dictionary</em> embodies some of the\nconsequences of purely commercial lexicography.\n(James Sledd 1972)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is not clear what these comments have to do with\nfeminism or even lexicography.  There may be some\ncomplimentary and some unkind things to be said\nabout the <em>RHD</em> and its treatment of issues that arouse\nfeminists to militant rage, but they are scarcely worthy\nof repetition out of the context of the subject at\nhand.  In defense of the <em>RHD</em> it must be acknowledged\nthat, whatever its shortcomings, it has a better reputation\nand has better withstood the test of time than its\ncritics.  There are few other seemingly gratuitous\nentries in the book, but they are in the minority.  All in\nall, viewed as a social document, <em>A Feminist Dictionary</em>\nis an outstanding piece of work that collects into\none convenient volume the cogent, intelligent comments\nof feminists alongside the irresponsible ravings\nof the lunatic fringe, all of which must (apparently) be\nregarded as representative of <em>feminism</em>.  As a dictionary,\n<em>per se</em>, it is a disaster, but only a minor one.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
