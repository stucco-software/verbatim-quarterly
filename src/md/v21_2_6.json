The word <em>boustrophedon</em> is used to describe inscriptions that run “as the <em>ox</em> ploughs” (left to right, then right to left, and back again). Despite the wide range of directional options, all writing systems have one thing in common: they are intended to be read in the direction they are written. Actually, there is one significant exception to this rule, a written language used in Japan called <em>kanbun</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Kanbun</em> \\?\\ \\?\\ is essentially Classical Chinese (<em>wényánwén \\?\\ \\?\\ \\?\\</em>) as read by Japanese scholars. It began as a decoding system in which the reader learned to read texts from China as though they were Japanese, and developed into a way of writing employed by Japanese themselves.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Kanbun</em> system, special punctuation enables the reader to convert phrases presented in Chinese order (usually subject-verb-object) to Japanese order (usually subject-object-verb), and to supply missing inflectional endings to produce something approximating Classical Japanese. For example, let us consider the phrase:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mandarin English translation</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>shào</em> young</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>nián</em> year</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>yì</em> easy</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>lăo</em> old</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>xué</em> study</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>nán</em> difficult</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>chéng</em> accomplish</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mandarin Chinese speaker from Beijing would read this from top to bottom (it may also be written left to right) as <em>shàonián yì lăo, xué nán chéng</em>, and understand it to mean something like “It is easy for a youth to grow old, but harder to complete one's studies.” Speakers of other dialects would pronounce the characters differently but would associate the same meaning with the sentence. A Mandarin speaker from Chengdu would say <em>săonián y\\?\\ nào, xüó nán cén</em>, while a Southern Min speaker from Amoy would say <em>siàoliân \\?\\ ló, hák lân sêng</em>.</p>\n<p>The Japanese speaker, educated in Kanbun would punctuate this sentence with the aid of the symbol:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Japanese pronunciation</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>shō</em></p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>nen</em></p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>yasu(ku)</em></p>\n<p>\\?\\</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>o(i)</em></p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>gaku</em></p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>gata(shi)</em></p>\n<p>\\?\\</p>\n<p>\\?\\ <em>na(ri)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The symbol indicates that the character above it is to be read after the following character. Parentheses indicate inflectional endings not found in Chinese, inferred by the Japanese reader. The text would thus be read <em>shōnen o(i) yasu(ku), gaku na(ri) gata(shi)</em>, which retains the meaning of the original, as much as any translation can.</p>\n<p>Note that some of the Japanese readings are very similar to the Chinese original: <em>shō, nen</em>, and <em>gaku</em> are etymologically related to <em>shào, nián</em> and <em>xué</em> (originally <em>gak</em>). On the other hand, the readings <em>o(i), yasu(ku), na(ri)</em> and <em>gata(shi)</em>, are unrelated to Chinese <em>lăo, yì, chéng</em>, and <em>nán</em>. Characters are either pronounced in a “Japanized” version of the Chinese (<em>on</em> reading), or else a synonymous Japanese word (<em>kun</em> reading) is read in place of the Chinese word. The choice of which reading to use for a specific character is determined by context.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, for additional clarity, <em>kanbun</em> writers will add the inflectional endings to the right of the line, using phonetic symbols called <em>katakana</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\\?\\ Shō</p>\n<p>\\?\\ nen</p>\n<p>\\?\\ yasu</p>\n<p>\\?\\ \\?\\</p>\n<p>\\?\\</p>\n<p>\\?\\</p>\n<p>\\?\\ gaku</p>\n<p>\\?\\ gata</p>\n<p>\\?\\ \\?\\</p>\n<p>\\?\\</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, to get from Chinese to Japanese word order, a simple transposition of two characters may not suffice. More complex reordering may be indicated through punctuation as well. A sequence of \\?\\ signs means that the text so marked is read in reverse order:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\\?\\ 1</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 5</p>\n<p>\\?\\ [Circles represent any character,</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 4 and numbers indicate</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 3 the order in which they are to be read.]</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 2</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the symbol, there are two other devices for indicating that characters are to be read out of sequence. First, the characters - <em>ichi</em>, “one” and=<em>ni</em>, “two” may be used:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\\?\\ 1</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 4</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 2</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 3</p>\n<p>\\?\\</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that these numbers may be used more than once in a long phrase:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\\?\\ 1</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 2</p>\n<p>\\?\\ [The first occurence of = follows the first occurence of -,</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 3 etc. That is, the application of</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 4 the reversals must be consecu-</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 8 tive, without overlapping or nesting.]</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 6</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 7</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In cases where reversals overlap, or nest, a second pair of characters is used, namely, \\?\\ <em>ue</em>, “up” and \\?\\ <em>shita</em>, “down.” Here are two examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\\?\\ 7 \\?\\ 8</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 1 \\?\\ 3</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 4 \\?\\ 1</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 2 \\?\\ 2</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 3 \\?\\ 6</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 5 \\?\\ 4</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 6 \\?\\ 5</p>\n<p>\\?\\ 8 \\?\\ 7</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In general, the reordering markers are easily understood; the main source of ambiguity relates to the choice of <em>on</em> or <em>kun</em> readings, and, if a <em>kun</em> reading has been selected, the choice of inflectional endings intended. Not surprisingly, this arcane system of reading contrary to written order takes years to learn and has fallen out of fashion in recent decades. While there are still many people who can read <em>kanbun</em> texts, very few can actually write them. In the nineteenth century, however, <em>kanbun</em> was still widely used, and it is interesting to note that some of the first European language instruction books written in Japan employ similar systems for “reading” English and other languages in Japanese!</p>",
