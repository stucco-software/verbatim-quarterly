I'm Adam (and other inconsequential verbal trivia)</h1>\n<p><em><span data-rel=\"author\">Sydney Abbey</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Ottawa, Canada</span></em></p>\n<p>Let's not jump at conclusions.  The above title is\nnot, repeat, <em>not</em> a palindrome, that prey of so\nmany word-butchers (word-botchers, spoonerized\nbird-watchers?).  No, it is an entirely new kind of\nword-botchery.  It is an example of what I call a\n“diliteral,” although professional linguists will probably\nthink of a better term.  One can easily imagine situations\nwhich could lead to the use of the following\nadditional examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Edited it.<br>\nHot shots.<br>\nHer washer was.<br>\nWas Ted wasted?<br>\nMark the remark, there.<br>\nSentry's entry.<br>\nAttendances at ten dances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We may now have entered an entirely new happy\nhunting ground for word-botchers—if someone else\nhasn't thought of it first.  Not having encountered such\nprior use in Borgmann's <em>Language on Vacation,</em>\nBrandreth's <em>Joy of Lex</em> or his <em>More Joy of Lex,</em> nor in\nany other readings, I trus I can claim criginality.</p>\n<p>Now, let us broaden our horizons by going beyond\nthe bounds of English.  Here I must give credit to van\nRooten's <em>Mot d'Heures: Gousses, Rames</em> and to\nHulmes's <em>Morder Guss Reims</em> for inspiration, but not\nfor content.</p>\n<p>What, for example, has the French word <em>quatre</em>in\ncommon with the English word <em>strong?</em>  (In what follows,\nFrench words are followed by (F), English\nwords by (E).)  Well, <em>quatre</em> (F) = <em>four</em> (E), which in\nturn, sound like <em>fort</em> (F), which, of course, equals\n'strong' (E).  Other examples follow:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>repas (F) = meal (E) / mille (F) = thousand (E)<br>\ndit (F) = says (E) / seize (F) = sixteen (E)<br>\ncoulait (F) = sank (E) / cinq (F) = five (E)<br>\nblé (F) = wheat (E) / huit (F) = eight (E)<br>\nminerai (F) = ore (E) / or (F) = gold (E)<br>\npoirier (F) = pear tree (E) / perdrix (F) = partridge (E)<br>\nsyndicat (F) = trade union (E) / trait d'union\n(F) = hyphen (E)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to some analysts, that is how the partridge\nhappened to be in a pear tree for those\nTwelve Days.</p>\n<p>I cannot think of a good name for these bilingual\nphenomena, but let's look at them from a somewhat\ndifferent angle.  The two middle words in the above\nexamples depend on homophony.  How about trying a\nsimilar exercise with homography?</p>\n<p>This time, we might well ask what <em>quatre</em> (F) has in\ncommon with <em>oven</em> (E).  The answer is, using the notation\nas above, <em>quatre</em> (F) = <em>four</em> (E) / <em>four</em> (F) = <em>oven</em>\n(E).  Here are a few more examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>verser (F) = pour (E) / pour (F) = for (E)<br>\ndouleur (F) = pain (E) / pain (F) = bread (E)<br>\nprincipal (F) = main (E) / main (F) = hand (E)<br>\nsou (F) = cent (E) / cent (F) = hundred (E)<br>\ncréche (F) = manger (E) / manger (F) = eat (E)<br>\nle (F) = the (E) / thé (F) = tea (E)<br>\nemplacement (F) = location (E) / location (F) =\nrental (E)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Several of the foregoing comparisons involve what\nthe French call <em>les faux amis.</em>  A “better” example of\nthat translation pitfall may be found in the sad case of\nthe three kittens who fell into deep water while skating\non thin ice—i.e., “un, deux, trois cats sank.”\nAnother version might be “un de trois cats sank,” but\nFrench purists might object to that one.  Perhaps we\nshall never know whether all three kittens drowned,\nor only one of them.</p>\n<p>A little thought might well reveal further examples\nof all the foregoing useless information.  Similar cases\nare likely discernible in other bilingual combinations—I\njust happen to know English and French better\nthan any other two tongues.  French, being one of\nthe languages in which pronunciation is not consistently\nreflected in spelling (and vice versa), lends itself\nreadily to punning.  An example?  (You asked for it!):\n“J'ai soixante-neuf ans, mais quelquefois je me trouve\ncent-vingt [read 'sans vin'].”</p>\n<p>But let us glance into the fertile, if less familiar field\nof other languages.  Consider <em>beer, biére, bier, birra.</em>\nIf English, French, German, and Italian can have\nsuch similar words for that beverage, why must Spanish\nuse <em>cerveza?</em>  Other cases: How come that the Japanese\nexpression for “good morning” sounds very\nmuch like the name of an industrial mid-western\nstate?  How come that the Italian expression of “My\nGod” sounds much like the Hebrew “Who knows?”?\n(Imagine an Orthodox Italian Jew intoning “Who\nknows my God?”!) How come that the Russian word\nfor 'shape, form,' when rendered in cursive script,\nlooks identical to English “bug”?  Looking at it from\nanother angle, how does it happen that a man who\nwould refer to himself as <em>Deutsch</em> is called <em>German</em> by\nthe English, <em>Allemand</em> by the French, <em>Tedesco</em> by the\nItalians, and something like <em>Nemyenetz</em> by the Russians?</p>\n<p>Yes, playing around with language(s) can be fascinating,\nat least amusing.  It would be interesting to see\nmore of such material in the pages of VERBATIM.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
