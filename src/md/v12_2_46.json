Shipley, (The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London, 1984), xxxiii + 636 pp.</p>\n<p>In VERBATIM IX, No. 1, Summer 1982, p. 13, I was\nobliged to spend sixteen tiresome lines on Shipley's <em>Dictionary\nof Word Origins</em> (1945), then reprinted.  As if that wasn't\nburden enough, America's Oldest University Press (founded\n1878: napping in senility?) has now wished on us a far more\npricey enormity.</p>\n<p>This book is beyond belief.</p>\n<p>Pages 453-636 comprise simply a 2-columned Index of\nEnglish Words.  Index to what?  To the alphabetized morass\n(1-451) of so called “roots” under which is found the most\namazing midden of italicized words and isolated syllables\n(apparently meant to be Indo-European reconstructions)\nand unrelated dates and uncommented citations and barely\nrelevant anecdotes and accumulated junk that defies\nclassification.</p>\n<p>At first I was affronted on opening the book by the\nabsence of accents and length marks on the cited linguistic\nforms.  Then I realized it really didn't matter.  Let's follow\nShipley-type logic: look up <em>matter</em>—one reference is ma II.\nThis is said to be “imitative of a baby's cry, or noise when\nsuckling.”  (I suppose we may agree to this under the condition\nthat all suckling noises contain a Roman II.)  Here we\nfind Greek <em>meter</em> (no diacritics), as well as Dirac's <em>antimatter</em>,\nRoman <em>Maia, mammoth, mamma, mammals</em>, and\n<em>Mammillaria</em>, a genus of cacti with “nipples.”  Nowhere do\nwe find out HOW these get derived and related.</p>\n<p>Let's move on to the entry peter, which we are told\nmeans 'father.'  I thought at first a typesetter had missed his\naim at a schwa in the first syllable and then a proofreader\nhad nodded.  But we soon see that's too high-grade an error\nfor this remarkable dungheap.  For we immediately learn\nwhat should raise headlines in Athens: the Greek word is\n<em>peter</em> (goes with <em>meter</em> like his and hers, I guess).  After that\ncomes Latin and English (yep) <em>pater</em>.  If you aren't already\ndown for the count, note that “Roman <em>Jupiter</em> is a blend of\nGk <em>Zeus-peter</em>.”  Then you can go on to such moonshine as\nGk <em>petros, petroleum</em>, and “Step on the gas!”</p>\n<p>I think I've already taken enough of your time.  Don't\nlet them take any of your money.</p>\n<p><em>[Eric P. Hamp, The University of Chicago]</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
