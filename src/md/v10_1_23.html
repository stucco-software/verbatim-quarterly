<p>Consulting a bilingual dictionary, all of us have doubtless
had the experience of choosing the wrong translation of a
given English word.  Looking up the word <em>ball</em> for instance, the
student is likely to find several French equivalents, but unless
he also checks the French-English section (or better, a <em>Petit
Larousse</em>), he may not know that <em>un bal</em> is 'a dancing party,'
<em>une balle</em> 'a tennis or golf ball' (as well as baseball, cricket or
hockey ball, and bullet), <em>un ballon</em> 'a football,' <em>une bille</em> 'a
billiard ball' (or ball bearing or marble), and <em>une boule</em> 'a
croquet or bowling ball' not to forget <em>boulet</em> 'cannon ball,'
<em>boulette</em> 'meatball,' <em>pelote</em> or <em>peloton</em> 'ball of string,' and <em>couille</em>
'testicle.'  Translating into one's own language is of course less
difficult, but the context may not always indicate whether to
render <em>esprit</em> as 'spirit,' 'ghost,' 'inspiration,' 'mind,' or 'wit.'</p>
<p>A university colleague of mine, upon receiving a Christmas
greeting from a Chilean student that ended with the pious
phrase “May the Lord bless and can you,” easily surmised that
the lad must simply have taken the first dictionary meaning of
Spanish <em>preservar</em> 'to can, preserve.'  A French teacher, correcting
a student's composition, was puzzled by the expression
<em>plateau de frˆne</em>, until it occurred to her that he had probably
looked up <em>ashtray</em> as two words in the dictionary, then put
them together.  Some English schoolboy was responsible for
interpreting Cibber's <em>Love's Last Shift</em> as <em>La dernière chemise
de l'amour</em>, another for translating Shakespeare's “Out, out,
brief candle” as <em>“Sortez, courte chandelle</em>.”  When Chateau-briand
began putting Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em> into French, he
came to the lines “Siloa's brook that flow'd/Fast by the oracle
of God,” and translated <em>fast</em> as <em>rapidement</em>.  In a French
magazine article devoted to the early works of Daniel Chester
French, a picture of his Minuteman statue was labeled <em>Le Petit
Homme</em>.  In the French adaptation of Terence Rattigan's amusing
<em>French Without Tears</em>, a character asks how one would
translate “Red designs on China” and gets the reply, “<em>Eh bien,
des motifs en rouge sur la porcelaine</em>.”  A keen-eyed proofreader
on an American newspaper wondered why a bomber should be
christened <em>Shadow Theory</em>, and discovered that the reporter
had misheard the real name, <em>Château Thierry</em>.  Such blunders
corroborate the observation of Maimonides that the translator
must know three things: the genius of the language from which
he translates, the genius of the language into which he
translates, and the subject matter.</p>
<p>American travelers have not generally excelled in their
command of foreign languages.  One, bound for Paris, was
asked if he understood French, and replied, “I do, when I
speak it myself.”  On his return he was asked whether he had
had any difficulty with the language while in France, and
answered, “No, but the French did.”  When the Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, James Reynolds, was about to leave
for a trade conference in Paris, he assured Senator Root that he
spoke enough French to make waiters and cab drivers understand;
whereupon the Senator wondered aloud, “Suppose there
should be no waiters and cab drivers at the conference?”  An
American couple dining in a French restaurant, impressed by
their French-speaking companion, failed to understand that he
was instructing the waiter to give the check to the monolingual
husband.  And in the ladies' room, when the wife tried the
water tap marked C she got scalding-hot water for of course
the C stood for <em>chaud</em> rather than the expected “cold.”  Any
traveler who hasn't learned to think in the host language is
likely to find himself translating word by word, as did the
American who, seeing his bus rapidly disappearing down the
street without him, made a wild effort to translate “I am left
behind!”  by shouting, “<em>Je suis gauche derrière!</em>”</p>
<p>Two of my favorite stories concern Americans traveling
with a paucity of linguistic luggage.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, visiting Paris, passed by a church where a
wedding was taking place, and approaching a policeman, asked
who was getting married.  <em>“Je ne sais pas,”</em> replied the <em>flic</em>.  The
next morning the visitor, passing by the same church, noticed
that a funeral was in progress and stopped a woman to ask who
had died.  <em>“Je ne sais pas,”</em> she responded.  “Well!” exclaimed
Mr. Smith, “he didn't last long, did he?”</p>
<p>Mr. Goldberg registered at a French <em>pension</em> and went in
to his first dinner.  Presently he was joined at his table by a
Frenchman who, before sitting down, bowed politely and said,
<em>“Bon appétit.”</em> With equal formality Mr. Goldberg rose, bowed,
and said “Goldberg.”  This ceremony was repeated at each
meal for a couple of days, until Mr. Goldberg consulted an
acquaintance in the lounge, explaining how “the Frenchman
tells me his name Bon Appétit and I tell him mine 
Goldberg; but why keep it up day after day?”  “Oh, you don't
understand, Mr. Goldberg,” was the reply, “<em>Bon appétit</em> isn't
his name; it means 'I hope you have a pleasant meal.' ”  Mr.
Goldberg thanked his friend, and arriving late for dinner,
found the Frenchman already at the table.  Before sitting down,
Mr. Goldberg bowed formally and said, <em>“Bon appétit.”</em>  The
Frenchman rose, smiled, and murmured, “Goldberg.”</p>
<p>So, in the land where, as someone has said, one man's fish
is another man's <em>poisson</em>, the French make similar errors when
venturing into English.  A French tycoon, addressing a group of
American journalists, was asked what detail of American life
had made the greatest impression on him.  Wishing to be
gallant, he replied, “The ladies' toilets”; and it took the
journalists a while to realize that he was merely pronouncing in
English the word <em>toilettes</em> in the sense of 'dresses.'  Another
Frenchman sought to attract the attention of a shapely English
girl by exclaiming, “Oh, what a beautiful corpse!”  A Belgian
manufacturer, wanting to advertise his wares in English newspapers
as highly durable, translated the French word <em>inusable</em>
as 'unusable.'  And in a military bulletin in World War II, a
similar and potentially serious error was made by confusing
<em>des villages inhabités</em> and 'inhabited villages.'</p>
<p>Still another story has the Macmillans lunching with the
de Gaulles in Paris.  Mrs. Macmillan asks Mme. de Gaulle, in
English, “What are you looking forward to now?”  Mme. de
Gaulle replies simply, “A penis.”  A chill falls upon the table,
until the silence is broken by M. de Gaulle saying softly to his
wife, “My dear, I don't think the English pronounce the word
quite like that.  It's not 'a penis' but “appiness.' ”</p>
<p>Imagination often leads the translator astray.  One recalls
the irrepressible Hyman Kaplan, who explained to his night-school
class that the “R.S.V.P.” he'd tacked onto his composition
meant “Reply, vill you plizz?”  Another youthful American
defined <em>mal de mer</em> as a French expression meaning 'mother-in-law,'
and his girl friend thought a <em>tête-à-tête</em> was a 'doubleheader.'</p>
<p>During the Korean war, a comedian on a USO tour was
addressing an audience of Korean soldiers who did not understand
English, so a Korean officer volunteered to translate his
jokes into Korean.  After each joke, the Korean spoke into the
microphone and the audience collapsed in laughter.  The whole
routine was a howling success, and afterwards the comedian
thanked the Korean for translating his jokes so successfully.
“Sorry,” said the officer, “but I wasn't translating; you talked
so fast I couldn't follow you.”  “But what were you saying into
the mike?”  With a sly grin, the Korean replied, “I was telling
some jokes of my own.”</p>
<p>An American technician employed in a Russian plant
received a distressing wire from home about his only daughter:
“Harriet hung for juvenile crimes.”  He discovered that the
telegram had been translated into Russian, then retranslated
into English the original message had been “Harriet suspended
for minor offenses.”  Someone else had the idea of
testing a computer by having it translate an English phrase into
Russian and then back into English.  He fed in the English
maxim, “Out of sight, out of mind,” and a moment later got
back “Invisible insanity.”</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson insisted that a man should not “let
himself down” by speaking a foreign language imperfectly, and
so spoke only Latin when he was in Paris.  The rest of us do our
best with the native tongue.  When my wife and I were living
in Paris, we spent an enjoyable evening in a French home
where only French was spoken.  Reminiscing about the past,
my wife meant to say, <em>“Je suis née à Cleveland,”</em> but it came
out *“Je suis nue à Cleveland”* which brought to my mind an
earlier occasion when I had referred to a middle-aged man as
<em>“Un homme du moyen âge.”</em></p>
<p>In conducting 30 tour groups through 60-odd countries
around the world, I have enjoyed the services of many local
guides, most of whom spoke commendably good English.
However, even the best of them were likely to slip up
occasionally, and as a language teacher I was interested in the
kind of mistakes they made.  In the Holy Land the guides
frequently referred to the “seplucher”; in Cairo they must
have been influenced by Arabic verb tenses when they
informed us that “in Egypt it is very seldom raining.”  In
Kashmir, riding ponies up a mountain trail to Gulmarg, we
halted to let a train of porters pass down; after watching four
men plod past carrying a woman on a litter, my guide said in a
low voice, “That's for inválid old ladies.”  Our Russian guides
handled English very well, but I decided that they must all use
the same textbook, after noting, in the course of ten tours over
the years, that they consistently referred to public figures as
having “perished” rather than “died”; and one guide in
Leningrad must have wondered why the group laughed when
he described the dome of St. Isaac's Cathedral as “the third-largest
erection in the world.”</p>
