On the evidence of the examples\nquoted, I also wonder whether it is necessary to\nconstruct an artificial sublanguage out of the garbled\nforms that inevitably arise when a language is\nused by lazy, slipshod, and semi-literate speakers.\nThese forms are not restricted to America, they\ncome into being wherever English is used—or\nrather abused—as some of the following comments\nwill show.</p>\n<p>Not far from where I grew up in the English\nMidlands there were villages in which “air” sounds\nwere regularly replaced by “err.”  A local preacher\nwho came to our chapel greatly amused us by describing\nthe encounter of a prophet with a “burr,” a\nword that kept recurring in his sermon.

More intriguing is “meowk” for\n<em>milk</em>.  In the Bernese dialect of Swiss-German, the <em>l</em> is\nreplaced by a rather indistinct <em>u</em> sound, so that the\nGerman <em>Milch</em> becomes <em>Miuch</em> (with “ch” as in\n“loch”).  About the nearest American equivalent\nwould be “meowk,” so it would be interesting to\nascertain whether Bernese farmers might not have\nsettled in Georgia at some time.</p>\n<p>Garblings and imbroglios are going on all the\ntime in English, not only in America or in Slurvian\nbut wherever the lingo is spoken.  This reminds me\nof the worst pun I ever heard.  I was sitting with a\nfriend in a restaurant when he noticed another\nfriend at the far end of the room.  He wanted to convey\na message to him, and as there was too much\nbackground noise to do so by shouting, he tried to\nmouth his message.  But the other failed to get the\ngist of it.  After he had tried three times in vain, I\nsuggested in my usual helpful way: “Why don't you\ntry it in Hindustani?”  My friend shook his head and\nreplied: “He wouldn't Hindustanit if I did.”</p>\n<p><em>[Stanley Mason, Effretikon, Switzerland]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
