Others have a miniature\npoodle that for years has appeared in their “Season's\nGreetings” family pictures as <em>Shana Maydellah</em> [<em>sheyne\nmeydele</em> 'pretty little girl'].  I was not unprepared when a\ncanine puppet on TV's <em>Sesame Street</em> was called <em>Farfel</em> 'bits of\nnoodle' or when race horses were discovered with playful\nYiddish tags.  According to the <em>Jewish Digest</em>, a horse that ran\nin 1967 was <em>Nisht Amool</em> [<em>nisht a mol</em> 'not sometime'ânow!].\nIn at least one case a vulgar appellationâ<em>Alter Kocker [Alter\nKaker</em> 'Old Crapper,' commonly euphemized bilingually as\n<em>A.K.</em> or (since about 1960) “Alter Coyote”âcaused disqualification\nof the nag until his name was changed.</p>\n<p>Boats, too, have been treated to Yiddish monickers.  There\nwas in 1970 (and may still be) in Black Rock Harbor off\nBridgeport, Connecticut, a boat named <em>Mahia [mechaye</em> 'pleasure']\nand another (owned by a Gentile), <em>L'Chayim</em> 'To Life.'</p>\n<p>On other levels, announcers on WWDB FM radio in\nPhiladelphia have given billing to a psychologist as “Murray\nNeedelman with his hour of <em>tsuris</em> [var. of <em>tsores</em> 'troubles']”;\nand New York Republican Paul Slotkin in his campaign for\nCongress used the slogan “Don't Plotz [<em>plats</em> 'explode'], Vote\nSlots.”  In further bilingual fun, Lucille Ball on an old Jack\nBenny TV show (rerun Sept. 24, 1981) dubbed lumbering John\nWayne “El Klutzo” [<em>kluhts</em>, var. of <em>klots</em> 'log'].  Abigail van\nBuren in 1980 referred to the man who sorts her Dear Abby\nmail as her “faithful Jewish 'schleppercaun' ” [<em>shlepper</em> 'lugger,\ntramp'].</p>\n<p>As we're told in the McDavid edition of Mencken's <em>The\nAmerican Language</em> (1963), a Chinese Noshery [<em>nasheray</em>\n'snackables'] was established c. 1955 in the nation's capital.\nWhat do you suppose the New York catering service specializing\nin kosher Chinese food is named?  Shang-Chail In Philadelphia\na restaurant offering kosher Italian cuisine is (what else?)\nThe Kosher Noshtra.  (These are reminiscent of the joke\nrecently quoted in VERBATIM about the mixture of Manischewitz\nwine and tomato juice, an “Oyvay [<em>oy vey</em> 'woe is\nme'] Maria.”  Last year I met a woman from an Italian Catholic\nfamily who is married to a Jew; she told me, “He's a <em>Litvak</em>\n[Jew of Lithuanian origin], and I'm a Litwop.”)</p>\n<p>In the twenties and thirties, Jewish high-school students\nused to clown around with nonsense French and Yiddish:\n“Chevrolet coupe,/ a vu tut dir vey?  [.../'where does it hurt\nyou?'].”  Today, as mature adults, such persons have been heard\nto comment tolerantly, “Chacun à son mishugas ['wackiness']”\nor to exclaim critically, “Quel chutzpa [<em>chutspe</em> 'gall']!” or to\ninquire smilingly of a new acquaintance, “Qu'est-ce que c'est\ndayn chazer'she ['your filthy'âlit., 'swinish'] business?”  There's\nof course a New York eatery named Bagel Delox, and it may be\npertinent that Mimi Sheraton, food critic of <em>The New York\nTimes</em>, on Aug. 31, 1976 described the service at most bagel\nrestaurants in New York as “haute schlock” [<em>shlak</em> 'stroke,'\nhence 'disaster,' 'junk'; <em>schlacht</em> 'slaughter'; <em>shlogn</em> 'to hit']â\nwithout quotation marks or italics.</p>\n<p>The students who used to spoof Spanish with Yiddishâin\n“Vi est a qui una mesa?”  [<em>Vi est a ki</em> (var. of <em>ku) on a meser?</em>\n'How does a cow eat without a knife?']ânow quip about the\nMexican woman who serves her Jewish husband “enchilatkes”\n[<em>latkes</em> 'pancakes'].  Moreover, the old Latin-Yiddish conjugation\n<em>amo, amas, amat, a mames, a tates, a kind</em> '...a mother's and\nfather's child' has been followed by modern twists on Latin,\nlike the line from a wag in my family about the girl who checks\nher suitor's astrological sign and finds that it is <em>Tsores</em>.  (Interestingly\nenough, a Latin-Yiddish term appears in American black\nslang: <em>mater mazuma [mezumen</em> 'ready cash'] 'female college\nteacher,' reported in 1970 from southern black college student\nuse of the 1940s.)</p>\n<p>Reportedly, Jewish residents of Hawaii have been known\nto welcome visitors with “Alohaleichem” [<em>aloha</em> combined with\nthe greeting <em>sholem aleichem</em> 'peace be with you'].  And comic\nstrips have shown bilingually named personalities like the\nplastic surgeon Dr. Poonim [<em>punim</em>, var. of <em>ponim</em> 'face'], the\nmatchmaking mother Ma Zeltov [<em>mazel tov</em> 'good luck, congratulations'],\nand various others.</p>\n<p>Especially fascinating have been the word-playing antics\nin Sid Caesar's TV skits over the years.  Witness his Japanese\ncharacters <em>Gantse Mishpūchah [gantse mishpuche</em> (var. of\n<em>mishpoche)</em> 'whole clan']; <em>Taka Mitziah [takeh, matsie\\?\\ 'really,</em> 'really,\nbargain'; presumably a further play on the name of Japanese\ncomposer Takemitsu]; <em>Shmatsay [shmatte</em> 'rag']; or Princess\n<em>Tushy Tushy</em> [bilingual children's diminutive (recorded in 1962\nas <em>tushie</em>), from <em>tuchas</em>, var. of <em>toches</em> 'rump,' these being\nsources of English <em>tochas, tuchas, tuckis, tookis, tukis</em> (and the\ncomment <em>tough tukis</em> 'tough luck,' dating to the 1960s), <em>tokis,\ntokus, dokus</em>, and possibly of both the underworld term for a\n'lifer,' <em>tocker</em> (he sits on his rump), and the British terms for\n'administering or receiving a thrashing,' <em>give</em> (or <em>get</em> or <em>catch)</em>\n<em>toco or toks</em>].  Author Sol Weinstein, in his parodies of mystery\nfiction, probably paved the way for Caesar's writers with his\nwar between Israel and TUSHâthe Terrorist Union for Suppressing\nHebrews!</p>\n<p>It may not be too surprising that a Miss Tushy beauty\ncontest was mentioned in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> May 31, 1982,\nas a project of a bar near the L. A. airport, or that syndicated\ncolumnist Earl Wilson on April 16, 1982, concluded his\nremarks on the shapeliness of Pia Zadora with these words:\n“Indeed, said the photographer, Pia's derriere will out-tushy\nBardot's.”  Most striking is the annual Miss Tush of the Year\npageant, inaugurated in 1979 by a California women's apparel\nshop with outlets in Hermosa Beach and San Pedro.  The name\nof the shop?  The Tushery!</p>\n<p>The colorful alphabetical expressions of Jewish Americans,\nfirst recorded in the 1940s, persist and grow.  Although these\nhave included alphabetizing of English (M.O.T. 'Member of the\nTribe' and the more recent <em>J.A.P.</em> 'Jewish American Princess'â\nthe latter the cause of a brouhaha this year at a midwestern\nuniversity), they are more often Roman letters for Yiddish\nexpressions, as in the aforementioned <em>A.K.</em> or the old <em>T.O.T.</em>\n'cash on the line' [<em>Toches Oyfn Tish</em> 'Arse on the Table'] and\n<em>T.L. [Toches Leker</em> 'Arse Licker'], which (as recorded in 1970)\nhas bred <em>T.L.er</em> and <em>T.L.ing</em>.  Other forms of the past twenty\nyears or so (also recorded in 1970) are the bilingual play on the\npharmacy degree <em>Ph. G.: Papa Hot Gelt</em> 'The father has money'\nand on <em>A.M.: Able Mamzer</em> ['bastard'].</p>\n<p>What a boost Yiddish has given to commercial enterprise!\nIt has shown up in the names of various food emporiums:\n<em>Eppes Essen</em> 'Something to Eat' delicatessens in Indiana,\nFlorida, and elsewhere; a <em>Ye Noshery</em> hotel snack bar in Florida\nand a <em>Nosh Bar</em> delicatessen in London; <em>Bagel Mavin [meyvn</em>\n'connoisseur'] and <em>Bagel Nosh</em> restaurants in New York; the\n<em>Mavins New York Scene Restaurant and Deli</em> in San Diego, etc.\nIt has also spiced up food-product names like <em>Ba Tampte\n[batamte</em> 'tasty'] <em>Pickles; Tam Tam</em> [Flavor Flavor] crackers;\n<em>Noshies</em>, a Japanese (!) type of snack by Tem Tee; and so on.</p>\n<p>Other products capitalizing on Yiddish have ranged from\nthe <em>Nebbish</em> 'Poor Fool' gift items and the <em>Bupkis [buhpkes,</em>\nvar. of <em>bopkes</em> 'beans,' 'trifle'] Family of zany dolls, to\nimprinted aprons (“Any shnook [<em>shnukel</em> 'sap'; <em>shnuk</em> 'trunk,\nsnout'] can cook”) and shopping bags (“Schlep!,” “Son of\nSchlep,” and “Super-Schlep”), to the Remco game called <em>Shmo</em>\n[supposed euphemism for vulgar <em>shmok</em> 'prick,' source of\n<em>shmuck</em> and <em>shmucky</em> (increasingly used without awareness of\ntheir vulgarity) and probably of the low-level British forms\n<em>shmook, schmock, smock</em>, and (anti-Semitic) <em>shmog</em> and\n<em>smoggy</em>].  Not only has there been a board game by Parker\nBros. named <em>Plotz!;</em> but a card game by Originals Only Co. is\nnamed <em>O. Shlemiel</em> ['Lummox']; and a widely selling ladies'\npanty-liner from Poirette Corsets, Inc., is dubbed <em>Gotke [gatke</em>\n'drawer'].</p>\n<p>Bemusing, too, is the variety of entrepreneurs that have\ntaken advantage of Yiddish in their business titles.  Two seem to\nhave built on a Sid Caesar joke mentioned earlier: <em>Mitsia\nMotors</em>, a Toyota dealer on Long Island, and <em>Takamitziah</em>, a\nNew York resort hotel with Japanese architecture and a\nSamurai lounge (!).  Among many others, there are the <em>Lewis\nImaginative Ippsy-Pippsy Photographers</em> in Los Angeles; <em>Rent-a-Kvetch\n[kvetsh</em> 'whiner'], Inc., a New York firm handling\nconsumer complaints; the <em>Chutzpah [sic]</em> Phone Service in a\nnumber of cities, making challenging calls on assignment; as\nwell as authors and publishers of such volumes as the <em>Organic\nYenta [yente</em> 'gossip'] <em>Cook Book</em> and the <em>Book of Buffs,\nMasters, Mavens [sic] and Uncommon Experts</em>.</p>\n<p>As several writers have observed, science fiction seems\nparticularly hospitable to Yiddish word-play.  Corrupt cops on a\ntransgalactic planet, for example, are <em>Ganavim [ganeyvim</em>, pl.\nof <em>ganef</em> 'crook']; interplanetary visitors to Venus who look like\nlittle brown pillows with tentacles are <em>Bulbas [bulbe</em> 'potato']; a\ncharacter named <em>Milchik</em> ['dairy' adjective relating to dietary\nlaws] has an uncle named <em>Fleischik [fleyshik</em> 'meat,' adj.], etc.</p>\n<p>Other fiction, as well as political cartoons, greeting cards,\nmovies, and stage productions have also utilized Yiddish.  One\nadoption that has surfaced in all these and other places is the\ndeprecating <em>shm-</em> phoneme (discussed by several authors in the\nfifties).  It became famous in the old quip, “Cancer, shmancer,\n<em>abi gezunt</em> ['as long as you're healthy']” and in the adjective\n<em>fancy-shmancy</em>.  Typical are such examples as the classic Herblock\ncartoon about the Atomic Energy Commission a generation\nago “Mutations, Shmutations, Long as You're Healthy”;\nthe dramatic ad of the oil industry in <em>The New York Times</em> Nov.\n25, 1979, concerning the windfall-profits tax, headed “Windfall-Schmindfall\n[<em>sic</em>],” to the tesselated puzzle recently produced\nby Professor Sam Savage of the University of Chicago, wryly\nnamed <em>Shmuzzles</em>.</p>\n<p>In direct translation, too, Yiddish has been exploited in the\nmarketplace and in various mediaâin several versions of “Wear\nit in good health” on Misty Harbor raincoat labels; in the\ndefiant question or exclamation “Who needs it?  (!)” in advertising\nof Union Oil Co. and Mutual of New York, among other\ncompanies; in the ironic “That's all I need” in radio commercials\nfor Bayer aspirin; in the versatile question “Where is it\nwritten that...,” etc.  Significant are the widely adopted\ntranslations that affectâbesides intonation as seen in the\nforegoingâsyntax and even meaning: “Hurt, it can't”; “What's\nwith him?”  [<em>What's with</em> for <em>What's the matter with</em>], “What's\nto argue?”  [<em>What's to for What is there to...about</em>]; “O.K. by\nme” [<em>by</em> for withârecorded in 1962]; “I don't want to know\nfrom...” [<em>know from</em> for <em>know or know about</em>ârecorded in\n1970âa usage established by the old translation “He don't\nknow from nothin',” recorded in 1943]; the ironic “Go know”\nand “Go figure” [<em>Go</em> for <em>How could I</em> or <em>Just try to</em>ârecorded\nin 1955]; the shrugging “I should worry” ['Why should I' or\n'I'm not about to'âfirst recorded as a Yiddishism in 1914]; the\ndestiny-invoking “You should be so lucky”âa headline in <em>Punch</em>\nDec. 17, 1980 [an expression recorded in 1962, its close\nrelative, “I should live so long,” having been recorded in 1943],\netc.</p>\n<p>Also seen and heard, of course, are jaunty bilingual\nadjectives like <em>shmaltzy</em> 'sentimental,' <em>shlumpy</em> 'slovenly,'\n<em>klutzy</em> 'awkward,' etc., and inventive bilingual verbs like <em>to\nhoo-ha</em> 'to make an issue' [<em>hu-ha</em>, n. 'to-do'; exclam.  'Oh boy!',\n'Fancy that!'], and others like the one a White House transcript\ncredited to President Nixon in 1972: <em>to get schnookered [sic]</em>, an\napparent combination of <em>shnook</em> and the pool term <em>snookered</em>.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, malapropisms abound.  Just two “for-instances”:\nthe confusion of Yiddish intensives in translation,\n<em>yet</em> and <em>already</em>, by the <em>Los Angeles Times'</em> travel editor Bruce\nHamby: “...I'm ready to cry, 'Enough, yet!' ” (March 25,\n1979); and the mistaking of <em>shmegeggi</em> [<em>shmegege</em> 'jackass'] for\n<em>shmear</em> by Jean Bach in a remark to Arlene Francis on New\nYork's WOR radio Dec. 24, 1979: “When I was a little girl I\nhad German...kuchen and the whole shmegeggi.”</p>\n<p>If we are not witnessing what the maverick psychology\nprofessor A. A. Roback predicted fifty years agoâa flooding of\nEnglish by Yiddishismsâwe are certainly seeing a high tide.\nAppropriate indeed would be a sail on each of those two\nConnecticut boats, <em>L'Chayim</em> and <em>Mahia</em>: i.e., we should live\n(and be well) and enjoy!</p>",
