What are your favorite words? What are the words you love to say, write, read, or sing? Send your nominations to VERBATIM: The Language Quarterly, 4907 N. Washtenaw Ave., Chicago, IL 60625, or check out our website at <em><a href=\"http://www.VERBATIMmag.com\">http://www.VERBATIMmag.com</a>.</em> Several entries selected at random will receive a new desk dictionary of the winner's choice. The UK's top ten words were: 1. <em>Serendipity</em> 2. <em>Quidditch</em> (from the Harry Potter books) 3. <em>Love</em> 4. <em>Peace</em>, <em>why</em> (tie) 5. <em>Onomatopoeia</em> 6. <em>Hope</em> 7. <em>Faith</em> 8. <em>Football</em>, <em>muggle</em>, <em>hello</em>, <em>family</em> (tie) 9. <em>Compassion</em>, <em>home</em> (tie) 10. <em>Jesus</em>, <em>money</em> (tie).</p>\n<p>There's more to the London Festival of Literature story at <em><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_930000/930319.stm\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_930000/930319.stm</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This call has been on our website for some time, and some favorite words have already been proposed, including <em>halcyon, lollapalooza, anthropomorphic, shinny, hella</em> (slang for 'very'), <em>isthmus, cicisbeo, forlorn, Shakespeare, flummox, ubiquitous, rainbow, language, fascination,  chimera, adrift, shibboleth, defile, and callipygian.</em> The last is an adjective meaning “having beautifully proportioned buttocks,” surely a favorite word for many reasons.</p>\n<p>I hope the above words inspire VERBATIM readers to send in favorite words by the bucketful.

I was fairly annoyed by the London Festival list; surely, I thought, no one thinks the word <em>love</em> is a lovely word on its phonetic merits, or on the shape of its letters alone?
