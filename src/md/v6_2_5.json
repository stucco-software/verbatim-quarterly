Nor do I have any quibble with using foreign phrases\nwhich are also <em>bona fide</em> members of scientific terminology.\nSo, I am not too disturbed by this sample: The <em>Exercises</em> tacitly\npresuppose, therefore, the metaphysical dynamics of the\nact of faith, wherein the <em>fides quae</em> is tasted and reveals its\nmeaning because of the <em>fides qua</em> in whose light it is seen.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b3\" id=\"user-content-fnref-b3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup>\nThis sentence from the article, however, is a mere <em>hors\nd'oeuvre</em> compared to the pièce de résistance, which immediately\nfollows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just as a person examining a psychological illustration\nof Figure/Ground perceives a changing Figure/\nGround before his eyes, during the consolation without\nprevious cause the specific Christian mystery becomes\nGround or horizon through transparency, and\nwhat was previously Ground or horizon (supernaturally-elevated\nand Christ-anointed transcendence) becomes\nFigure by directly dominating consciousness in\na quasi-intuitional felt-knowledge in which the exercitant\nbecomes pure openness and receptivity to his\nhomeward-tending love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I challenge any philological Rube Goldberg to diagram\nthat sentence!  I am sure that the author's meaning would\nhave been clearer in German, although that language doesn't\neven bother to use such humble device as slashes, hyphens,\nand spaces to produce verbal juggernauts.</p>\n<p>The article I have quoted deals partially with the classic\n<em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em>.  The author has succeeded in showing\nhow the smokescreen of jargon can wrap the “Cloud of\nUnknowing” with a “fog of unsaying.”</p>\n<p>I have engaged in the text-producing generation (writing)\nof this article, so that you, the text-processing analyst\n(reader), may protect yourself against the multiphasic bafflegab\nof cirumlocutory obfuscation.</p>\n<hr>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-b1\">\n<p>N.Y.
