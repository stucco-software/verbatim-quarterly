Yet, it must be known\nthat Professor Monnot has purloined my idea for which I have\nbeen gathering material these many months.  Worse still, the\nwretch has made a better job of it than I ever could!  In the\nphotograph he seems to be perched atop a slate roof, presumably\nbecause he expects the drinks to be on the house.</p>\n<p>It is unavoidable, one must assume, to prepare a collection\nof puns without explaining the nature of paronomasia.  Unfortunately,\nsuch explanations come off as badly as explaining puns,\nan exercise in which the author engages now and then, but\nchiefly to elucidate a context that might not be immediately\napparent to the reader.  Monnot has classified puns into five\nmain categories (Grammatical Ambiguity; Same Spelling, Same\nPronunciation; Different Spelling, Same Pronunciation; Same\nSpelling, Different Pronunciation; Different Spelling, Different\nPronunciation) and the inevitable Miscellaneous.</p>\n<p>As is to be expected, some (if not most) of the examples\ncited are rather corny and crude: it is almost as if the\ncopywriters who created the lines were told to come up with a\npun at the peril of their jobs.  Examples are</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arrow shirts [picture of Joe Namath sporting one]:</p>\n<p>“When Arrow made this shirt, it wasn't for any old\nJoe.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But—isn't the <em>real</em> point that it <em>was</em> for “any (old) Joe”?\nSome backfire:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Avis Rent-a-Car:</p>\n<p>“Ride Avis out of town.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm sure Hertz would love to.</p>\n<p>Some are apt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Baldwin pianos:</p>\n<p>“Rent a Baldwin for a song.”</p>\n<p>Bank of A. Levy:</p>\n<p>“Our interest in you is guaranteed.”</p>\n<p>Some are simply inappropriate:</p>\n<p>Burgess batteries:</p>\n<p>“Burgess batteries turn me on.”</p>\n<p>Burlington (Textile) Building in New York:</p>\n<p>“Burlington wants you to go through the Mill.”</p>\n<p>First National City Bank:</p>\n<p>“We work like elephants.  For peanuts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some are farfetched:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cannon towels:</p>\n<p>“Cannon puts it right on the line.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After some thought—about .001 seconds—I realized that the\nline is the clothesline.  Or the firing line?  Any other suggestions?\nIt is meaningless to me.  And is the following a pun?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Icelandic Airlines:</p>\n<p>“A world of difference.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This one relies on familiarity with an expression that is, I think,\nrather archaic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mumm Champagne:</p>\n<p>“It was marzipan, carols, candles, and Mumm was the\nword.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Besides, the expression is <em>Mum's the word</em> (that is, <em>is</em>).\nRecently, I have heard this revised to the present tense.  There\nare some that are simply in bad taste:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>American Hardware Mutual Insurance [picture of a\nwheelchair]:</p>\n<p>“You could get the chair for reckless driving.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why not “You could get a lower premium for wreckless\ndriving”?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>March of Dimes [picture of Arnold Palmer:</p>\n<p>“What's your handicap?”  (Tag line: “Birth defects are\nforever.”)</p>\n<p>Rugby:</p>\n<p>“It takes leather balls to play rugby.”</p>\n<p>SPCA:</p>\n<p>“Don't litter.  Neuter your pets.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The worse the distortion, the more painful the pun.  It\nseems that when the consonants of a word are distorted to\nforce a pun (Supp-hose socks: “Sock therapy”) the results are\n“better” than when the vowels are mangled (Ventura Luggage:\n“For gracious leaving”; Hill &amp; Hill Liquor: “Tell your boss to\ngo to Hill”).</p>\n<p>Other distortions almost demand explanations (for me, at least):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chris' and Pitt's [sauce]:</p>\n<p>“California's No. 1 grill friend.”</p>\n<p>Holiday Inn, Barstow, California:</p>\n<p>“Try our seafood.  Just for the halibut.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The last is supposed to be a pun on <em>Helluvit</em>, scarcely a good\nreason to try restaurant fare, I should think.)</p>\n<p>The most atrocious, appalling examples can be found in\nthe Miscellaneous category, where, apparently, anything goes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Noxema [<em>sic</em>] Shaving Cream:</p>\n<p>“Let Noxema [<em>sic</em>] cream your face so the razor won't.”</p>\n<p>Ewe's milk cheese:</p>\n<p>“It's Ewe-nique.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, advertisers rely heavily on arch, catchy copy to\ndraw the attention of readers.  Almost all of the examples\ncompiled by Monnot are from graphic sources; some that have\nbeen found in print also appear on television, and a few can be\nheard on radio.  Considering the much broader impact of\ntelevision and its greater audience, it is surprising that promotion\nof a paronomastic character hasn't yet penetrated that\nmedium to any great extent: perhaps advertisers (or their\nagencies) feel that the relatively low mental age of viewers, as\nset forth by the media statistics firms, precludes the intelligence\nrequired to understand puns.  On the other hand, I have seen\nmany children's shows and cartoons on television and offer the\nimpression that a large measure of the humor directed at\nchildren is based on word play.  Maybe children can understand\npuns better than their parents.</p>\n<p>My own collection of word play is drawn from department-store\nadvertising in, mainly, <em>The New York Times</em>.  Here is\na sampling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gloria Vanderbilt jeans:</p>\n<p>“New York Magazine says our bottoms are tops.”</p>\n<p>“New York Magazine we thank you from the bottom of\nour jeans.”  —<em>N.Y. Times</em>, August 26, 1981, p. 34.</p>\n<p>“put your best fit forward in Gloria's new jeans.”\n[Macy's advt.] —Ibid., p. 32.</p>\n<p>Clinique cosmetics [figures on chessboard]:</p>\n<p>“Saving face is the name of the game in this city.  It's\nyour move.”  [Macy's advt.] —Ibid., p. 4.</p>\n<p>Ralph Lauren:</p>\n<p>“Ralph Lauren.  He shows, once and for all, how the\nEast and the West are one.”  [Macy's advt.]  —Ibid.,\np. 15.</p>\n<p>NYSE shirts:</p>\n<p>“How fitting.  New York gets in shape: the new fitted\nsports shirt by NYSE.”  [Macy's advt.] —Ibid., p. 26.</p>\n<p>Continental Quilt Shoppe:</p>\n<p>“So...you think you've got it <em>made</em>....  The Continental\nQuilt literally <em>makes your bed!</em>” —Ibid., p. 30.</p>\n<p>Bloomingdale's:</p>\n<p>“The great coverup: 20% to 50% off sleepcovers and\nroll up blinds.” —Ibid., p. 38.</p>\n<p>Saks Fifth Avenue:</p>\n<p>“Express Yourself... to K.I.D.S. on 8!” [='the 8th\nfloor'] —Ibid., p. 41.</p>\n<p><em>New York Times</em> [picture of many kinds of balls]:</p>\n<p>“Have a ball with the Sports Pages of The New York\nTimes.” —Ibid., n.p.</p>\n<p>Henri Bendel [picture of 2 models, one pointing]:</p>\n<p>“The point is that Perry Ellis does clothes for dedicated\ncollectors.”  —Ibid., p. 52.</p>\n<p>UV Factors Corporation:</p>\n<p>“Raising Capital?  Don't plant in the heat of day.”</p>\n<p>—Ibid., Section 3, p. 2.</p>\n<p>CCS Communication Control, Inc. [anti-bugging\ndevice]:</p>\n<p>“Bugged?”  —Ibid., Section 5, p. 16.</p>\n<p>Okun Co. [patching compound]:</p>\n<p>“Don't Crack Up.”  —Ibid., p. 16.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If that isn't enough for one day's advertisements in <em>The New\nYork Times,</em> regard the following headlines in the same day's\npaper:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Star-Crossed At the Bolshoi.”  —Section 4, p. 1.</p>\n<p>“Rhodesian Theme: Guns Before Barter.”  —Ibid., p. 2.</p>\n<p>“Ivan Go Home, Says Nigeria.”  —Ibid.</p>\n<p>“Sauce for the Gander.”  [about a golfer who clubbed a Canada goose to death] —Ibid., p. 6.</p>\n<p>“State Fairs: The Pulse Slows in the Heartland.”</p>\n<p>—Section 3, p. 1.</p>\n<p>“Runaway Prices for Racehorses.”  —Ibid.—Ibid.</p>\n<p>“A Horse!  A Horse!  $1 Million for a Horse!”  —Ibid.,\np. 6.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We'd best keep on our toes, since something is obviously\nafoot....</p>\n<p>My only adverse comment about this book is about the\nprice: the text is not even typeset, and the production is, in\ngeneral, of rather low quality.  The hardbound edition might\nappeal to libraries, but ordinary mortals could be well satisfied\nwith the paperback edition.</p>\n<p>[Note: It might be difficult to find this book at your neighborhood\nbookshop, so orders should probably be sent to University\nPress of America, Inc., P.O. Box 19101, Washington, D.C.\n20036.]</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
