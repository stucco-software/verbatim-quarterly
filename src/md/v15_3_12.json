There are\nmany interesting entries in <em>Family Words</em> which, as far\nas I know, is the first documentation of the genre.\nThere are occasional hidden entries, as the list of diseases—among\nthem the <em>dread mohogus</em>—under the\nentry for <em>Fowlenzia</em>.  (In the VERBATIM family, some\nsuffer from <em>Fowler's pip</em>, an affliction affecting language\nfanatics who base a slavish purism on a literal\ninterpretation of <em>Modern English Usage</em>.)</p>\n<p><em>Family Words</em> is useful and fun.  Inevitably, some\nof the entries are more imaginative than others; Dickson\nwill have his hands full if everyone responds giving\nprivate words.  Please sent yours to the author, c/o Addison-Wesley,\nReading, MA 01867, not to VERBATIM.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
