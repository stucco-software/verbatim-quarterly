Sebastian</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Philadelphia</span></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...here will be an old abusing of God's patience\nand the king's English.</p>\n<p><em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em> (i.4.5-6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although Rex Harrison died over a year ago,\nsome of his fans still regret that, apart from\none try in <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>, he had never\ndone a Shakespearean comedy.  With what acerbic\nsuavity would he have retorted to Katherina's “...\nand so farewell,” with “What! with my tongue in\nyour tail?”  <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> (ii.1.217).  Indeed,\nShakespeare would have been delighted by a\nHarrison rendition of many of the more than a thousand\nnaughty passages that have so diligently been\ncompiled by Eric Partridge in his <em>Shakespeare's\nBawdry</em>.  Partridge's are all instances of intentionally\nnaughty entries.  But far more hilarious are those\nitems penned by the Bard that were never intended\nto shock or amuse a future evil-minded generation\nsuch as ours with indelicate, let alone indecent, suggestiveness,\nRex Harrison or no!</p>\n<p>In <em>Othello</em> (v.2.266), even the most unflappable\nreader must gasp at the Moor's offer to Gratiano:\n“Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,” nor\nwill his guffaws entirely abate after he learns that\n<em>butt</em> here means <em>goal</em>.  In <em>Twelfth Night</em> (v.1.126), it\nwould appear that Duke Orsino was not fully aware\nof what was befalling him when he admitted to\nOlivia that “I partly know the instrument that\nscrews me.”  In <em>Sonnets to Sundry Notes of Music</em>\n(I.15), we find the puzzling howler, “Then lullaby,\nthe learned man hath got the lady gay.”  <em>Gay</em> is used\nhere as a compliment, but today's jaded reader will\nsnicker at the line.  In <em>King Lear</em> (iii.3.15 et seq.),\none is comforted to note that the generous Gloucester\nis eager to become the wretched Lear's nurse's\naide, as he assures Edmund that “I will seek him and\nprivily relieve him...the king, my old master,\nmust be relieved.”  In <em>Macbeth</em> (v.3.54), your normally\nprurient theater-goer may well sense a hint of\nOnan when Macbeth orders the Doctor to “Pull't\noff, I say.”  In <em>Hamlet</em> (iv.7.85), the King seems to be\nhinting rather indelicately to Laertes that Lamord,\nthe Norman horseman, had beefed up a bit, when he\npicturesquely notes that “...he grew into his\nseat.”  Similarly, in <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> (i.3.31-33),\nNestor offers Agamemnon this flattering description\nof a monarch's royal behind:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With due observance of thy god-like seat,<br>\nGreat Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply<br>\nThy latest words.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And never mind that <em>seat</em> in both quotes means\nthrone.  In <em>King John</em> (ii.1.413-14), even the gentlest\nreader may be forgiven for wondering what in\nthe name of propriety is going on in the armies of\nAustria and France, when the Bastard informs King\nJohn that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From north to south<br>\nAustria and France shoot in each other's mouth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One should note another category made up of\nvarious terms and phrases that have a decidedly\nmodern flavor that is not quite what our playwright\nhad intended for them.  These are items that may\nraise the stiffest eyebrows, as in <em>Cymbeline</em>\n(iii.3.21-2), where the reader may infer that the\nmail service was just as deficient then as it is today,\nwhen Belarius gripes to his sons, Guiderius and Arvigarus,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>O! this life<br>\nIs nobler than attending for a check,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—or maybe the check was not even in the mail.</p>\n<p>Were Shakespeare writing today, he might have\nto revise some passages in order to avoid misunderstanding,\nas might be the case with Scarus's declaration\nto Antony in <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em> (iv.7.9-10)\nthat</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have yet<br>\nRoom for six scotches more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though Scarus's reference is to cuts or gashes, today's\nin genuous reader might well assume that\nScarus was preparing to go on a bender.  In the\nopening chorus of <em>King Henry V</em>, lines 11-12, there\nis asked</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>can this cockpit hold<br>\nThe vasty fields of France?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No anachronism here, of course, as <em>cockpit</em> refers,\nnot to a part of an airplane, but to an enclosed place\nfor fighting cocks and, in a transferred sense, to a\ncircular theater.  When Katharina tells Petruchio in\n<em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> (iii.2.214) “You may be jogging\nwhiles your boots are green,” she was referring\nto transportation by horse and not to our current\nphysical fitness mania.  And the “puke-stocking”\nmentioned by Prince Henry in <em>1 Henry IV</em>\n(ii.4.79-80) is not a reference to the hosiery worn\nby our kind of jogger, but to a dark woolen cloth.  Is\nthere a more up-to-date cliché than tender loving\ncare?  In 2 Henry VI (iii.2.279-80), the king issues\nthe command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me,<br>\nI thank them for their tender loving care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here are some other noteworthy current terms\nused by Shakespeare:</p>\n<p><em>good brother</em> — this expression of common present\nusage is found in <em>Julius Caesar</em> (iv.3.236) where,\nafter Cassius had bidden him good-night, Brutus\nreplies, “Good-night, good brother.”</p>\n<p><em>not so hot</em> — Goneril says this to Regan, <em>King Lear</em>\n(v. 3.67).</p>\n<p><em>pent-house</em> — <em>Macbeth</em> (i.3.19-20):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sleep shall neither night nor day<br>\nHang upon his pent-house lid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But <em>pent-house</em> here refers to eyelids, not to a lavish\napartment.</p>\n<p><em>eye-sore</em> — <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> (iii.2.103-4),\nBaptista to Petrucchio:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fie! doff this habit, shame to your estate,<br>\neye-sore to our solemn festival.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, in <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> (lines 204-5):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive,\nbe an eye-sore in my golden coat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This contemporary term, incidentally, was first recorded,\naccording to the Second Edition of <em>The Random\nHouse Unabridged</em>, around 1250-1300.</p>\n<p><em>to do (someone) wrong</em> — <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>, line\n1462:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and in <em>King Lear</em> (i.2.186), Edgar complaints:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some villain hath done me wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both lines anteceded by centuries <em>Frankie and\nJohnny</em>, not to mention Mae West.</p>\n<p><em>turn off</em> — in <em>Antony and Cleapatra</em> (iii.6.93-4), Mecaenas\ntells Octavia:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only the adulterous Antony, most large<br>\nIn his abominations, turns you off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>RH-II</em> notes that <em>turn off</em> is slang for “something or\nsomeone that makes one unsympathetic or antagonistic,”\ndating the entry 1680-90.</p>\n<p><em>like to</em> — In <em>Pericles</em> (iv.2.80), Marina says, “To\n'scape his hands where I was like to die.”  <em>RH-II</em>\nlabels this current expression to be of South Midland\nand southern U.S. origin and means “to be on\nthe verge of.”</p>\n<p><em>poop</em> — In <em>Pericles</em> (iv.2.25), as he relates what the\n“little baggage” did to the Transylvanian in the\nbrothel, Boult says that “she quickly pooped\nhim,” meaning that she overwhelmed him.  In today's\nslang, <em>pooped</em> has the sense of <em>exhausted</em>, and\nsometimes worse.</p>\n<p>Shakespeare even managed to insert a bit of\nwhat sounds like current Anglo-Yiddish slang.  In\ntwo instances, both found in <em>Venus and Adonis</em>,\nnamely, line 617:</p>\n<p>Whose tushes never sheath's he whetteth still,\nand line 624:</p>\n<p>And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay,</p>\n<p><em>tushes</em> means <em>tusks</em>.  But <em>tush</em>, or <em>tushie</em>, is current\nslang for <em>buttocks</em>, an apparent alteration of the Yiddish\n<em>tokhes</em>, of like meaning.</p>\n<p>Ah, but it is the unintentional humor we return\nto for our heartiest laughs!  In <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>,\nlines 780-81, we know that “he” refers to the sun,\nbut we may be forgiven if we assume that Tarquin is\nmeant, considering that gentleman's passionate activities\nof the night before with Lucrece:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The life of purity, the supreme fair,<br>\nEre he arrive his weary', noontide prick.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then there is this passage in <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>\n(i.3.343) that has been distinguished by being\nplaced just before the index to the eleventh edition\nof <em>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations</em> (New York, W.F.\nCollier &amp; Son, 1937):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And in such indexes, although small pricks<br>\nTo their subsequent volumes, there is seen<br>\nThe baby figure of the giant mass<br>\nOf things to come at large.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Could this be a commentary on what an arousal can\ndo for a man's morale?</p>\n<p>Ah, but one final image remains ever green!  It is\nthat of a future Rex Harrison in the role of Armado\nin <em>Love's Labour's Lost</em> (v.1.111-13) expressing to\nHolofernes his feelings toward his monarch, as he\navows how he would gladly permit his king “to lean\nupon my poor shoulder, and with his royal finger,\nthus dally with my excrement.”  Nor is the vividness\nof this tableau entirely diminished when one notes\nthat, as here used, <em>excrement</em> is a synonym for <em>hair</em>.</p>\n<p>It is too cynical to foresee that some irreverent\nsmarty-pants will one day pry and dig and garner\nfurther items of unintentional humor out of our supreme\npoet's writings?  Is it too fanciful to predict\nthat many of the Bard's words are, even now, lying\nlow awaiting the coming of the inevitable day when\nthey shall become of the bright, new-minted, contemporary\nexpressions of tomorrow?</p>\n<h1></h1>",
