<p>The knock on my office door was as gentle as a heartbeat.  I
thought at first that I had imagined it, but when I looked
at the glass-paneled door with my name on it AHA (readable
from either side) I saw the outline of what looked like a little
girl, and I wondered why she would be coming to the office of
a PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.</p>
<p>“Come in,” I said, and a porcelain doll entered my office.
She was clearly oriental, probably Chinese (like my ancestors),
petite, delicate, beautiful as a plum blossom, and not a girl at
all, but a young lady.</p>
<p>“Are you Mr. Aha?”  she asked, with temple bells in her
voice.</p>
<p>“I am.  Please sit down.  Why have you come?”</p>
<p>“Someone is trying to kill my great-grandfather.  Perhaps
you have heard of him Sum Won Hoo.  I am Wanda Hoo.”</p>
<p>The Hoo family was famous in our area; it had produced
many politicians, nominative types who were always running
for one office or another, but most of them died tragically, and
quite young.  Some said there was a curse on the family.  In
fact, I recalled that only old Sum Won and Wanda were left.
The old man was about ninety, fabled to have made his fortune
in the China trade before World War I.</p>
<p>I nodded and asked, “Why don't you inform the police?”</p>
<p>“It is a rather delicate matter because we think we know
who it is.”  She paused, then added, “His cousin, Hoom.”</p>
<p>There were old rumors of tension between the Hoo and
Hoom clans, of jealousy leading to Tong wars and disappearances,
even of attempted assassinations.  No one knew exactly
why.  The police could find out nothing.</p>
<p>My honorable ancestors often said, “Ask the obvious
questions first.”  I went to the heart of the matter and asked,
ungrammatically, “Why would Hoom want to kill Hoo?”</p>
<p>She hesitated.  “It's because of the tontine.”</p>
<p>The answer stunned me.  “What's a tontine?”</p>
<p>“It's a kind of business arrangement, an insurance plan,
whereby a group of participants buy a shared annuity, and as
each participant dies, it is agreed that the final survivor will
receive the whole amount.  It was very common among maritime
families, a form of gambling.  We orientals love to
gamble.”  She lowered her head.  “Now I think the tontine was
a big mistake.”</p>
<p>“Your great-grandfather is a member of a tontine?”</p>
<p>“Yes.  He and his two cousins and a friend entered into an
agreement seventy years ago.  The friend, who was older, was
named Whence, and he died quickly, with no family to mourn
him.  The one cousin, Hoom, I have mentioned.  But the fate of
the other cousin, Hooz, is a sad tale.  At the turn of the century,
Yu No Hooz was a strong young man, able to pilot a junk, fight
off pirates, and navigate across the Pacific.  The month before
he was to marry, he began to lose his mind.  Some say a villain
put powdered dragon bone into his wine.  At any rate, Hooz
became extremely possessive; he thought he owned everything.
He began to relate in a possessive way to animals and things,
not just to people.  Hoo and Hoom were shocked that their
cousin could lose his human orientation.  Hooz's bride-to-be
drank poison rather than enter into a humiliating marriage.”</p>
<p>“Where is Hooz now?  Is he dead?”</p>
<p>“No.  He was committed to a mental institution in Denver
sixty years ago, and there he languishes.  The Jespersen Foundation,
which manages the tontine, has declared him legally
unable to inherit.”</p>
<p>I thought for a moment.  With Whence and Hooz out of
the running, only Hoo and Hoom were left.  No wonder Wanda
thought Hoom was trying to kill Hoo.</p>
<p>“What was the nature of the attempt?”</p>
<p>She pulled an envelope out of her purse and handed it to
me.  The address was clearly printed: Sum Won Hoo, at the
address of his famous mansion.  Inside was a single sheet of
white paper with a large “W” printed on it in red.</p>
<p>“He received this four days ago and immediately collapsed.
We have him in the emergency ward of the Pronoun
Resuscitation Institute; his situation is critical.  I still have hope
because he has been in and out of comas many times before
this.”</p>
<p>“Did anyone talk to Hoom about this?”</p>
<p>“No.  Hoom disappeared three days ago,” she informed
me, “as soon as word of the attack was made known.”</p>
<p>I decided to take on the case.  Wanda added that she was
Hoo's sole heir, all the others having died or been mysteriously
killed off, and she felt herself in some danger now.</p>
<p>“Do you know who Hoom's heirs are?”</p>
<p>She paused.  “He has only one, just like our clan.  His
family too has suffered many tragedies.  His great-grandson,
Will Hoom, is his only living descendant.” She added, “Will
and I went to the same college.  We both wish the tontine
madness would end.”  With lowered eyes, she whispered,
“Perhaps one day we can end the terrible separation that is
causing the competition.”</p>
<p>“Does the W mean anything special to you?”</p>
<p>“No,” she replied.  “Unless, of course, it refers to Will, or
to my name, Wanda.”</p>
<p>After she left, I went directly to consult with my friend
Billy Emerald, lex guard at the Oakland dictionary depot.  He
had not heard of the tontine, but he knew Hoo and Hoom had
been fighting for many years.</p>
<p>“Aha,” he said, “we guards have been watching the battle.
Hoom is definitely weaker and seems to be losing.  His only
strength is in his objectivity; he prides himself on being able to
avoid subjectivity in all things.  Hoo, on the other hand, accuses
him of often being distant from his antecedents, of being a
humble follower, even of associating with preppies and following
them.  It was a scandal twenty years ago.  To counter that
story, Hoom has endowed a famous prep school and takes great
interest in education.  Hoo is totally media-oriented, attaching
himself closely to celebrities and famous subjects.”</p>
<p>“Where is Hoom's prep school?”</p>
<p>“It's called the Spenser Academy and is up in Riverstone.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Billy.”  The trip to Riverstone was short.  If Hoom
could be found anywhere today, it would be at a fashionable
prep school.</p>
<p>The headmaster at Spenser, Mr. Parsing, was a stickler for
rules, but he arranged for me to talk with some of the senior
students.  I walked over to their dormitory, a clean well-lighted
place, and knocked on the door of a suite for four.  Their names
were on plates just under the room number: B. Low, A. Cross,
B. Hind, and N. Too.  I was told that they were exemplary
preps.  All four were studying in the living area.</p>
<p>“Has anything unusual happened in the last three days?”  I
asked.</p>
<p>Silence.  Then Low said, “Nothing.  We're studying for midterms
now.”</p>
<p>“What about strangers on campus or strange phone calls
or deliveries?  Any differences in routines?”</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>My oriental ancestors always said, “Ask the river and the
ocean may respond.”  I looked at their buttoned-down shirts
and took a wild guess.  “Who does your laundry?”</p>
<p>They all laughed and said, “Shur Ting, on Main Street.
Maybe you'd like to see the fortunes we found in our pockets
today?”</p>
<p>They each pulled out small strips of paper like fortune-cookie
sayings and presented them to me.  They all had the
same message: Hold Onto Old Meanings.</p>
<p>“Capital,” I said to myself, “a capital idea.”</p>
<p>I thanked them and hurried down to Main Street.  The
case was nearing the end.</p>
<p>There in the steaming back room of Shur Ting's Laundry,
I found Hoom, busy putting shirts in packages and tucking
adages into the pockets.  What better place for a rich old
Chinese gentleman to hide than in a Chinese laundry?  “You
must come with me,” I said, and he came quietly.</p>
<p>The scene in the hospital room was like a scroll painting 
the dying patriarch in bed, surrounded by the two young heirs
and his equally elderly cousin.  On the edge of the group was
the private investigator.  But I was also the artist who had
arranged the tableau.</p>
<p>“Honorable Hoo,” I began, talking to the silent figure in
the bed.  “Let me assure you that Hoom did not mail you the
almost fatal letter.  At first I thought it was a W but I soon
realized my mistake when I recalled that my ancestors often
said, 'The view from the South is not the same as the view
from the North.'  The W was actually an M, and that is the
letter you saw.  Of course, the M has been the indicator of the
major difference between you and your cousin all these years.
When you saw the M, you assumed it was from Hoom, who
often tried to irritate you.  High blood pressure did the rest.  But
if you had had time to examine the postmark on the letter, you
would have discovered it was sent from Colorado.  It was Hooz
who mailed it, hoping to create dissension.”</p>
<p>Hoo blinked his eyes and smiled like a Buddha.  Hoom
shuffled, ill at ease in Hoo's presence.</p>
<p>Wanda spoke.  Just as she had started the case, she
presented a solution to the whole affair.  “Dear great-grand-father,”
she began, “may I ask your permission to marry the
man I love, Will Hoom, the great-grandson of Hoom?  He will
ask you officially if you agree.  We love each other.  Why must
the tontine continue?  We can bring the families together after
all these years.  Please give us your blessing.”</p>
<p>The rest is history.  In my office the next day I read the
announcement on the society page “W.  Hoo to marry W.
Hoom.”  From now on, I thought, the relationship would be
carefully shared, each one relating in his or her special way.
The fight was over.</p>
<p>The wedding a few weeks later was lovely; Wanda looked
wonderful.  I was listed in the guest book as “friend of
relatives.”</p>
<p>My palindromic name has made me sensitive to spelling
oddities, and, as I was writing up the case in my office, I
pondered the significance of certain letters, especially first and
last letters.  And I thanked my oriental ancestors for giving me
an A.</p>
