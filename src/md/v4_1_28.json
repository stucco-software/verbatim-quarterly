What I'm saying is\nthat nobody has complained—so far, anyway.</p>\n<p>Among the first items I developed was the “profundrum,”\na word I created to encompass various statements\nI've developed (and collected) to make the reader think a\nlittle more than usual.  A few random examples are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Happiness is no laughing matter.</em></p>\n<p><em>Anything worth doing is worth doing.</em></p>\n<p><em>Why not take your mother-in-law out to the next swap\\\nmeet and see what you can get for her?</em></p>\n<p><em>He who laughs, lasts.</em></p>\n<p><em>The darker the light, the darker the dark.</em></p>\n<p><em>People never go there anymore; it's too crowded</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the meantime, I've graduated to what I term “ormonyms”\nbecause I didn't know what they were.  I sent\nsome to Mr. Urdang who claims they are “junctures” but he\nhasn't convinced me on this as yet.  However, I have to give\nhis comments serious consideration because he really knows\nmore about this semantic business than I do.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of this article is to get some more\ncomments concerning this semantic exercise from our learned\nbrethren.  My main rule is that they read differently but\nsound the same.  It would be most interesting to see if anyone\nelse is creating/saving such semantic oddities—and what\nthey may have come up with.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples I've created—with a few which\nhave been contributed by my readers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The stuffy nose can lead to problems.</em><br>\n<em>The stuff he knows can lead to problems.</em></p>\n<p><em>Where is the spice center?</em><br>\n<em>Where is the spy center?</em></p>\n<p><em>Are you aware of the words you have just uttered?</em><br>\n<em>Are you aware of the words you have just stuttered?</em></p>\n<p><em>That's the biggest hurdle I've ever seen!</em><br>\n<em>That's the biggest turtle I've ever seen!</em></p>\n<p><em>I'm taking a nice cold shower.</em><br>\n<em>I'm taking an ice cold shower.</em></p>\n<p><em>He would kill Hamlet for that reason.</em><br>\n<em>He would kill Hamlet for that treason.</em></p>\n<p><em>You'd be surprised to see a mint spy in your bank.</em><br>\n<em>You'd be surprised to see a mince pie in your bank.</em></p>\n<p><em>Some others I've seen...</em><br>\n<em>Some mothers I've seen...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here are a couple of examples which do not qualify:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Reading in the library is sometimes allowed.</em><br>\n<em>Reading in the library is sometimes aloud.</em></p>\n<p><em>A politician's fate often hangs in a delegate balance.</em><br>\n<em>A politician's fate often hangs in a delicate balance.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My reason they don't qualify is because they are too\neasy.  It's using two words that sound the same or similar.</p>\n<p>Mr. Urdang sent me an example of junctures which was\nthe sound of “white shoes”and “why choose.”  I tried to put\nthese into a duplicate sentence to qualify them for an ormonym.\nI haven't made a rule about punctuation as yet so I\ntried to make a sentence out of them.  A bit awkward, but\nhere's how it worked out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>White shoes; the trademark of Pat Boone.</em><br>\n<em>Why choose the trademark of Pat Boone.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe what I'm doing is taking junctures and making a\nsentence with them and that's what an ormonym really is.\nAnyway, it's fun and maybe it serves to crack a smile here\nand there; if so, it's worth it.</p>\n<p>I'd appreciate any input; pro, con or whatever is in between.\nAnd maybe we need a word for that—or is there one\nalready?</p>\n<h2></h2>",
