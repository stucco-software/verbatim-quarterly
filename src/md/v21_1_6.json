If you recall, “When the moon hits your eye like a great pizza pie/That's amore.” Thais chose to hear <em>dead</em> for <em>that</em> and corrupted '<em>s amore</em> to <em>smollay;</em> thus <em>dedsmollay</em> has been a common slang word for 'dead' for thirty years or so!</p>\n<p>Thailand is the only southeast Asian nation to have avoided colonization by a western power, so there are significantly fewer English loanwords in Thai than there are French in Lao, Vietnamese, and Khmer, English in Malay and Burmese, and Dutch in Indonesia's various languages. That is not to say that Thai has been slow or reluctant to adopt or assimilate words from other languages, but they are mostly Sanskrit/Pali, Khmer, and Chinese. The first English loanwords date from perhaps 100 years ago, exhibiting steady growth since then with a truly spectacular spurt over the past twenty years, predictably in the fields of science, business and economics, politics, fashion, pop culture, and so on.</p>\n<p>Here are a few of the more interesting ones I have come across. As in all languages, the older a loanword, the less recognizable it is, so I start with some of these and then move on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>bam</em> a pump.</p>\n<p><em>bok</em> the game of poker.</p>\n<p><em>engerhon</em> non-imbibed alcohol.</p>\n<p><em>godang</em> warehouse. [from <em>godown</em>]</p>\n<p><em>gok</em> tap/faucet. [from stop<em>cock</em>]</p>\n<p><em>heema</em> snow. [from the <em>Hima</em>layas? Thailand never experiences snow; indeed, it is such an alien concept that, if shown a postcard of a snow-covered landscape, working-class Thais say it looks delicious rather than beautiful. Strictly speaking it is not an English loanword.]</p>\n<p><em>(rote) may</em> city bus. [<em>rote</em> means 'land conveyance' and <em>may</em> comes from <em>mail.</em> The first van- (and I suppose vaguely bus-) like vehicles common in Bangkok were used for mail delivery. Also <em>rote tua</em> 'tour bus,' <em>rote air</em> 'air con bus,' and <em>rote cote</em> 'coach']</p>\n<p><em>reet</em> wreath.</p>\n<p><em>satoh</em> to store.</p>\n<p><em>dan</em> ton.</p>\n<p><em>goolud</em> gross.</p>\n<p><em>lah</em> yard. Now used only for cloth.</p>\n<p><em>lim</em> ream.</p>\n<p><em>loh</em> dozen.</p>\n<p><em>aksairt</em> abscess.</p>\n<p><em>bar beer</em> outdoor beer bar. No prizes for guessing that adjectives follow nouns in Thai!</p>\n<p><em>bartendee</em> female bartender. [<em>Dee</em> is from <em>lady</em>]</p>\n<p>(<em>riak</em>) <em>bip bip</em> to page someone. Riak means 'to call.'</p>\n<p><em>cheque spring</em> bounced cheque.</p>\n<p><em>choke up</em> shock absorbers.</p>\n<p><em>dy</em> blow-dry.</p>\n<p><em>Erawit</em> Elvis.</p>\n<p><em>giff shop</em> novelty items such as plastic vomit, whoopee cushions. [from <em>gift shop</em>]</p>\n<p>(<em>reua</em>) <em>loh</em> rowing boat. Also <em>reua yort</em> [from <em>yacht</em>] used in the sense of 'luxury cruiser.' A sailboat in Thai literally and rather charmingly translates as 'a boat with a leaf.'</p>\n<p><em>lingmote</em> remote control device.</p>\n<p><em>Robin Hood</em> illegal immigrant worker.</p>\n<p>(<em>khon</em>) <em>serb</em> waiter or waitress. [<em>Khon</em> means 'person' and <em>serb</em>, is from <em>serve.</em>]</p>\n<p>(<em>nak</em>) <em>sing</em> lunatic drivers in flash motors. [<em>Nak</em> means 'person' and <em>sing</em> comes from <em>racing</em>]</p>\n<p><em>sow bow</em> walkman. [from <em>sound bound.</em> I have not been able to unearth who coined this or if it is exclusive to Thai.]</p>\n<p><em>(jai)</em> <em>sport</em> to be a good sport. [<em>Jai</em> means 'heart.' Numerous Thai expressions use <em>jai,</em> e.g., <em>khaojai,</em> 'to understand,' literally 'to enter the heart.']</p>\n<p><em>tomsin</em> tonsils.</p>\n<p><em>v.d.o.</em> phonetic rendition of <em>video.</em> Often spelled in Latin rather than Thai characters.</p>\n<p><em>fen</em> boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, minor wife, lover. [from <em>fan</em> 'enthusiast']</p>\n<p><em>toot</em> any male homosexual. [from the film <em>Tootsie</em> in which Dustin Hoffman dressed up as a woman. This is odd because transvestites are openly accepted in Thai society, and male homosexuals are not considered—as they are by some Japanese housewives I have met—as wanting to cross dress.]</p>\n<p><em>gay king</em> dominant partner in a male homosexual relationship.</p>\n<p><em>gay queen</em> partner who assumes the feminine role in a male homosexual relationship.</p>\n<p><em>lb</em> lesbian. Also <em>ledbian</em> and <em>bian.</em></p>\n<p><em>dee</em> partner who assumes the female role and appearance in a lesbian relationship. [from <em>lady</em>]</p>\n<p><em>torm</em> partner who assumes the masculine role and appearance in a lesbian relationship. [from <em>tomboy.</em>] Also used in the English sense of a girl who climbs trees, picks scabs, disdains frocks, though less so nowadays.</p>\n<p><em>sexy bom</em> sex symbol. Probably an elided mix up of <em>sexy, sex bomb,</em> and <em>sex symbol</em> (/sek/sy/m/ bon/) because <em>l</em> is not a final consonant in Thai and if encountered in a loanword becomes <em>n</em> (or in this case <em>m</em> as <em>bomb</em> is also a loanword).</p>\n<p>Thus, the present writer is addressed in Thai as Mr Porn!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I should like to end with a mystery—nothing to do with loanwords at all but fascinating nonetheless. The Thai name for the Beatles is <em>Sii Tao Tong</em> 'the Four Golden Turtles.' So far I have been unable to find out why but I live in hope.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
