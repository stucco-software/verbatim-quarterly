Dougherty's article, “French\nLeave” [XVII, 3], concerning the difficulty of translating\nsatisfactorily the title of the movie <em>Au Revoir\nles Enfants</em>, reminds me of a conversation that, as an\nundergraduate at Princeton, I had in the 1930s with\nProfessor Maurice E. Coindreau, who was engaged\nin translating Hemingway into French.  As an example\nof one kind of difficulty that translators face,\nCoindreau cited the title of Faulkner's <em>The Unvanquished</em>\nand asked, “Is it plural or singular?  Masculine\nor feminine?”  He said that the translators, R. N.\nRaimbault and C.P. Gorce, had put those questions\nto Faulkner, who only laughed.  Knowing that any of\nthe four possibilities would considerably narrow the\nrange of suggestion in the original, but helpless,\nthey settled for <em>L'Invaincu</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[Thompson Webb, Madison, Wisconsin]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
