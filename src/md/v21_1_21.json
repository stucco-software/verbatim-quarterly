The problem, as in most usage matters, is that those who fail to distinguish between <em>classic</em> and <em>classical, infer</em> and <em>imply, like</em> and <em>as</em>, etc., are blissfully unaware that any question exists: consequently, not being unsure of anything, they never bother to check. One is moved to suggest that it is the responsibility of teachers of English to implant in the subconsciouses of their students a soupçon of suspicion that there might be something questionable about a number of words and constructions in the language. These days one despairs of the teachers, for they, too, seem totally oblivious to style and traditional practice.

Radio</em> 3, the longstanding BBC station that has broadcast classical music for many years, has not been replaced by this commercial parvenu, but it should be noted that Radio 3 broadcasts <em>classical</em> music, while the new station is engaged in a different enterprise. Not only is <em>Classic</em> music not always classical, but there is an utter lack of sensitivity in the selection of music played: <em>Anitra's Dance</em> could well be preceded by Schoenberg and followed by Scarlatti or <em>O Sole Mio</em> sung by Tagliavini. One night, I tuned in and heard an extraordinarily cacophonous piece that sounded like souls groaning in hell alternating with dissonant organ music; as I could not believe what I was hearing, I continued to listen; I was tortured for about half an hour but persisted, as I wanted to hear the title in order to make certain that I would switch off if anyone ever threatened to play it again. Unfortunately, I have forgotten the title (and composer), but a reader might recognize it from my reasonably accurate description.</p>\n<p>Radio stations that play classical music might be criticized for allowing Telemann to be segued by Tchaikovsky, but that is, surely, a sophisticated criticism. This listener's knowledge of and taste in classical music is not very sophisticated, but the sequences broadcast by Classic FM serve to demonstrate the worst features of the differences between <em>classical</em> and <em>classic</em>. Yet, perhaps predictably for those who have a cynical view of public taste, a recent [March 1994] newspaper report reveals that Classic FM has a regular weekly audience nearly two million greater than that of Radio 3.</p>\n<p>While on the subject of British radio, about a year ago, the radio station Jazz FM was establishd in London, purportedly to play Jazz morning, noon, and night. From the music played, it would appear that all music not classifiable as <em>classical</em> is considered to be Jazz, requiring a new definition of <em>jazz</em> to be considered by (British) lexiographers.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
