Of course, as I had been telling myself all along, police work is tedious; but <em>someone</em> has to do it. Or so I had always thought. Now, however, I paused in my labors after a short stint of alphabetizing and partially annotating a few recent additions, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[Budget] cuts were made all across the <em>border</em>.”</p>\n<p>“[The candidate] must <em>definitive</em> his position.”</p>\n<p>“...a fashion that was <em>dig rigueur</em>...”</p>\n<p>“A storm system is now <em>domineering</em> the weather.”</p>\n<p>“...by one of the <em>foundling fathers</em> of our country...”</p>\n<p>“After reading the <em>glum</em> statistics”</p>\n<p>“Their coffee is <em>grounded</em> daily.”</p>\n<p>“this was <em>hollowed</em> ground.” (Paul Gigot on the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour, 1994.)</p>\n<p>“Now we are being <em>indulged</em>[deluged] with snow.”</p>\n<p>“[A respected local philanthropist's] name will live in <em>infamy</em>.”</p>\n<p>“The dead were <em>interned</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe, as we are about to <em>invoke</em> on a course...” (U.S. Army chaplain in Vicenza, Italy, addressing troops soon to embark for Bosnia.)</p>\n<p>“A cherished <em>momentum</em> of...”</p>\n<p>“The issue [of the two murders] is a <em>mute</em> point.”</p>\n<p>“He was <em>oustered</em> from the Party.”</p>\n<p>“it <em>piquéd</em> his interest.”</p>\n<p>“Big-Business-bashing ...is nothing but tub-thumping <em>popularism</em>.”</p>\n<p>“The attack was <em>provocated by...</em>”</p>\n<p>“This <em>raked</em> havoc with investors.”</p>\n<p>“...<em>rendering</em> the social fabric.” (Paul Gigot)</p>\n<p>“Supplies were <em>replentished...</em>”</p>\n<p>“Women are <em>reticent</em> to buy such clothes...”</p>\n<p>“Pat Buchanan has <em>transpired</em> [transcended?] his early reputation.”</p>\n<p>“A prison <em>trustee</em>...” (newspaper article)</p>\n<p>“He <em>waived</em> goodbye.” (newspaper article)</p>\n<p>“The fee was <em>wavered</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Somehow, he <em>wrangled</em> an invitation.”</p>\n<p>“The [victorious] army <em>yielded</em> power harshly...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was the last example which gave me pause. Perhaps, I thought, the army yielded power harshly while wielding a no-iron velvet fist?</p>\n<p>Already, while <em>working my head to the bone</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-b1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup> on the above examples and others <em>too humorous to mention,</em> I had been visited by fond memories of Jane and Goodman Ace, those masters of malapropism—though, according to an article in <em>The New Yorker</em> which I read years ago, Goodman was the “master”; Jane was a real-life Mrs. Malaprop. I had made a list of the Jane Aceisms in that article. I still had that list and now, rather than just <em>sitting there like a bum on a log,</em> I compared Jane's words with my own burgeoning record of unstrung and unlamented lapses, many, still to be entered in my trustee notebook.</p>\n<p>When I had at last poured over the two lists— the one, so much too brief; the other, so much too wrong—<em>you could have knocked me over with a fender!</em> What a disillumining experience! <em>Entre nous and me</em>, until then, I had believed that, in any <em>baffle of wits,</em> Jane Ace would have <em>won, thumbs down. In all my bored days,</em> I would never have believed that she had not reached the highest <em>pinochle of success.</em> Now, I was saddened to see that her words, compared with those of today's ragged individualists, were <em>thin and emancipated.</em> No longer was she <em>the human domino</em> she had always seemed to me. Hey, you, and a lass, Jane Ace! Your turkeys have <em>come home to roast,</em> with avengings!</p>\n<p>I saw that it was high tide for me to stop <em>wrecking my brain</em> looking for more more <em>flies in the oatmeal</em>. It was time, too, to remember that words, like men, are cremated equal. In short, if hers was to remain the <em>clowning achievement,</em> it was time for me to shred my list—and not a moment to swoon.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/stx_Verbatim_The_Language_Quarterly_v23n4_Autumn_1998\">Internet Archive copy of this issue</a></p>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-b1\">\n<p><em>Italicized phrases are Jane Aceisms.
