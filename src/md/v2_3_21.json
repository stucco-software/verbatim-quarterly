We doubt it.  Willard Espy, erstwhile <em>Reader's Digest</em> editor turned ghost writer, radio interviewer, and public relations man, has mined a wealth of linguistic gems and, in the <em>Almanac</em>, has provided them with a Tiffany setting.  In the face of such wit, it is bootless to try to be a clever reviewer.  For here are one-liners, anecdotes, poems, games, puzzles—a playful gallimaufry arranged in almanac style to titillate you day by day for a year: then you can start in afresh.</p>\n<p>Merciful the arrangement, for too much of a good thing, not properly organized, can become cloying.  Merciful, too, are the Glossary (for words like <em>rhopalic</em>) and the appendix of solutions and answers.  It is a pity that young people are not exposed to so informative and entertaining a text as this to whet their appetites for the study of language.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
