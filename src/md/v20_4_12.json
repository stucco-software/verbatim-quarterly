The more ancient among us (observers) are inclined to offer the consolation, “This, too, shall pass ...,” but that is of little comfort to those whose sense of security is affected by change of any kind. A view that is at times dispassionate and occasionally bordering on the enthusiastic is put forth in this book by Paul Coggle, described as “a Senior Lecturer in German at the University of Kent at Canterbury and occasional lecturer and commentator on the growing trend of Estuary English.” The book is deceptively packaged in the guise of a frivolous paperback by a publisher fast becoming known for a prolific output of language books of great variety (including some of my own).</p>\n<p>As Coggle explains,“the term <em>Estuary English</em> was coined in the early eighties by David Rosewarne... [H]e described Estuary English as a 'variety of modified regional speech. It is a mixture of non-regional and local south-eastern English pronunciation and intonation.' The estuary referred to is the Thames estuary ... [including] the inhabitants of North Kent and South Essex.” The term is not unfamiliar to me, but I was glad to have a definition for it. It would be impossible to describe here all the characteristics of the dialect—one should acquire the book for that information. Suffice it to say that many of its chief features, like the substitution of a glottal stop for all medial dental sounds (<em>d</em> and <em>t</em>), the replacement of the final <em>l</em>-sounds by what phoneticians call a “dark <em>l</em>,” which sounds more like a <em>w: Paul, bell,</em> and <em>fault</em> sound like <em>Pauw, beuw,</em> and <em>fauw</em>, and the intensification of a y-glide, especially after <em>t,</em> into a <em>sh</em>-sound, yielding <em>stshewpid</em> for <em>stupid</em> and <em>stshew</em> for <em>stew</em>.</p>\n<p>This is not an exhaustive catalogue of the modifications, some of which make it extremely difficult for even a native Brit to understand what is being said. Television performers like Jonathan Ross are often totally incomprehensible to native speakers of British English; those who think they understand Scouse, Cockney, Estuary, and other dialects because they (like me) have lived for many years amongst the natives, should be condemned to listening to Frank Bruno interviews, Rab C. Nesbitt sitcoms, and episodes of <em>Eastenders</em>. Listening to Ross and others of his persuasion (including Rory Bremner and RP speaker Clive Anderson), one gets the impression that an essential ingredient of communicating the message is to articulate carefully the unimportant things, then deliberately mumble, as quickly as possible, the punch lines. I never had trouble understanding the Two Ronnies, but I find a great deal of British TV comedy leaving me glumly sober, while the audiences fall about clutching their sides.</p>\n<p>The approach of <em>Do You Speak Estuary?</em> is somewhat facetious, but for all that, it carries a useful message, one treated from the point of view of the RP speaker in <em>Does Accent Matter?</em>, by John Honey [XVI,1,10]. The only error I noted was that <em>quick</em> and <em>slow</em> are classifiable only as adjectives, suggesting that they do not occur as adverbs (p. 69).</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
