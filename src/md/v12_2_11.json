Schur, the\nmost comprehensive work in the field and a VERBATIM\nBook—I acknowledge a modicum of admiration for its generally\nsimple approach to a subject that can become relatively\ncomplicated.  To be sure, the complications are not\nstrictly lexical or even lexicographical: they stem chiefly\nfrom the differences between the kind of lexical alternation\nof the <em>bonnet/hood, roundabout/traffic circle, dustman/\ngarbage collector</em> type and the type that is sociolinguistic\nand meaningless without some sort of acculturative comment,\nlike <em>tea</em>, which occurs in both varieties of English but\nmeans quite different things in each, <em>the Ashes</em>, which\ndoesn't occur at all in American English, and <em>back bencher,\nBath bun</em>, and <em>pound</em> (monetary), which have no equivalent\nin American English and, if encountered by an American,\nrequire some sort of explanatory definition.</p>\n<p>Although Moss has handled the equivalents well, his\nexplanatory definitions leave something to be desired.  One\nof the main shortcomings of the book is reflected in the lack\nof research: the author was either completely unaware of\n<em>English English</em> or was completely oblivious to it, and one\ncan only conclude, in examining his dictionary, that it\nwould have benefited greatly from familiarity with the content\nand treatment given in other books, as well.  The copyright\nnotice bears the dates 1973 and 1984, and, from the\nreviews quoted from the <em>International Herald Tribune, The\nEconomist</em>, and <em>The Sunday Times</em> in the back-cover blurb,\none must surmise that the book was originally published in\nEngland.</p>\n<p>As for the entries themselves, they are brief and generally\nuseful.  They begin to feel inadequate when one looks up\nterms like <em>bristols</em> to learn that (quite correctly) the meaning\ngiven is 'breasts.'  But the label “Cockney” is not helpful, as\nthe proper form would have been “Cockney rhyming slang,\nshort for <em>Bristol City/titty</em>.”  Similarly, those wondering\nwhere sod, <em>n</em>. and <em>v</em>., (which has no usage label, though it is\ncertainly slang) came from will find no information about\nits derivation from <em>sodomy, sodomite, sodomize.  Blooming</em>,\non the other hand, is labeled “<em>col</em>(loquial),” and is defined as\n“an all-purpose adjective, much as 'bloody' is, but mostly\nworking-class,” which doesn't tell the story at all: it was for\nmany years a euphemism for <em>bloody</em> and is rarely heard\ntoday mainly because there is little reluctance in using\n<em>bloody</em> (once taboo); it is somewhat old-fashioned, almost\nhaving achieved the status of “Wodehousian” slang typified\nby <em>old chap, old bean</em>, and <em>Ain't it?</em>, now found mainly on\nthe lips of Bertie Wooster and those who emulate him\n(mostly Americans who acquired what they know about\nBritish English from <em>Jeeves</em> and similar books).</p>\n<p>The book is divided into two alphabetic sections, like a\nbilingual dictionary, one American-British, the other\nBritish-American.  The foregoing comments pertain to the\nlatter section, which contains a number of entries that could\nnot be classified as British: <em>aerial</em>, a variant for 'antenna'—\n<em>not</em> “antennae”—in American English [AE] is the only term\nfor the radio-TV type in British English [BE]; unfortunately,\n<em>antenna</em>, which in BE used to refer only to the entomological\nkind, is not an entry; <em>anorak</em> is no longer strictly\n<em>BE</em> for 'parka'; <em>Antipodes</em> never was BE (by which I mean it\nwas universally known in English); similarly, <em>balaclava (helmet),\nbarrel organ, bespoke</em> ('custom-tailored'), <em>billiards</em>,\netc., such entries amounting to, perhaps, five percent of the\ntotal.  The comment at <em>bill</em>, “The word 'check' is not used for\nany kind of bill in Britain,” is just plain wrong—it is used\nfrequently today, possibly having been picked up as an\nAmericanism from tourists.  What is lacking, in the main, is\ncommentary on the usage of some terms.  For instance, use\nof the term <em>swan-upping</em> is always greeted with a smile\nin England.  Also, some terms are missing, e.g., <em>poof</em> or\n<em>pouf(fe)</em> 'homosexual,' and others, e.g., <em>glaze</em> and <em>glazier</em>,\nare just as American as they are British.</p>\n<p>In the American-British section, users may be misled by\nthe inclusion of entries like <em>filling station</em> (widely used in\nBritain), <em>chutzpah</em> (Yiddish, not American, though the\ninfluence of Yiddish on <em>AE</em> is admittedly greater than on\n<em>BE</em>), <em>pipe story</em> (which I've never encountered), and <em>polecat</em>\n(which I recently encountered in a crossword puzzle in <em>The\nTimes)</em>.  Where is <em>Civil War</em> (different events in Britain and\nAmerica)?  And why is <em>cookie-pusher</em> in?  And why is <em>pissed\n(off)</em> in with a “<em>col</em> (loquial)” label?: it is taboo (or nearly so)\nin America, while <em>pissed</em> ('drunk')—as well as <em>balls, knockers,\narse</em>, etc.—can be heard (and sometimes seen) on British\nTV.  Also, the statement that <em>pissed</em> “never means drunk, as\nin British” is simply at variance with the facts.  And it would\nbe useful to have included <em>dummy</em>, with its senses, in the AE\nsection as well as the BE.</p>\n<p>As with most books, there are some good points in this\none, but they are scarcely inspirational.  The errors abound:\nthe classification of <em>maisonette</em> into the British-American\nsection is simply wrong, as I have encountered its use in\nreal-estate advertising for several decades; the omission,\nfrom the BE section, of <em>estate agent</em> (for AE <em>real estate\nagent)</em>; the equivalent given there of <em>realtor</em>, which is, in\nfact, <em>Realtor</em>, a registered title; the omission from the entry\n<em>rock and rye</em> of any mention of the large block of rock candy\nin the bottle (whence, of course, the <em>rock</em>); the inclusion of\n<em>eavestrough??</em>  (for 'guttering'); the inclusion in BE of <em>gunsmith</em>\n(same as in <em>AE</em>); <em>runner beans</em> (<em>BE</em>) are 'green or\nstring beans' in <em>AE</em>, not <em>French beans</em>, which are green\nbeans sliced lengthwise.  I have never heard of <em>fruit bread</em>; a\n<em>garter snake</em> does not have “three stripes around its body”\nbut along it; <em>gloryhole</em> is too rare to be included; <em>gook</em>\nshould have a label other than just “<em>col</em>(loquial)” (as properly\ndone for <em>greaser, guinea</em>, and <em>wop</em>); <em>Gulla</em> (properly\n<em>Gullah</em>) is too rare for inclusion; and <em>gyp</em> 'cheat, swindle' is\nnot necessarily “used lightheartedly.”</p>\n<p>In short, Mr. Moss has some work to do, at home and\nabroad.  Period.  (Which isn't in <em>AE</em>, though <em>full stop</em> is in\n<em>BE.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
