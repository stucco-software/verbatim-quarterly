There is no ban on transmitting his image on television, but the audio portion of any statement he makes is blacked out. In recent months, during the negotiations between the British government and the various factions in Northern Ireland, there have been occasions when Adams has “spoken” on television (and, of course, radio), and, because of the ban, an actor (with an Irish accent) has been engaged to lip-synch Adams's speech. This creates an odd effect, for the broadcast is preceded by the announcement, “The voice you hear is that of an actor speaking the words of Jerry Adams.” On television, a notice to that effect sometimes appears on the screen. The majority of people have no idea of what Adams sounds like, so now everyone thinks his voice is that of the actor who reads his speeches and comments. Perhaps Adams is speaking in Irish Gaelic (he could do Erse!) and we are merely listening to a translator. For that matter, those of us who have watched and listened to Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Chou En-lai, and just about anyone else whose speech is translated for broadcast have not the slightest idea of what those speakers' “real” voices sound like.
