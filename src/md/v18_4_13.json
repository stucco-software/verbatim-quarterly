If Yiddish is the source of <em>gunsel,</em> someone\nwill have to produce an etymon that is phonologically\nmore likely than <em>gendzl</em> or, if that is indeed\nits etymon, explain the irregular sound change.  A\nthread running through all these mistaken etymologies\nis that their supporters think that the only criterion\nin etymology is “if it sounds like <em>x</em>, then it must\nbe derived from <em>x</em>.”  That misconception can be seen\non a grand scale in Isaac Mozeson's <em>The Word: The\nDictionary That Reveals the Hebrew Source of English,</em>\nwhich purports to show that about 22,000 (!)\nEnglish words are of Hebrew origin.  That book is so\nbrimming with error that the title of the review of it\nin <em>Jewish Language Studies</em> [Vol. 2, 1990, pp. 105-83]\nsums it up neatly: “Fiction or Medieval Philology.”</p>\n<p>“Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be\nwhipped out, when Lady the brach may stand by the\nfire and stink.”  [<em>King Lear</em>, I, iv, 110-12].</p>\n<p><em>[David L.
