The broadest speech\ncommunity is that using “the language” itself.  In the\ncase of English, this is the body of speakers not only\nin the home area of the British Isles but in the farflung\nregions where English has been carried.  Then\nthere are speech communities of descending size, on\nthe basis of geography, social class, education, occupation,\nceremonial activities, recreational interests, and\nso on, until one reaches the fundamental speech community,\nthe family.</p>\n<p>In this article I present examples of words that\nhave had their currency within family limits.  Here we\ncan see to good advantage the effervescing of language\ncreation.  My material is drawn from a variety of\nsources: oral reports from friends and students, autobiographies\nand reminiscences, and in some cases\nfictional accounts that report family situations with\nan attempt at verisimilitude.</p>\n<p>Let us first take up some expressions that involve\nfigurative speech, chiefly metaphorical leaps in the\nnaming of things.  In a New York family, according to\na student, parsnips are known as <em>white carrots</em> and\npepper as <em>black salt</em>.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">2</a></sup> In the family of Henry Beckett,\na New York journalist, an airplane was called a <em>bird-bus</em>,\nfrom the coinage of his daughter Martha, and the\nAmerican Museum of Natural History was <em>the bone\nhouse</em>.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup> In another New York family,\nthat of Frederic Fredman, <em>pooh-pooh-head</em>, coined by a daughter, is a\nterm of derogation used about adults. William Holt, an English broadcaster, has reported\nan animal known as a <em>Yukon</em>, invented by his\ndaughter:</p>\n<p>She had invented fanciful animals which were suggested\nto her by new words and names which she had heard or\ncome across when reading.  Animals such as 'Yukons.'\nShe really believed at one time that there was such an\nanimal.  The word 'fetlock' provided her with a useful\ncollective noun for associating with Yukons—'a fetlock\nof Yukons.'  When I probed her with questions as to\nwhere her idea of a 'Yukon' had come from she told me\nshe had seen a book being loaded on to one of my motor\nlibraries, called <em>The Call of the Yukon</em>, and I have no\ndoubt that she distinctly heard its peculiar cry. <sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-4\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Let us turn next to instances in which devices\nof word coinage are illustrated.  The verb to <em>gramp</em>,\na back formation meaning 'to blow like a grampus,'\ncan be given.  W.E. Collinson has said of it: “This is a\ngood instance of an individual's creation becoming a\nfamily word.” <sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-5\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">5</a></sup> The process of analogy accounts for\n<em>drinkative</em>.  As a writer of 1942 has recounted: “A\nfamily I know has invented a word (I think) which\nalways pleases me—'drinkative'—less objectionable\nthan 'drunken.'  It is probably based upon 'talkative.'”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-6\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-6\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>The change from one part of speech to another\nwas reported by a New Englander in 1908:</p>\n<p>There is hardly a family but has some expressive\nimprovised word.  In my own family 'humbly' reigns\nsupreme.  This is not the adverb of current usage, but\nan adjective, and a cross between 'humble' and 'homely';\nand it was first used to describe our washwoman, who\ntakes such pride in her humbleness, and is of such a\nsuperlative weatherbeaten homeliness, that she needed\nsomething special to express her personality....\n'Humbly' she is, and as 'humbly Mrs. Wheeler' she will\nbe known in our family, while the brother who invented\nthe word quite puffs himself up about it.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-7\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-7\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>Blending, or the formation of portmanteau words,\nis found in other families.  Herbert Quick, the Iowa\nnovelist, in <em>Vandemark's Folly</em> of 1922, put into the\nfictional narration of an old Iowa pioneer the following\nsentence: “I remembered, though, how she had\nskithered back to the carriage.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-8\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-8\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">8</a></sup> Then he added a footnote\nto <em>skithered</em>, attributed to an educated granddaughter\nof the pioneer:</p>\n<p>A family word, to the study of which one would like to\ndirect the attention of the philologists, since traces of it\nare found in the conversation of folk of unsophisticated\nvocabulary outside the Clan van de Marck.  Doubtless\nit is of Yankee origin, and hence old English.  It may,\nof course, be derived according to Alice-in-Wonderland\nprinciples from <em>skip</em> and <em>hither</em> or <em>thither</em> or all three;\nbut the claim is here made that it comes, like monkeys\nand men, from a common linguistic ancestor.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-9\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-9\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>The cleverest of all the family words that have\ncome to my attention is one from Scotland: a celebration\nof Burns's birthday, at which haggis was served,\nwas known by the “sandwich” formation <em>Walp-haggisnicht\n!</em><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-10\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-10\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>Fairly mysterious is the word <em>hoosh-mi</em>, from the\nroyal family of England.  As the Queen's former nanny,\nMarion Crawford, has chronicled:</p>\n<p>The pram...remained in purdah for some years\ntogether with...the hoosh-mi dish.  'Hoosh-mi' is a\npleasant word made up by [Princess] Margaret for the\nnursery mixture of chopped meat, potato and gravy, all\n'hoosh-mied' up together and spoon-fed to its victim.  Later\nthe word was to become part of the schoolroom vocabulary,\nand a mix of any kind was always known as a hoosh-mi. <sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-11\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-11\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Its use is illustrated in a later passage by the nanny:\n“Margaret...has a large round table on which can\nalways be found a lavish clutter.  Letters, invitations,\ndance programs, greeting telegrams—in short, a hooshmi.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-12\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-12\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>Another favorite type of family expression is the\nalphabetical abbreviation or acronym.  One immediately\nthinks of <em>F.H.B.</em>, for <em>Family Hold Back</em> as a\nwarning when an article of food is low but guests are\nnot supposed to know it.  Quite probably this arose as\na family expression, but it broke into general usage\nmany generations ago.  I remember it from my boyhood\nas a subject of joking, and Partridge has marked\nit as from the mid-nineteenth century.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-13\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-13\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">13</a></sup></p>\n<p>Let us turn now to expressions that have their\norigin in chance incidents that have taken place in a\nfamily.  Thus, <em>You ought to see my aunt</em> had currency\nin an American family, as recorded in 1924 by Harry\nG. Paul:</p>\n<p>In another home a dull servant once said, 'If you think\nI am foolish, you ought to see my aunt'; from this grew\na custom of the various members of the family censuring\nthemselves for any unwise act by repeating 'You ought to\nsee my aunt,' an expression which sometimes astonished\nand puzzled any stranger who happened to hear it.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-14\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-14\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>From an Irish family is recorded the idiomatic\nphrase, <em>to sing the hundredth psalm</em>.  As R. A. Stewart\nMacalister, the Irish archeologist, explained it in 1937:</p>\n<p>How could any non-initiate guess that 'to sing the\nhundredth psalm' meant 'to fetch a glass of water'—\nas it does in a family known to me?  If he be admitted\nto the domestic arcana so far as to learn the phrase\nand its meaning, how could he guess the nexus between\nthe two ideas—a chance remark made upon a midsummer\nday, that to allow the heated water to run off from\nthe cold-water tap took about as long a time as it\nwould take to perform the act of piety specified?<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-15\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-15\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">15</a></sup></p>\n<p>Another fruitful source of family words is the\nnaming of various rooms of a house.  Robert Haven\nSchauffler in 1925 recorded the following: “Children,\ntoo, have a sure instinct at times for word coining.\nI know some who christened their play-room 'The\nSquealery.' ”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-16\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-16\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">16</a></sup>  In a family in Essex, the water closet\nwas called <em>the Euphemism</em>.  This arose from the time\nwhen a party of visitors came and one delicate-minded\nlady asked in a whisper, “May we, to use a euphemism,\nwash our hands?”  Thereafter, the lavatory was always\nreferred to as <em>the Euphemism</em>.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-17\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-17\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>The terms such as I have been citing are of small\nuse to the lexicographer.  He would not wish to include\nthem in his inventory, unless they could be shown to\nhave broken into wider currency.  Nevertheless, such\nmaterial should be watched by the lexicologist for its\nvalue in showing tendencies in the language.  The\nfamily is the matrix in which we see the bubbling\nup of linguistic experimentation.  One of the greatest\ngifts that can come to a speaker of a language is the\nsense of freedom to move about among the possible\npatterns that the language provides for him.  This feeling\nof “at-home-ness” develops and flowers in the\nfamily circle.</p>\n<ol start=\"118\">\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<h1></h1>\n<section data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-1\">\n<p>Abridged from “Family Words in English,” by Allen Walker Read,\nAMERICAN SPEECH, February 1962, © copyright Columbia University\nPress. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-2\">\n<p>From a report written by Catherine White. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 2\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-3\">\n<p>New York <em>Post</em>, March 5, 1950, p. 32/I. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 3\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-4\">\n<p><em>I Still Haven't Unpacked</em> (London, 1953), p. 227. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-4\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 4\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-5\">\n<p><em>Contemporary English: a Personal Speech Record</em> (Leipzig, 1927), p. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-5\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 5\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-6\">\n<p><em>Notes &amp; Queries</em>, CLXXXII (1942), 77. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-6\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 6\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-7\">\n<p>“Improvised Words,” <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, CII (1908), 714. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-7\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 7\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-8\">\n<p><em>Vandemark's Folly</em> (Indianapolis, 1922), p. 143. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-8\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 8\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-9\">\n<p><em>Ibid</em>.
