As a dictionary, it emerges as a\nfairly good book, though it contains only about 1100 entries;\nas a source for “origins of sea terms,” it could have been better,\nfor many of the etymologies are speculative.  That is not\nalways Rogers's fault.  Although many terms one might\nexpect to find are lacking, those omissions may be attributed\nto the highly personal nature of the book, borne out by the\nauthor's informal asides (e.g., “Here's one for you!”).</p>\n<p>As an etymologist, Rogers is—albeit confessedly—an\namateur.  For instance, it is hard to understand what is\nmeant by his comment, at <em>aloft</em>, “This word is one of the\nsurprisingly few that seems to have originated in English,” a\nnaive remark at best.  In other cases (e.g., <em>boot top</em>) no etymology\nis given.  Elsewhere (and prevalently) confusing or\nmisleading information is given (e.g., [at <em>brail</em>] “Earlier\nspelled brale, it came from Old French, <em>braile</em>, belt.”): Is\nthe inference to be that the modern English word <em>brail</em> was\nborrowed from Old French in the fifteenth century?  If so,\nthat makes little sense, for one thing because the period generally\nconsigned to Old French does not stretch beyond the\nthirteenth century.  One is given to wonder how Rogers used\nhis sources, for in this particular instance he shows that he\ngleaned information (mainly, I imagine) from <em>Middle English\nSea Terms</em> and the <em>Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology</em>\n(Onions).  It is hard to see how he could have interpreted\neither in such a way as to yield his result.  It would\nappear from other etymologies he records that Rogers copied\nfrom his sources those origins he most fancied as being interesting:\nas no linguist appears among the list of his acknowledgments,\none must assume that he had little professional\nhelp in that quarter.</p>\n<p>More's the pity, for, informal and attractive though it\nis, <em>Origins of Sea Terms</em> cannot be recommended for its\nscholarship.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
