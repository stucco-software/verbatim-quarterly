But the\nAmericans wanted something forceful, so they used the\nGreek word 'bourthes.'  'Bourthes' can be translated in\nmany ways, such as hot air or baloney or a lot of bull.\n...a columnist...wrote that 'bourthes' was 'very expressive\nand to the point, and now that the U.S. Embassy\nhas honored it with its authority, it gains, I believe, special\nimportance and may soon be very widely used.' ” [<em>The\nNew York Times</em>, 31 August 1974]</p>\n<p>Even within English problems can crop up in the\nwriting of lucid, unambiguous prose.

One doesn't announce the etymology of each word\nhe uses in speech or writing.</p>\n<p><em>Mademoiselle</em> for September 1974 published an article\non Eric Partridge's <em>Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional\nEnglish</em> and <em>A Dictionary of the Underworld, British and\nAmerican</em>.</p>\n<p>On the Op-Ed Page of <em>The New York Times</em>, William\nSafire, in an excellent essay on Webster's birthday, notes\nthat at the Senate hearings the word most frequently misspelled\nwas <em>misprision</em>, being replaced by <em>coverup</em>, which\n“had lost its hyphen and thus its virginity,” immediately\nsuggesting a hymen/hyphen play on words.  <em>The Times</em>,\nlike a dutiful parent, still maintains the hyphenated form,\n<em>cover-up</em>, rather than the copulated form, the marriage not\nhaving been consummated....  In the same (sexual) vein,\n<em>The Times Book Review</em> [27 October 1974], in a review of\nPeter De Vries' <em>The Glory of the Hummingbird</em>, included,\nin a “shock of recognition” tone, the phrase, “lovers' loins\n'sweetly hyphenated.' ” (<em>Hyphen</em>, from Greek, meant\n'under one.') [C. J. Tamulonis, <em>Pottsville, Pa</em>.]</p>\n<p>Bill, an American friend of ours with a business in\nBerlin, visited us in the U.S. with his fiancee, a native-born\nGerman girl with just a fair, conversational grasp of English.\nI had picked up a little German as a child, so I asked\nBerta, “Just how can you be sure when to use the polite\nor familiar forms in German?  That 'Sie' and 'du' always\npuzzle me.  Does it depend on age, or family, or rank in\nsociety, or what?”  She started to answer, when I continued,\n“Now if I were all dressed up in Berlin and wanted\nto ask directions of a dirty, old, street-cleaner, would I use\n'Sie' or 'du'?”  Again, before Berta could answer, her fiance\ninterjected, “I think that you'd use 'du' if he's a peon.”\nBerta broke up; gasping with laughter, she finally replied,\n“Bill, what grammatical difference does it make if he's\na-pee-in' in the street or not?!”  Whereupon we all collapsed\nand refilled our steins.
