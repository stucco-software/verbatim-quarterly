Fowkes</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">Yonkers, New York</span></em></p>\n<p><em>Brunch</em> and <em>Mexicali</em> are, as is well known, “blends,”\nintentional combinations of parts of <em>breakfast +\nlunch and Mexico + California)</em>, respectively. These are\ntransparent formations, and it might prove possible to find\nthe original coiners. James Joyce is notorious for his prolific\nblends, which range from the banal to the ingenious (with\nmore of the latter than the former). Not many of his blends\nhave entered the English vocabulary in any lasting way,\nalthough they may intrigue and even delight us. They are\noften bound to the not-too-intelligible context of the individual\nbook (<em>Finnegans Wake</em> more than the others), but\nmany of them can be appreciated out of context, for example:\n<em>Lipoleum (linoleum + Napoleon)</em>; astoneaged\n<em>(astonished + stone age)</em>; <em>madison man (medicine man +\nMadison (Avenue) = advertising man)</em>; <em>roaratorio</em> (a type\nof musical work in which Handel excelled, performed with\ngusto by scores of local choruses); <em>hantitat (hafujnt +\nhabitat</em>, the stamping ground of a particular ghost); <em>anthrapologise\n(anthropology + apologize)</em>; <em>traumaturgid (trauma\n+ German Traum 'dream' + (possibly) dramaturgy +\nturgid)</em>; <em>continuarration (continued + narration)</em>; <em>queenoveire\n(Guinevere + Queen of Eire)</em>; <em>muddlecrass</em> pupils\n(analysis not needed); and, especially relevant here, <em>verbaten</em>\nwords (<em>verbatim + verboten</em>). Joyce's blends are, to\nmy mind, masterful. A member of a church in Mount Vernon,\nN.Y., almost deserves to be ranked with Joyce for one\nblend: in referring to the energetic motions of the choir\nleader, he coined the term <em>hymnastics</em>.</p>\n<p>A great number of blends, some of venerable age, are\nless brilliant but have achieved a relatively secure place in\nthe lexicon. Often they are not as transparent as the ones\njust cited and offer either too many or too few possibilities\nfor analysis. At any rate, writers of dictionaries use\nnumerous question marks in their attempts at explanation.\n<em>Splotch</em>, for example, has been called a blend of <em>spot +\nblotch</em> (but the latter may = <em>blot + patch</em>-or may not).\n<em>Splurge</em> has been explained as a blend of <em>splash + surge</em>.\n<em>Splutter</em> may be <em>splash + sputter</em>, with overtones of <em>mutter</em>,\n<em>utter</em>. But what is <em>splash</em> itself? (Perhaps it doesn't matter-but\nthat yields splatter.) <em>Clash</em> could be a blend of <em>clap\n+ dash</em>; and <em>flash</em> has been said to be from <em>flow + dash</em>, or\n<em>flood + dash</em>, or <em>flame + dash</em>. <em>Sprawl</em> may be <em>spread +\ncrawl</em>; <em>smash</em> can be <em>smack + mash</em>; and <em>trudge</em> is conceivably\n<em>tread + drudge</em> (hardly <em>trot + fudge</em>). There\nseems to be little doubt that smog = <em>smoke + fog</em>.</p>\n<p>All of these blends, or most of them, are probably effective\nas onomatopoeia, but they are otherwise not particularly\ndistinguished. We could call them <em>blands</em>, though I\ndoubt we'd get away with it. I would also include <em>brunch</em>\nand <em>Mexicali</em> (as well as <em>Texarkana</em> and all the rest) under\nthat heading.</p>\n<p>When, however, a sports announcer (Bill Stern) said\nseveral decades ago that some award was <em>symblematic</em> of\nthe highest excellence in college football, he was using a\n<em>blund</em>. That is, it was a blundering combination of the\nelements of <em>symbolic + emblematic</em> with undertones of\n<em>symptomatic</em>, if not other words too, and he was using it\nwith an arrogance that implied assurance that it was an extant\nword.</p>\n<p>Blends come from blenders; blunds are from\nblunder(er)s. I am not sure that sports broadcasts generate\nmore blunds than other sources, but they do seem to be\nhighly productive of them. “The Knicks' <em>dwaning</em> chances”\nwere bewailed a year or two ago by a usually careful\nspeaker (Peter Roberts, radio station WOR, New York), and\nhe did not pause to correct the utterance (presumably a\nblund of <em>dwindling</em> and waning). But sometimes the blund\nis caught aborning and is corrected, cf., e.g., “Scall—er,\ncall—a skycab,” which was not a very promising blund\nanyway. The <em>word floundering</em> must have started as a fishy\nblund (not too infelicitous) <em>for foundering (with blundering</em>,\naccording to the <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em>), but it has\nsurvived and has not completely supplanted the word\n<em>foundering</em> itself.</p>\n<p>A blund can also occur in the semantic realm without\ninvolving telescoping or combining of phonic elements. This\nleads to less dissectible formations. I regard the common\nmisuse of <em>aggravate</em>, in the sense of 'annoy, irk,' (instead of\n'make worse,' etc.) as constituting a sort of blund, resulting\nfrom semiconscious associations with such words as <em>exasperate</em>\n, <em>irritate</em>, and the like. The analysis is risky, for it\ninvolves mind-reading, assuming a mind is present.</p>\n<p><em>When inchoate</em> is used in the sense of “confused, disordered,\nentangled' by even fairly learned colleagues (with,\nhowever, usually no Latin and less Greek), there must be\nsome sort of semantic blund that imparts the sense of\nchaotic and adds it to the meaning 'incipient.'</p>\n<p>I am not sure how <em>lackadaisical</em> acquired the blundering\nsense of 'listless, languid, careless, apathetic,' but there\nare echoes of such words as <em>lax</em>, <em>laxity</em>, <em>lack</em>, <em>lassitude</em>, and\nmaybe <em>lazy days</em> that must have helped to oust the 'lackaday'\nof the original. And <em>connive</em> in its normal misuse may\ninvolve a blund with <em>contrive or conspire</em> (or even <em>confide</em>,\nwith reference to confidence men).</p>\n<p>Years ago, when the Yorkville section of New York City\nwas largely German, I used to eat in a restaurant that had\nGerman cuisine but menus printed in what passed for\nEnglish. Some customers were astonished when they\nordered one item on the menu: <em>shellfish</em>, which turned out\nto be haddock (German <em>Schellfisch</em>). This was a blund, perhaps,\nof English orthographic shape plus German semantics\n(a metaglottal blund, perhaps, but not a flounder).</p>\n<p>When Ira Levin was thinking of a title for what\nbecame his successful play <em>Deathtrap</em>, he briefly contemplated\ncalling it <em>A Better Mousetrap</em>, since it does parody\nAgatha Christie's style a bit (as well as that of one or two\nothers). Agatha's play has, of course, run for well over .a\nquarter of a century in London. Levin decided, however, to\nobserve decent pieté and called his piece <em>Deathtrap</em> instead.\nBoth <em>A Better Mousetrap and Deathtrap</em> are blends—not\nblunds— one with obvious allusion to the superior product\nfor which an avid world will allegedly beat a path to one's\ndoor, as well as with the implication that the new play\nwould surpass Agatha's; the other, less obviously, blending\n<em>Mousetrap</em>, the play, with implications of suspense and terror.\nBrant Newborn (!) in “A Long Life (!) for Deathtrap,”\n<em>Playbill</em>, Oct., 1980, pp. 12-17, informs us that, of all the\nmany places where <em>Deathtrap</em> has played, Miami alone saw\nattendance suffer because the prospective audiences “in that\npredominantly geriatric community” evidently misinterpreted\nthe title in a depressingly subjective way.</p>\n<p><em>Dioressence</em>, the name of a Dior perfume, no doubt a\n“blend” of various ingredients, may be “essentially” a compound\n(if it were an Indian scent, it might be a Tatpurusha),\nbut it emits vague suggestions of <em>diorama</em> or\n<em>diorite</em>, neither of which has any logical association with\n<em>Dioressence</em>—but associations do not need to be logical.</p>\n<p><em>Skinned milk</em> was the term used by the woman next\ndoor years ago for <em>skim milk/skimmed milk</em>. I recall hearing\nmy mother ask the woman why she said “skinned milk,”\nand the reply was, “They skin the fat off it, you see” (and\n<em>skinny</em> is, no doubt, the opposite <em>of fatty</em>). I'm not sure that\nthis qualifies as a blund or is merely a blunder, but it does,\nin a way, blend <em>skim and skin</em>.</p>\n<p>People on radio station WFAS, White Plains, New\nYork, making a conscious effort to pronounce <em>White</em> with\ninitial [hw] (which is, of course, not a characteristic of the\nspeech of the region), more than once have brought us a\n“whether report,” which is a blund of sorts. And <em>The New\nYork Times</em> for October 17, 1980, p. CL, tells us that the\nleaves age, “whither,” and fall. Possibly they “whither\naway.”</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the blends, blands, and blunds\ntreated here fall into the category of Alice's portmanteau\nwords. Some of them seem to originate in Blunderland.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
