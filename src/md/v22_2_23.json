I suppose it doesn't matter all that much whether someone is absent without leave or absent without official leave—in either case, he or she is probably in for a heapa trouble. But, for my two cents' worth, when I was in the U.S. Army, early 1950s (Korea, Land of the Morning Calm, sometimes referred to as Frozen Chosen), I was in a battalion personnel unit and handled daily Morning Reports from each battery. This included manpower accounting. We always saw the term and heard it and used it as “absent without leave.” While we had few or no real instances of AWOL, it was reported daily. The use of <em>WO</em> for 'without' meant—to us, anyway—that a person who was gone, missing, couldn't be found, etc., was absent and had been granted no leave— official, unofficial, or what have you. This was <em>AWOL</em>. There could be leaves of unofficial nature (often called “hip-pocket leave”), but those were not reported as any kind of leave: they compensated a person some time off for a job well done or for a long period in action and were not charged against ordinary leave allowances. But being AWOL was a no-no, whether “official” or “unofficial.”</p>\n<p><em>[Tom S. Reyenga, Del City, Oklahoma]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
