It is basically composed\nof 29 percent Anglo-Saxon and 60 percent\nRomance (including Latin and Greek) words.  The remaining\n20 percent are either invented (<em>laser, bogus,\nsplurge</em>) or have been borrowed from more than 200\nother languages or dialects from Arabic to Zulu.  No\nother national language even comes close to that.  One\nreason for this diversity is the custom of English-speaking\nexplorers and pioneers in a new land to adopt the\nnative name for unfamiliar plants, animals, and\nthings.  Other cultures do not follow this custom.\nWhen the Greeks first saw a huge animal in Egypt,\nthey called it <em>hippopotamus</em>, the Greek word for 'water\nhorse.'  When the Boers first saw a strange animal in\nSouth Africa, they called it <em>aardvark</em>, a Dutch word\nfor 'earth pig.'  The English, however, seeing a large\nbearlike animal in Indo-China, adopted the Nepalese\nname <em>panda</em>; and a strange water mammal was given\nits Javanese name <em>dugong</em>.</p>\n<p>When two peoples speaking different languages\nshare a common border, there is an infiltration of\nwords from one language to the other.  The north border\nof the United States is with Canada, most of whose\npeople share our common English speech.  True, the\nofficial language of the province of Quebec is French;\nand true, we have borrowed a few words from there;\n<em>lacrosse</em>, for example.  But the south border is another\nmatter.  For more than 160 years, since the Anglos arrived\nin Texas, there has been a culture transfer back\nand forth across the Rio Grande.  The process is still\ngoing on.  Fifteen years ago, few people north of San\nAntonio had heard of <em>burritos, fajitas, flautas</em>, or\n<em>chalupas</em>.  Today, thanks to franchise Mexican restaurants,\nthey have become a part of America's vocabulary.\nOther food names that have passed through the\nTexas pipeline into common usage are <em>chile, enchilada,\ntaco, tamale, tortilla, fríjol, frito, picante,\njalapeño, nacho, mescal, tequila</em>, and <em>margarita</em>.  It\nmay be interesting to note the Spanish borrowed <em>chile,\ntamale, mescal</em>, and <em>mesquite</em> from the indigenous Indians\nbefore passing them on to us.</p>\n<p>Let us now pass on to the names of some clothing\nitems that Texans borrowed and then passed on to the\nrest of the country: <em>sombrero, mantilla, poncho, rebozo,\nserape</em>, and <em>huarache</em>.  A number of animals and\nvegetables followed the same route: <em>avocado</em> from\n<em>aguacate; mesquite; sapodilla</em> from <em>zapote; guayule;\ncoyote; armadillo; ocelot</em> from <em>ocelote; chaparral</em>; and\n<em>javalina</em> from <em>jabalina</em>.  Since cattle ranching is common\nto both sides of the border, it should come as no\nsurprise that there has been an exchange of ranch-related\nwords: <em>lariat</em> from <em>la reata; bronco; lasso</em> from\n<em>lazo; rodeo; chaps</em> from <em>chaparreras; charro; hackamore</em>\nfrom <em>jáquima; mustang</em> from <em>mestengo</em>; and\n<em>quirt</em> from <em>cuerda</em> or <em>cuarta</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a miscellaneous group of words.\n<em>Alamo</em>, the site of the Texas defeat by Santa Ana;\n<em>hoosegow</em> from <em>juzgado</em> 'court'; <em>dinero</em> 'money,' a\nSpanish corruption of the Latin <em>denarius; macho</em>,\nfrom the same root as <em>machete</em>: he who wields a machete\nmust be skillful and powerful, hence the word\nhas come to mean 'virile' and its associated noun, <em>machismo</em>,\n'virility.'  A <em>gringo</em>, from <em>griego</em> 'Greek,' is one\nwhose speech “sounds like Greek to me.”  The story that\nit comes from the song “Green Grow the Lilacs,” said\nto have been sung at San Jacinto, is an example of folk\netymology.  Let us not forget <em>marijuana</em> which is simply\n'Mary Jane' in Mexico, or <em>cucaracha</em>, the 'cockroach'\nthat entered English via a popular song.</p>\n<p>Some time ago, Texans picked up a speech habit\nthat is being acquired by the rest of the country.  When\nTexans, in particular South Texans, want to emphasize\na statement, they often use a Spanish word.  If they\nwant to be emphatic about a large undertaking, they\nmight say, “I'm going to do it all!  The entire thing!  The\nwhole <em>enchilada!</em>”  About someone who is in complete\ncharge of a project, they could say, “He runs things\ncompletely!  He's the boss!  <em>Número uno!</em>”  Then there is\nnegation: “I had nothing to do with that!  Nothing at\nall!  <em>Nada!</em>”  And to request confirmation, they might\nwell say “You do it exactly this way!  You'd better do it\nright!  <em>Comprende</em>?”</p>\n<p>Texas has contributed a few good words to the\nEnglish language without any help from Spanish or\nMexican.  During the 1850s, a Texas lawyer acquired a\nsmall herd of cattle on Matagorda Island.  Because he\nknew little about the cattle business and cared less, he\nnever got around to branding his stock.  That man was\nSamuel Maverick.  As time passed, cattlemen began\ncalling all unbranded cattle <em>mavericks</em>.  The word\nspread throughout Texas and into English generally.\nAnd its meaning expanded to mean any nonconformist.\nThen there are the <em>cattalo</em> and the <em>beefalo</em>, crosses\nbetween cattle and buffalo, first attempted in Texas.  A\n<em>jackalope</em> is an imaginary horned rabbit, reputedly\ninhabiting West Texas.</p>\n<p>These fifty words that have entered English after a\nbrief sojourn in Texas can be found in almost any dictionary.\nThat is to say, about one of every thousand\nEnglish words came into the language via Texas.  If the\naverage American uses from three to five thousand\ndifferent words each day, the chances are everybody in\nthis country will use three or more Texican words.</p>",
