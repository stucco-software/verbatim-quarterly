Manser and Nigel D. Turton, (Penguin, 1987), xxiii + 839 pp.</p>\n<p>This is an interesting dictionary, but it must be\nemphasized at the outset that it is British and is unlikely\nto be sold in the U.S.A. in its present form.  The\nalphabetical entries are pretty much what one would\nexpect to find in a chunky paperback: the definitions\nare brief, but to the point, example contexts are given\nfor many of them, short etymologies abound; for a\nquick reference, the book serves well.  The pronunciations\nare given in the International Phonetic Alphabet:\nthe IPA, universally employed in European dictionaries,\nis relatively easy to use, though most Americans\nare accustomed to the respelling systems that have long\nappeared in dictionaries made in the U.S.</p>\n<p>What sets the book apart from others are the vignetted\netymologies and usage notes that appear on\nevery page.  Some of these are quite full (compared\nwith the normally terse lexicographic treatment in this\nkind of book) and are generally interesting.  Opening\nthe book in the middle we find the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>p. 432: <em>maudlin</em> - sense refinement and etymology.<br>\np. 433: <em>mausoleum</em> - etymology.<br>\np. 434: <em>measles</em> - note on <em>German measles</em> and\ncomment (with examples) of\nmedical synonyms, e.g., baldness = alopecia.<br>\n<em>meat</em> - discussion of historical meaning\nchange.<br>\np. 435: <em>media</em> - usage note on singular <em>vs</em>.\nplural.<br>\np. 437: note on <em>don't mention it!</em>  and other\nstereotyped acknowledgments.\n<em>mentor</em> - discussion of etymology.<br>\np. 439: <em>meter</em> or <em>metre</em> - (British) spelling practice\nof measurement unit <em>vs</em>.\ndevice.<br>\np. 440: <em>mews</em> - etymological discussion.<br>\np. 441: <em>militate/mitigate</em> - distinctions.<br>\np. 443: <em>milliner</em> - etymology note.<br>\n<em>mind your p's and q's</em> - sense embellishment\nand etymology note.<br>\np. 443: <em>miniature</em> - etymology note.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, in a dozen pages, a baker's dozen of\n“panels” is provided.  These range from useful to interesting\nand do much to enhance the browsing features\nof the dictionary.  The over-all variety is greater than\nthat found in these few pages and goes a long way\ntoward presenting in a form far more palatable than\nthat encountered in ordinary dictionary entries the\nkinds of information that many people seek from dictionaries\nbut seldom find because they are compelled\nto wade through a morass of ugly, complicated typography\nand boring, irrelevant matter.  The style is informal\nand user-friendly, and the material should appeal\nto students and general users alike.  Entries discussed\ncarry a reference to the appropriate panel.  I was disappointed\nby the absence of a panel on <em>will/shall</em> and\nby the failure to mention, under <em>would/should</em> some of\nthe “<em>will/shall</em>” aspects of that pair (e.g., <em>I should like\nto go/I would like to go</em>—that is, not the 'ought' sense\nof <em>should</em>, which is adequately covered).</p>\n<p>All things considered—space available, readership\nlevel, etc.—the special features are very well done and\nwill do much to increase the user's awareness of and\ninterest in some of the more engaging aspects of the\nlanguage.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
