Times</em> these past years did not fill me with glee, for\nI always thought them somewhat superficial.  Whether or\nnot they have been reedited for publication in this collection,\nI cannot say, but I resoundingly announce my complete\n<em>volte-face</em>: these are excellent.  Although the professional\nlinguist's writings (as in VERBATIM) will reflect\nhis own opinions, hypotheses, and so forth, the reporter\nmust suppress his own opinions in favor of those of his\ninterviewees.  Shenker is expert at the technique; he writes\nsympathetically, intelligently, articulately, and good-humoredly\nabout a subject that clearly fascinates him--\nlanguage--and about the people engaged in its study and\nartistic pursuit.</p>\n<p>There are 67 pieces in this volume of which 24 deal\nwith language directly, sometimes in its various guises as\ncommunication.  Included among these are articles on\nAmerican English, British English, dictionaries, style, children's\nspeech, and onomastics.  Each is associated with an\ninterview with a practitioner in the field--Allen Walker\nRead, Robert W. Burchfield, Frederic G. Cassidy, Roman\nJakobson, Noam Chomsky; each examines a different facet\nof language.</p>\n<p>The other 43 articles are entirely relevant, as well.  It is\nengaging to read about Perelman, Nabokov, Van Doren,\nSinger, E. B. White, Flanner, Hellman, Ionesco, Beckett,\nand others who are so deeply involved in the artistic applications\nof a subject treated by linguists with such scientific\naplomb.  Even Groucho is there, and rightly so, for if his\npunning isn't the ultimate art, much of Groucho's humor\ncan be traced to his extraordinary ability to expose common\noccurrences and situations by singling out their more\nludicrous characteristics and, in doing so, to make us see--\nvia language—the foibles of our behavior.</p>\n<p>Although we can recommend <em>Words and Their Masters</em>\nas a gift for any occasion, we urge that you be selfish—at\nleast this once—and get a copy for yourself: it will be a\nrewarding indulgence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/stx_Verbatim_The_Language_Quarterly_v1n2_1974-09\">Internet Archive copy of this issue</a></p>",
