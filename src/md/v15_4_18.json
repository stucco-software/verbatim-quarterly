A verb/noun\nentry: to tough out a storm, that is, to <em>weather\nweather</em>.  More doubles, minus definitions, are: <em>cozy\ncozy, March march, short short, fair fair</em>, and so on.</p>\n<p>Our rules for playing are: capitalized words or\nproper names are allowed, but redundant entries are\nnot; <em>slick slick</em> does not qualify.  Nor do hyphenated\nphrases, such as <em>go-go, no-no</em>, which are merely intensification.\nThe two words must be identical in spelling,\nbut not in capitalization.  However, players might well\nmake their own rules.</p>\n<p>This game was invented as 'More matter for a May\nmorning' when my wife and I drove last month from\nWest Texas to Hamilton, Montana, a goodly distance,\nbe assured.  The scenery was not always breathtaking,\nso a new word game (verbal, no paraphernalia) was\nneeded to keep us awake.  To honor the source of its\ninspiration, should we perhaps entitle it “Bardling,” or\nhow about “Bardoubling”?  Robert D. Anson</p>\n<p>According to <em>The Times</em> [19 May 1988], Maria\nTandy immigrated to Britain from Gyomaendrod,\nHungary, in 1938 to work as a servant.  Within a short\ntime, her employer had been sent to India, costing her\nthe position, and she learned of the death of her\nmother.  The shock was severe enough to strike her\ndumb, and she was committed to a London hospital.\nWhen she recovered her power of speech, her English\nwas so bad that she could not make herself understood,\nand she languished in the hospital for almost 40\nyears—till recently, when the hospital began to make\narrangements to close and move her elsewhere.  An\ninterpreter was called in, investigated her background\nand story, and discovered that some of her sisters still\nlived in Hungary.  Miss Tandy, now 78, will rejoin her\nfamily to live out her years.</p>\n<h2></h2>",
