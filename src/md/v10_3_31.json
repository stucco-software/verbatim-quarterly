The most usual sense of <em>acronym</em> is 'a word formed\nfrom the initial letters of other words, as NATO, radar' (<em>Oxford\nAmerican Dictionary</em>, 1980).  The emphasis is on <em>word</em>, which\nmakes it necessary for an acronym to be capable of pronunciation,\nas distinct from other abbreviations which are pronounced\nletter by letter, such as DC, OR, etc. as quoted by Mr.\nLederer.</p>\n<p>One of the leading tools which help the reader faced by\nthe ever-growing number of English acronyms and related\nterms is Crowley's <em>Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations\nDictionary</em> (The Gale Research Co. of Detroit).</p>\n<p>In the preface to the 8th edition the following useful\nexplanation of their approach to the three terms is given:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An <em>acronym</em> is composed of the initial letters or parts\nof a compound term.  It is usually <em>read or spoken as a\nsingle word</em>, rather than letter by letter.  Examples\ninclude RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) and\nLASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission\nof Radiation).</p>\n<p>An <em>initialism</em> is also composed of the initial letters or\nparts of a compound term but is generally <em>verbalized\nletter by letter</em>, rather than as a single “word.”  Examples\ninclude PO (Post Office) and RPM (Revolutions\nper Minute).</p>\n<p>An <em>abbreviation</em> is a shortened form of a word or\nwords that does not follow the formation of either of\nthe above.  Examples include Apr (April), Ph. D. (Doctor\nof Philosophy), and Dr. (Doctor).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[N. H. Behr, Ramat-Gan, Israel]</em></p>",
