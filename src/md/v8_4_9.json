I am not for a moment suggesting that such\nterms as “syncopated” should be used in a book for children\n(and they could probably be avoided, to advantage, in books\nfor adults, too), but I do think that the authors (or was it the\nproofreaders?)  should have attended better to their sources.\nOne other matter that crops up as a continual source of\nannoyance in books written by amateurs and based on evidence\nadduced in, for instance, the <em>Oxford English Dictionary:</em>\nthe earliest citation given in the <em>OED</em> is not necessarily—and\ncertainly not probably—the first time a given word was used,\nmerely the earliest written evidence that <em>OED's</em> citation readers\nwere able to find for a form.  Thus, it is probably inaccurate\nto date words as the authors have: “It was not until the 17th\ncentury that <em>cracked</em> or <em>crazy</em> was used about people,” “In the\nlate part of the 13th century, the word <em>[scyrte]</em> divided into\n<em>shirt</em> and <em>skirt,” “Car</em> has meant a 'wheeled vehicle'... since\nthe middle of the 14th century,” and so on.  Admittedly,\ncontinual hedging and qualification make for a dull book, but a\nnote in a foreword could absolve many authors from the onus\nof commitment to unattested scholarship.  Among the sources\ncredited is <em>Fowler's Modern English Usage,</em> “especially the\nentry of <em>irrelevant</em>.”  That entry does not appear in this book;\nperhaps it was deemed to be a self-referring word.</p>\n<p>—<em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
