It often happens\nthat a word, though negative in form, imparts a quite\npositive quality to the word it modifies.  This is not surprising in\nwords like <em>unforgettable</em> (to <em>forget</em> is to <em>fail</em> to remember), or\n<em>unmitigated</em> (to <em>mitigate</em> is to <em>lessen</em>—a negative operation), or\n<em>unflagging</em> (to <em>flag</em> is to <em>fall off</em> in vigor—likewise a negative\nact), or <em>untrammeled</em> (to trammel is to <em>restrain</em>—an action\nnegative in effect); and there are <em>undoubtedly</em> (there's another\none for you!) many more in this category.  As in mathematics,\nthe negative of a negative is a positive, but remember: two\nwrongs don't make a right.</p>\n<p>A man of <em>unimpeachable</em> character, of <em>unassailable</em> integrity,\nof <em>unquestioned</em> probity, of <em>undisputed</em> honesty, who\nalways speaks the <em>unvarnished</em> truth with <em>uncompromising</em>\nadherence to the straight and narrow and <em>incalculable</em> energy\nis, you will admit, a far from negative chap.</p>\n<p>And one is being quite affirmative in singing the praises of\na face of <em>irresistible</em>, nay <em>ineffable</em> beauty, in gazing with\n<em>unalloyed</em> pleasure at the <em>immutable</em> mountains and the <em>immemorial</em>\nelms and the wonders of the <em>changeless</em> progress of the\nseasons, in facing an <em>implacable</em> foe or a <em>relentless</em> adversary, in\ndeploring the <em>indescribable</em> damage wrought by a hurricane, in\npredicting <em>ineluctable</em> progress, <em>inescapable</em> achievement, and\n<em>inevitable</em> success, in denouncing an <em>unconscionable</em> rascal,\nadmiring <em>unbounded</em> enthusiasm, exclaiming about the vastness\nof the <em>untrod</em> wastes, and extolling the virtues of a pure,\n<em>unadulterated</em> product, <em>untouched</em> by human hands.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, those well-known adjectives, negative\nin meaning as well as form, whose positives, though (to the\nsurprise of many) they do exist, are practically never seen:\n<em>uncouth, unkempt</em> and <em>disgruntled</em> (sounds like a law firm).\nThere is a group without positive forms at all: <em>disheveled</em>, from\nOld French <em>descheveler</em> 'to mess up (someone's) hair'; <em>ineluctable;\ninordinate (ordinate</em> is a noun, a term in mathematics);\n<em>intransigent; intrepid; inviolate (violate</em> exists, but only as a\nverb); <em>nondescript; nonpareil;</em> and a very common, if hidden,\nnegative with a very positive meaning: <em>immense</em>, from Latin\nprefix <em>im</em>- plus <em>mensus</em>, past participle of <em>metiri</em> 'to measure';\nand here, too, there must be many more.  An exhausting effort\nis not always exhaustive.</p>\n<p>There is also a class of negative/positive pairs, involving\nvarious parts of speech, that, in current usage, are not opposite\nin meaning.  In the following examples, the true antonym\nappears in parentheses: <em>disaffection/affection</em> (loyalty); <em>dissimulate/simulate</em>\n(act openly); <em>immemorial/memorial</em> (within\nmemory); <em>nonentity/entity</em> (V.I.P.); <em>disinterested/interested</em>\n(biased)—(<em>uninterested</em> and <em>interested</em> are true antonyms);\n<em>nonobjective/objective</em>—as applied to art—(representational);\n<em>nonsectarian/sectarian</em>—as applied to schools—(denomi-national).</p>\n<p>The negative forms fall into a number of classes: those\nintroduced by the prefixes <em>a-</em>, taken from the classical Greek\nalpha privative (<em>amoral, apolitical</em>); <em>dis</em>- (<em>disingenuous, disinterested</em>);\n<em>in- (incongruous, inescapable</em>), which sometimes takes\nthe form <em>il</em>- (<em>illiberal, illicit</em>), <em>im</em>- (<em>impossible, improbable</em>) or <em>ir</em>-(<em>irresistible,\nirresponsible, irrational); mis- (mislike, mistrust</em>);\n<em>non</em>- (<em>nonexistent, nonobjective</em>); and most commonly, <em>un</em>(<em>unbelievable,\nunquestionable</em>); and those ending with the\nsuffix -<em>less</em> (<em>merciless, reckless</em>).  <em>Mis</em>- is rare as a negative prefix;\nits normal use is rather to indicate error or impropriety.  Thus, a\n<em>misbegotten</em> son of man is nonetheless begotten; <em>misbehavior</em> is\nstill behavior, if the wrong kind; a <em>mistrial</em> is still a trial, though\nterminated without conclusion; a <em>misprint</em> is not usually a\nblank; and a <em>misdeed</em> is indeed a deed, though a wrongful one.\n<em>Mistrust</em> is an example of the small group where the <em>mis-</em> spells\nnegation.</p>\n<p>There is at least one case where the negative form is\nalmost never used while the positive is in everyone's vocabulary:\n<em>misknow</em>, believe it or not, is a valid, if ignored English\nword.  But to get back to our original point, here are some\nsamples of adjectives whose negative forms are in much greater\nuse than their positives:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>illicit<br>\nimmutable<br>\nimperturbable<br>\nimpervious<br>\nimplacable<br>\nimponderable<br>\nincalculable<br>\ninclement<br>\nincongruous<br>\nincontrovertible\nineffable<br>\ninescapable<br>\ninevitable<br>\ninexplicable<br>\ninextricable<br>\ninnocuous<br>\ninnumerable<br>\ninscrutable<br>\ninsuperable<br>\nnonexistent<br>\nunassuming<br>\nunbeknown(st)<br>\nunblinking<br>\nunbounded<br>\nunbridled<br>\nuncalled-for<br>\nunceremonious<br>\nuncompromising</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But here we must stop, inviting the reader to ramble\nthrough the unabridged to find hundreds more to add to the\nlist.  Perhaps you might also enjoy the exercise of changing the\nnegative words in the following silly sentence to their positive\nforms and see what you come up with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ungainly fellow, despite his unheard-of unnerving\nand unsettling experience, managed in some unfathomable\nway to behave unimpeachably in his uncompromising,\nunswerving, dauntless determination to put an\nunceremonious end to the indescribably unconscionable,\nnay unmentionable misdeeds of his implacable antagonist.\nI wish him luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To end on a positive note, I trust that this inimitable,\nincomparable piece of deathless prose will prove to be a\npeerless, priceless gem of inestimable value, and of incalculable\nassistance to you in the endless days ahead.</p>",
