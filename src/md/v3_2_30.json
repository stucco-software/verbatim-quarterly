Kerr</span></h1>\n<p>It is true that the <em>Authorized King James Version</em> of the Bible uses both <em>ghost</em> and <em>spirit</em>, and that modern English usage prefers the latter (except in the phrase “to give up the ghost”), as noted by Mabel C. Donnelly [III, 1].  But the biblical vocabulary for psychic, spiritual, mental, and emotional states is vastly more complicated, and rich, than a single citation (Mark 1:8, 10) can suggest.</p>\n<p>Biblical dictionaries on the subject can be exasperating, and concordances soon reveal the complexities involved. Hebrew uses at least two “spirit” words (<em>ruach</em> and <em>nephesh</em>), while Greek has three (<em>pneuma, psyche,</em> and <em>nous</em>).  But the use of these words in the Bible often seems arbitrary, and so translation into English can be confusing. In addition to <em>spirit</em> and <em>ghost</em>, we can have <em>wind, life, breath, soul, mind,</em> etc.  Try this text on your aeolian harp: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind...” (Luke 10:27).</p>\n<p>Just to add further to the verbal maze, the biblical view of personality was psychosomatic (and distinct from Platonic dualism--“the body is the prison-house of the soul”).  So in both the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, what we would call psychic or spiritual states are freely ascribed to physical organs and other parts of the human anatomy.  Blood, heart, head, hands, feet, eyes, breast, mouth, reins (kidneys), liver, bowels, etc. are all invoked as ways for expressing mental, spiritual, and emotional states.  Here the <em>Authorized King James Version,</em> in my view, is much to be preferred to the more pallid modern English translations.  I list some examples:</p>\n<p>{{&lt; column &gt;}}\n{{}}Authorized King James{{}}\n{{}}American Revised Standard{{}}\n{{}}Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.  (Psalm 26:2)    {{}}</p>\n<p>{{}}Prove me, O Lord, and try me; test my heart and my mind.{{}}</p>\n<p>{{}}My beloved put in his hand  by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.  (Song of Songs 5:4)   {{}}</p>\n<p>{{}}My beloved put his hand to the latch, and my heart was thrilled within me.{{}}</p>\n<p>{{}}Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth....  (Lam. 2:11){{}}</p>\n<p>{{}}My eyes are spent with weeping; my soul is in tumult; my heart is poured out in grief.{{}}</p>\n<p>{{}}Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering.  (Col. 3:12){{}}</p>\n<p>{{}}Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience.{{}}\n{{}}{{}}\n{{&lt; /column &gt;}}</p>\n<p>Two minor matters: (1) <em>Holy Ghost</em> is still preferred (to <em>Holy Spirit</em>) among many in the so-called Holiness churches, including--so I'm told--the serpent-handlers of West Virginia.  Perhaps in this instance we have the association of snake-bite as the testing of faith (and victory over death) with <em>ghost</em> as the accepted word for 'the soul of a deceased person' (<em>OED</em>).  (2) <em>Giving up the ghost</em> must be related to common expression of concern when someone sneezes.  <em>God bless you!</em> and <em>Gesundheit!</em> are holdovers from the primitive belief that a person's vital breath (spirit, wind, life, soul, ghost) is expelled during a sneeze. <em>[Hugh T.
