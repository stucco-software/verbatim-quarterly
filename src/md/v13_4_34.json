Devlin, Westport Point, Massachusetts</em></p>\n<p>When the century and I were young, magazines\nand newspapers made us familiar with writers and\nillustrators named Albert Payson Terhune, Kate\nDouglas Wiggin, James Montgomery Flagg, and\nCharles Dana Gibson (of the Gibson Girls).  It seemed\nto me then an amiable but stodgy fashion of the times,\na pointless affectation.  But now a closer look reveals a\nmultitude of three-named people, writers, artists, philosophers,\neven business tycoons, endowers of art\ngalleries, museum wings and concert series, even\nsportsmen, spanning the last century and reaching\ninto our own day—from, you might say, John Quincy\nAdams to Jack Kent Cooke.</p>\n<p>Adams and Francis Scott Key were among the\nforerunners, I suppose; but there seems to have been a\nflood of them during the High Victorian Age, and\nmany since then.  You can spot at once Harriet Beecher\nStowe, Julia Ward Howe, Henry Wadsworth Longfel-low,\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier, Henry David Thoreau,\nJohn James Audubon, Edgar Allan Poe, to name obvious\nAmerican examples.  My Beginner's list contains\n109 trinomials.</p>\n<p>If this thing is worth investigating, you can start\nby asking vague general questions: what was the\nmotive for calling yourself Ralph Waldo Emerson,\ninstead of plain Ralph Emerson?  Or Louisa May\nAlcott, James Fenimore Cooper, John Singer Sargent,\nJames McNeill Whistler, Edward Everett Hale, Helen\nHunt Jackson, Joel Chandler Harris, Mary Baker\nEddy, Frances Hodgson Burnett, William Dean\nHowells, Frank Lloyd Wright?  What were the\nimpulses at work?  Were they dynastic pride, or desire\nfor distinction, or feminism, or compliance with custom,\nor transcendental thinking?</p>\n<p>Across the Atlantic, of course, family or dynastic\npride were in full control of many name-combinations,\nbut these were generally of the double-barreled\nkind: Quiller-Couch, Baring-Gould, Granville-Barker.\nSometimes the middle name without hyphen\nwas used as though the hyphen were there: Conan\nDoyle, Vaughan Williams—a sort of invisible hyphenation.\nHowever, the hyphenates are a separate and\nspecial branch of the species.  The de-hyphenated\nforms were useful to ladies who were in the public\neye, usually for literary reasons.  They could tack their\nhusband's name to their father's, as did Miss Barrett\nand Miss Wollstonecraft, and have the best of both\nworlds.</p>\n<p>It would take more time than it is worth to chart\nthe ebb and flow of trinomials by lining up names in\norder of dates of birth.  But it does seem that after the\nVictorian flood there was a lesser surge that came up\nto the doorstep of the 1980s.  To the ones I mentioned\nabove you can add, with almost no effort, Edger Lee\nMasters, James Whitcomb Riley, Joseph Wood\nKrutch, Samuel Eliot Morison, Marjorie Kinnan\nRawlings, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Katherine Anne\nPorter, Alice Duer Miller, William Randolph Hearst,\nAlexander Graham Bell, Harry Emerson Fosdick, to\nname some of the Americans.  And of course Franklin\nDelano Roosevelt.  He rather spans the gap between\nthe earlier and later groups of three-namers.  The later\ngroup makes the venerable custom seem quite new\nand trendy: Alan Jay Lerner, Robert Russell Bennett,\nMichael Tilson Thomas, Joyce Carol Oates.</p>\n<p>However, when you jot down even a beginner's\nlist of trinomials, including the worthies and notables\nof the last century and a half, you begin to wonder\nwho is left.  The great exceptions stand out by contrast—Charles\nDickens, Edith Wharton, William\nJames, Anthony Trollope, Ernest Hemingway, Alistair\nCooke....</p>\n<p>This idle but engrossing pastime led me to the\nother principle that has been at work on both sides of\nthe Atlantic: two-initialism, which combines austerity\nand ambiguity.  We know that Eliot's first name was\nTom, but we're not really supposed to call him anything\nmore than T.S.  Who knows, off-hand, the first\ntwo, or three, names of P.D. James, M.M. Kaye, M.\nF.K. Fisher, C.V. Wedgwood, E.M. Delafield, R.\nM. Delderfield, E.L. Doctorow, G.K. Chesterton,\nC.S. Forester, E.M. Forster, I.M. Pei, P.G. Wodehouse,\nW.H. Auden, E.B. White, O. Henry, e.e.\ncummings, O.J. Simpson, S.J. Perelman, S.N. Behrman,\nor even P.T. Barnum and H.L. Mencken?  Not\nto mention L.L. Bean.</p>\n<p>There's a special category of those who need no\nmore than three bare initials to be recognized: F.D.\nR., L.B.J., J.F.K., H.H.H., F.P.A., G.B.S.  I\nthink of two two-letter persons who need no more: T.\nR. and E.T.  Unless H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) qualifies.\nEven more minimal are the Irish poet George William\nRussell who reduced himself to AE, and Arthur\nQuiller-Couch who nom-de-plumed himself Q.</p>\n<p>A broad middle ground, of course, is occupied by\nthe combination of first name and initial: David O.\nSelznick, Franklin P. Adams, Jean M. Auel, James M.\nCain.  But this doesn't seem to prove anything.  Except\npossibly that the users have struck a happy balance\nbetween family pride and reliance on their own\nachievement.</p>\n<p>Is all this trivia, or social study?  For all I know,\nsomeone has already published a thesis on the subject.\nIf so, I don't think I want to read it.</p>\n<p>When I sign my name I itch to spell out the second,\na family name to be proud of.  But modesty prevails,\nand I join the broad middle band noted above.</p>\n<p>A beginner's list of three-part names, British and\nAmerican, mainly from the last century but with a\nsprinkling of contemporaries:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alan Jay Lerner<br>\nAlbert Payson Terhune<br>\nAlexander Graham Bell<br>\nAlfred North Whitehead<br>\nAlice Duer Miller<br>\nAndrew Lloyd Webber<br>\nArthur Conan Doyle<br>\nArthur Wing Pinero<br>\nBen Ames Williams<br>\nCarrie Jacobs Bond<br>\nCatherine Drinker Bowen<br>\nCharles Dana Gibson<br>\nCharles Dudley Warner<br>\nClare Booth Luce<br>\nCornelia Otis Skinner<br>\nDante Gabriel Rossetti<br>\nEarl Derr Biggers<br>\nEdgar Allan Poe<br>\nEdgar Lee Masters<br>\nEdgar Rice Burroughs<br>\nEdward Arlington Robinson<br>\nEdward Everett Hale<br>\nEdward Everett Horton<br>\nEleanor Naylor Dana<br>\nElizabeth Gurley Flynn<br>\nElla Wheeler Wilcox<br>\nErnest Thompson Seton<br>\nFinlay Peter Dunne<br>\nFrances Hodgson Burnett<br>\nFrances Parkinson Keyes<br>\nFrancis Scott Key<br>\nFrank Lloyd Wright<br>\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt<br>\nGeorge Bernard Shaw (aka GBS)<br>\nHarriet Beecher Stowe<br>\nHarry Emerson Fosdick<br>\nHarry Leon Wilson<br>\nHelen Gurley Brown<br>\nHelen Hunt Jackson<br>\nHenry Arthur Jones<br>\nHenry David Thoreau<br>\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow<br>\nHerbert Beerbohm Tree<br>\nIsaac Bashevis Singer<br>\nJack Kent Cooke<br>\nJames Branch Cabell<br>\nJames Elroy Flecker<br>\nJames Fenimore Cooper<br>\nJames McNeill Whistler<br>\nJames Montgomery Flagg<br>\nJames Russell Lowell<br>\nJames Truslow Adams<br>\nJames Whitcomb Riley<br>\nJessie Wilcox Smith<br>\nJoel Chandler Harris<br>\nJohn Alden Carpenter<br>\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier<br>\nJohn Hay Whitney<br>\nJohn James Audubon<br>\nJohn Maynard Keynes<br>\nJohn Quincy Adams<br>\nJohn Singer Sargent<br>\nJoseph Wood Krutch<br>\nJoyce Carol Oates<br>\nJulia Ward Howe<br>\nKate Douglas Wiggin<br>\nKatherine Anne Porter<br>\nKatherine Lee Bates<br>\nLogan Pearsall Smith<br>\nLouisa May Alcott<br>\nMargaret Chase Smith<br>\nMarjorie Kinnan Rawlings<br>\nMartin Luther King<br>\nMary Baker Eddy<br>\nMary Ellen Chase<br>\nMary Russell Mitford<br>\nMaud Touzy Fangel<br>\nMichael Tilson Thomas<br>\nOliver Wendell Holmes<br>\nRalph Vaughan Williams<br>\nRalph Waldo Emerson<br>\nRobert Louis Stevenson<br>\nRobert Penn Warren<br>\nSamuel Eliot Morison<br>\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge<br>\nSarah Delano Roosevelt<br>\nSheila Kaye Smith (or does she John Philip Sousa hyphenate?)<br>\nSylvia Townsend Warner<br>\nThomas Babington Macaulay<br>\nThomas Love Peacock<br>\nWalter Savage Landor<br>\nWilliam Butler Yeats (aka W.B.)<br>\nWilliam Carlos Williams<br>\nWilliam Jennings Bryan<br>\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison<br>\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray<br>\nWilliam Randolph Hearst</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A beginner's list of those who are known best, or only,\nby their initials:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A.A.
