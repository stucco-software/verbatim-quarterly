My guess is that\nall ten of them will know <em>homonym</em>, fewer than half will be\nfamiliar with <em>homograph</em>, and possibly one or two may recognize\n<em>heteronym</em>.  If you get a higher ratio of correct responses to\n(2) and (3), you were cheating—that is, you took your survey at\na Mensa meeting or during a lexicographers' convention.</p>\n<p><em>Heteronym</em> is not even recognized by <em>Webster's Third New\nInternational Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged)</em>,\nthough the supposedly definitive “Webster 3” really\nought to be ashamed.  One does find the term defined with\nreasonable accuracy in two less compendious desk dictionaries:\n<em>Webster's New World Dictionary (Second College Edition)</em> and\nthe <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</em>.\nThe former gives <em>heteronym</em> as “a word with the same spelling\nas another but with a different meaning and pronunciation (Ex:\n<em>tear</em>, drop of water from the eye, <em>tear</em>, to rip)”; the latter says,\n“one of two or more words that have identical spellings but\ndifferent meanings and pronunciations; for example, <em>row</em> (a\nline) and <em>row</em> (a fight).”  What is lacking in both definitions is\nthe further requirement that “pure” heteronyms be words of\ndiffering origin.</p>\n<p>I first became aware of heteronyms in 1969 when I wrote\nan article on “Homographs and Pseudo-Homographs” for\nWORD WAYS: <em>The Journal of Recreational Linguistics</em>.  At that\ntime I had “discovered” a grand total of ten heteronymous\npairs of words.  Since then—with valuable assistance from my\nwife, especially, and from colleagues at Long Beach City\nCollege—I have added substantially to my lists in all three\nword-categories: homonyms, homographs, and heteronyms.\nDoubtless the following augmented list of heteronyms (along\nwith some pairs I have arbitrarily designated as “quasi-heteronyms”)\nis still far from complete:</p>\n<p><em>I.  Pure Heteronyms</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1)  <em>agape</em> (a) AG-a-pee 'a primitive Christian love-feast';\n(b) a-GAPE 'full of wonder; amazed.'</p>\n<p>(2)  <em>acedia</em> (a) a-SEE-dee-ya 'spiritual ennui; apathy'; (b)\nASS-uh-dee-ya 'kind of fish.'</p>\n<p>(3)  <em>bass</em> (a) 'kind of fish'; rhymes with <em>lass</em>; (b) 'singer,\nbass viol, etc.'; rhymes with <em>face</em>.</p>\n<p>(4)  <em>bow</em> (a) 'rainbow, weapon for propelling arrows,\netc.'; (b) 'front end of a ship'; rhymes with <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p>(5)  <em>buffet</em> (a) BUFF-et 'bang about'; (b) buf-FAY 'sideboard,\nrefreshment table, etc.'</p>\n<p>(6)  <em>bustier</em> (a) BUST-ee-yer 'more bosomy'; (b) BUST-ee-YAY\n'garment.'</p>\n<p>(7)  <em>cave</em> (a) 'cavern'; rhymes with <em>rave</em>; (b) CAY-vee;\nCAH-vay; from Latin 'beware.'</p>\n<p>(8)  <em>console</em> (a) CON-sole 'cabinet'; (b) con-SOLE 'offer\nsympathy.'</p>\n<p>(9)  <em>desert</em> (a) DEZ-ert 'barren place'; (b) duh-ZERT 'merited\nreward or punishment'—usually plural.

Quasi-heteronyms</em></p>\n<p>These are words of identical spelling and different pronunciation\nthat have very different meanings but ultimately share\nthe same derivation.  Some surprising examples follow.  (Question:\nWhich pair in Part I really belongs here among the\n“quasis”?)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1)  <em>curate</em> (a) KEW-rit 'assistant of a rector or vicar,\nclergyman'; (b) kew-RATE 'act as curator of a museum\nor special collection.'  (Both words derive from Latin\n<em>cura</em> 'care.'</p>\n<p>(2)  <em>desert</em> (a) DEZ-ert 'barren place'; (b) duh-ZERT\n'abandon, etc.'  Also see under <em>Pure Heteronyms</em>.</p>\n<p>(3)  <em>lineage</em> (a) LIN-ee-idge 'descent, ancestry'; (b) LINEidge\n'the number of lines of type.'</p>\n<p>(4)  <em>multiply</em> (a) MUL-ti-ply; 'to perform multiplication\non' or 'increase'; (b) MUL-ti-plee; 'repeatedly' or 'several\ntimes.'</p>\n<p>(5)  <em>peaked</em> (a) 'having a peak, coming to a peak';\nrhymes with <em>beaked</em>; (b) PEEK-ed 'thin, emaciated.'</p>\n<p>(6)  <em>primer</em> (a) PRIM-mer 'beginning reader and speller';\n(b) PRY-mer 'base coat of paint.'  (Both are related to\nLatin <em>primus</em> 'first.')</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Much more obvious as “impure” heteronyms are noun-verb\npairs from the same root, though with different sounds,\nstresses, or both, such as CONduct and conDUCT, CONtract and\nconTRACT, RECord and reCORD, REFuse and reFUSE.  Noun-adjective\npairs include CONtent and conTENT, PATent and the\nadjective rhyming with <em>latent</em>.  There must be many other\nexamples in these two categories.</p>\n<p>Finally, we might note a sub-category of “semi-demiheteronyms”—words\nand phrases of identical spelling whose\ndifference in sound depends on hyphenation.  Examples: <em>reside</em>\n'dwell' and <em>re-side</em> 'put new siding on,' <em>preposition</em> and <em>preposition,\nrecreation</em> and <em>re-creation, light-housekeeping</em> and\n<em>lighthouse-keeping.</em></p>\n<p>The author welcomes additions to any of these lists from\nother VERBATIM readers (address: 4436 E. 5th St., Long Beach,\nCA 90814).</p>\n<h1></h1>",
