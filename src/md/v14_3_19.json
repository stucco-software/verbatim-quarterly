The\nChins and the Hans who followed them subdued the\nunorganized tribes and brought the area into the empire.\nChina called the newly conquered area <em>Vietnam;\nViet</em> 'extreme' + <em>nam</em> 'south': the southernmost reach\nof the Chinese empire.</p>\n<p>Vietnam remained Chinese until 907 A.D., when\nthe Chinese began fighting amongst themselves.  Five\nChinese clans seated thirteen emperors in forty-four\nyears.  The tribes of Vietnam took the challenge and\ndeclared themselves independent.  In Vietnam's stead\ncame Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin.</p>\n<p>France, on a colonial bent in 1867, took Cochin,\nTonkin, Laos, and Annam and renamed the acquisition\n<em>French Indochina</em>.  After WWII, France announced\nplans for federation of Indochina into the\nFrench Union.  Vietnamese nationalists under Ho Chi\nMinh—with communist China's support—fought the\nFrench for complete independence of Cochin, Annam,\nand Tonkin.  The later North-South confrontation notwithstanding,\nthe name, <em>Vietnam</em>, tattled a common\nalliance with China.  To call it <em>'Nam</em> ignores thousands\nof years of history and millions of hardships, ours included.\n<em>Vietnam</em> tells a story.  <em>'Nam</em> merely points\nsouth.</p>\n<p>American sailors, merchant marine and U.S.\nNavy, who used the ports of Hong Kong and Korea's\nInchon before WWII, heard the natives shout “Mee\nGook, Mee Gook” upon their arrival.  George W.\nWoods, ship's surgeon of the <em>USS Juniata</em>, in 1884,\nmentions <em>gook</em> in his log of travels in Korea.  He mentions\nanother new word, <em>chow</em>, in reference to shipboard\nmeals.  In this one instance, the listener didn't\nerr.  <em>Chow</em> is a Chinese word meaning 'to chew, to\nbite, to masticae.'  Still novel to officer Woods in 1884,\nit became part of our language circa 1877.</p>\n<p>Origins of slang are hard to pinpoint, but it seems\nprobable that sailors thought the Asians were saying,\n“Me Gook” to identify themselves.  <em>Mee</em>, by whatever\nChinese phonetic spelling, means 'beautiful.'  <em>Gook</em>\nmeans 'country or nation.'  America, the beautiful\ncountry.  Americans were then and are now, <em>Mee\nGook</em>, not the other way around.  We are the <em>gooks</em>, not\nthe Asians.</p>\n<p>American troops serving in China in WWII heard\ntheir Asian allies calling <em>Gung-ho</em> when charging the\nenemy, heaving a heavy load, or towing enormous\nweights: <em>Gung-ho</em> 'all together; a joint effort for the\ncommon good.'  How misleading to refer to a standout,\na go-getter as being <em>gung-ho</em>.  At work, some people\ncall the boss “a real gung-ho type.”  I certainly hope so.\nLet him lend a hand and help us get the job done—in\ntrue <em>Mee Gook</em> style.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
