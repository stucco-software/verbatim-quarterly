The differences in the Aboriginal and\nEuropean conceptual worlds are sometimes just as great.</p>\n<p>It is accepted that no language can be meaningfully\ndescribed as “primitive.”  Some communities are more technologically\ndeveloped than others, and their vocabulary will\nreflect that difference.  The native Australians, who had not yet\nmastered the art of boiling water (having no pottery), seemed\nbackward to a conquering age of steam.  They had no word for\n<em>locomotive</em>, but then their conquerors had no simple word for\n'hit by throwing a boomerang,' or 'the hole left by a goanna\nwhen it has broken the surface after hibernation,' or 'a hole in\na spear where the hook of a woomera [i.e., a throwing stick for\nlaunching a spear] is inserted,' concepts as important to\nAboriginal life as <em>centrifugal force</em> or <em>gunpowder</em> to their new\nneighbors.</p>\n<p>An age that valued arithmetic was impressed by the\nabsence of numerals higher than four in Aboriginal languages,\neasily concluding that the lack reflected mental inferiority.  In\nfact, Aboriginals quickly adopt European counting if employed\nas stockmen, just as European medical researchers can cope\nwith the intricacies of Aboriginal kinship terms if it is useful\nfor tracing the history of hereditary conditions.</p>\n<p>Most Australians know little about Aboriginal languages.\nTheir ideas about them are often naive, that they are “simple,”\n“have no grammar,” or are “primitive.”  Even the better\ninformed might have little idea how many Aboriginal languages\nthere are or what their relationship is.  We now have an\ninformed discussion of such questions.  For the reader interested\nin exotic languages or wanting to acquire a brief but\nreliable outline of the languages of Australia and their (rather\nsmall) contribution to English, Barry Blake's book will be an\nenjoyable discovery; for the scholar wanting to go more deeply\ninto the details of Australian Aboriginal linguistics, Dixon's\nbook will be a standard work.</p>\n<p><em>[G.W.
