A specialist in Celtic languages,\nJohn Hughes led an academic life that will prove to be of\nlasting influence on those whom he taught so well.\nFor those who may doubt that their work on words ending\nin <em>-oon</em> may occupy them for many m-oons to come,\nhere is a partial list of those they might like to examine:\n(alphabetized from the right): <em>baboon, racoon, cocoon,\ntycoon, rigadoon, buffoon, lagoon, dragoon, typhoon,\npantaloon, simoon, lampoon, harpoon, macaroon, picaroon,\nvinegaroon, maroon, gadroon, quadroon, octoroon,\npatroon, poltroon, platoon, cartoon, festoon.</em>  And let the\nfolk etymologist beware!</p>\n<h1></h1>",
