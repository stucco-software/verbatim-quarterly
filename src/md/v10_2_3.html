<p>Without punctuation words run together and writing is
difficult to read it should surprise no one therefore that
the system of stops pauses expressions of uncertainty interrogation
and emphasis and the marking of direct speech which
helps the reader understand writing is integral to almost every
language indeed punctuation is so much a part of written
communication that it is largely taken for granted at one time
though punctuation did not exist</p>
<p>Pinpointing the origins of punctuation is difficult, and
much work remains to be done on the subject.  Part of the
problem is defining what is meant by the term <em>punctuation</em>.  In
Hebrew texts of the fifth and sixth centuries and perhaps as
early as the first century B.C., single, double, or triple points
were placed above consonants to indicate preceding or following
vowels.  Hebrew as a spoken language was dying out at this
time, and scholars were worried that correct pronunciation of
the sacred texts would be gradually lost.  To preserve the
traditions of pronunciation and intonation for literary and
religious purposes, the system of points was instituted to
denote vowel sounds, since the Hebrew alphabet was composed
of consonants only.  This system was widely used; but
should it be considered punctuation?  Its function was unrelated
to the present function of punctuation, which is to clarify the
meaning of writing.</p>
<p>Greek inscriptions written before the fourth century B.C.
were continuous; that is, words and sentences were not
separated.  It was Aristotle who first noted the division of topics
into paragraphs, although scholars of today disagree whether
paragraphs were initially marked by dividing strokes between
them or by horizontal lines (called <em>paragraphos</em>) under the
beginning of a line in which the topic was concluded.  Fragments
of Plato's <em>Phaedo</em>, found at Gurob, have evidence of
paragraphs ending with a double point (:) as well as short
dashes separating different speeches.  Before Plato, Euripides
used a wedge, or sideways “V,” to mark changes of speakers in
his play <em>Antiope</em>.  Again the question arises, however: do
paragraphs and speaker markings constitute punctuation as we
now define the term?  Moreover, far from indicating general
practice, the above were isolated instances and might only
show that ancient Greeks knew such marks had value.  Since
the marks were not commonly or systematically employed, it is
possible to conclude that they were generally thought to be
insignificant.</p>
<p>Most etymologists attribute the invention of punctuation
to Aristophanes of Byzantium, who was the librarian of the
museum at Alexandria in 200 B.C.  Aristophanes devised a
system of points corresponding to our comma, semicolon, and
period to mark short, medium, and long sections of writing (the
sections were divided according to rhetorical theory).  The
points followed the last letter in each section and were placed
at the bottom, middle, or top of the letter, depending on the
length of the section.  (In short sections the point was at the
bottom, in long sections at the top.)  Since all writing at that
time was done only in majuscules, or capital letters, it was easy
to distinguish the three positions.</p>
<p>In addition to points, Aristophanes is generally credited
with creating the virgule, hyphen, apostrophe, and quotation
marks.  The virgule, which sometimes appeared as a slash and
other times as a long comma, was inserted between words
where the meaning might seem ambiguous.  The hyphen served
to denote compound words and was drawn as a curve or line
under the adjacent letters.  The apostrophe varied from a curve
or straight accent to a mere point; besides marking elision it
was placed after foreign names to note their origin and was
used to distinguish two consecutive vowels and double consonants.
Quotation marks in the form of crosses, horizontal
strokes, waved strokes, or wedges (perhaps evolved from
Euripides) were placed in the margin to draw attention to a
quotation.</p>
<p>Aristophanes' system was intended for the textual work of
scholars and was little used by scribes.  It was not until the
Renaissance that modern Greek punctuation became established
and Latin punctuation, which had borrowed from the
Greek system of points but used the points irregularly, without
adhering to their meaning, was incorporated.  Between Aristophanes'
day and the Renaissance, there were two important
developments in the history of punctuation.</p>
<p>First, during the seventh and eighth centuries, handwriting
changed from majuscule to minuscule letters.  This led to
capitalization, or a way of noting which words have more
value.  It also produced ascenders and descenders, which made
writing more difficult to read without punctuation marks.</p>
<p>Second, Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Holy
Roman Emperor from 768 to 814, and Alcuin, director of the
palace school, spirited an educational revival that resulted in
improved spelling and punctuation in biblical and liturgical
texts.  Until the eighth century only a degraded form of
Aristophanes' system was in use, consisting of two marks, the
point and the colon, with the colon's purpose simply to indicate
an intermediate stop.  (Frequently the colon was replaced by an
inverted semicolon or what is now the exclamation point.  This
symbol was not used for true exclamation, however.  It is
widely believed that today's exclamation point comes from the
Latin word <em>io</em> 'joy', with the one letter placed above the other.)
By the eleventh century, Aristophanes' system was restored;
moreover, two new punctuation marks including one called
<em>punctus interrogativus</em>, which strongly resembles the question
mark of today had been added to indicate both a syntactical
break and a change in inflection.  These marks derived from the
musical notation used in Gregorian chants.</p>
<p>In 1453, Constantinople, the centre of Greek culture, was
attacked and conquered by Ottoman Turks.  Many Greek
scholars migrated to Western Europe and there sparked intense
interest in Greek literature and writing.  When Italian printer
and editor Aldus Manutius set up a printing press in Venice in
1490, many of the books that came from the press were
popular editions of Aristotle, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Sophocles,
Herodotus, Demosthenes, and Plutarch, all printed in
Greek.  Greek punctuation was used so that the modern
comma, colon, and period as well as the apostrophe to
indicate an omitted letter became, by the time of Aldus's
grandson (also named Aldus), standard for writers and printers.
The Latin question mark of a comma over a point was
maintained but the comma was enlarged to look like the upper
part of our present question mark; the Greek question mark, a
point above a comma, became the semicolon.</p>
<p>Aldus Manutius the younger explained the markings in a
book called <em>Orthographie ratio</em> (“System of Orthography”).
Even more important than the exposition is the fact that in this
work Aldus became the first to state that the purpose of
punctuation was to clarify syntax; therefore punctuation should
make for an orderly and systematic arrangement of phrases,
clauses, and sentences.  Earlier printers, like Gutenberg, Fust,
and Schoeffer in Germany (who used only the point and colon)
and Sweynheym and Pannartz in Italy (who used the point and
colon and added the semicolon for abbreviation), had no clear
conception of the purpose of stops.  As a result, early printers,
like early writers, employed few marks.</p>
<p>By the end of the sixteenth century, the system of
punctuation as described by the younger Aldus was widely
used, albeit inconsistently.  Usage was predominantly based on
elocution; punctuation marks came to identify pauses of one
(comma), two (semicolon), and three (colon) units, which might
be observed by a reader, especially if he was reading aloud to
an audience.  It was an age of drama, poetry, oratory, and song,
and great attention was given to spoken language.  However,
there was a second school of thought at the time that believed
pauses of varying lengths to be arbitrary and saw punctuation
as a means of clarifying the grammar of a text.  As pauses in
speech and breaks in syntax do not always coincide (speech
being more flexible than syntax), the two schools were in
conflict.  By the end of the seventeenth century the second
school had prevailed.</p>
<p>The evolution of modern punctuation in English is related
to the rise of writers like Jonson, Hobbes, Dryden, Defoe, and
Swift, who favored a shorter and less complex sentence
structure than Donne, Hooker, and other writers of “earsplitting
eloquence” whose work was modeled on Cicero's.
Shorter and simpler sentences meant less punctuation was
necessary.  Less elaborate prose also led to further standardization
of the punctuation system and produced a better understanding
of what punctuation can do and need not do.</p>
<p>Today, the drive toward fewer punctuation marks continues “to
the point of insufficiency” according to noted linguist
Jacques Barzun.  Modern readers tend to be distracted by the
heavy punctuation in the prose of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.  Today, even if the writing were as ponderous
and involved as, say, Sterne's, many of his compounded
punctuation marks would be omitted.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that the move to lighter punctuation will be
reversed, at least in this century.  Newspapers and magazines,
which often seem overly preoccupied with brevity, continue to
proliferate, setting the tone for present writers.  Narrower
columns and smaller type also play a part because they make
punctuation more noticeable.  Numerous commas and semicolons
in a newspaper sentence, for instance, would be more
hindering than helpful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, punctuation probably won't die out as
it did following Aristophanes, even though present writers who
have difficulty mastering punctuation might sometimes prefer
that it did.  The system of pointing (“punctuation” derives from
the Latin word <em>punctus</em> 'point') is too valuable.  It provides
humor when it is used incorrectly, as Shakespeare does deliberately
in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, but, more important, it
helps writing become more understandable.  Proper punctuation
even makes it possible to make sense of a sentence that
has the word <em>had</em> eleven consecutive times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jim, where Bill had had “had had,” had had
“had”; “had had” had had the teacher's approval.</p>
<p>No system that can do that will ever be lost entirely.</p>
