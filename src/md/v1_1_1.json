Of the\ntotal English word stock of some million words, the\nmodern American “desk” or “college” dictionary includes\napproximately 100,000 to 150,000. Although\nmany rare, obsolete, and archaic words are cited, the\nselection of entries begins with the commonest words\nof the language. In contrast, it is of interest to note\nthat the earliest British dictionaries, published in the\n17th and early 18th centuries, were primarily glossaries\nof hard words. How did this change in policy come\nabout?</p>\n<p>Robert Cawdrey's <em>Table Alphabeticall</em> (1604),\ngenerally considered to have been the first English\ndictionary, claimed to teach “the true writing, and\nunderstanding of hard usuall English words, borrowed\nfrom the Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, or French, etc...\nwith the interpretation thereof by plain English\nwords.” This unassuming little book, containing\nscarcely 3000 entries, was patterned on the bilingual\nand multilingual dictionaries that had been appearing\nin Europe for more than a hundred years before\nCawdrey's time. What distinguished the <em>Table Alphabeticall</em>\nfrom its interlingual predecessors was that it\n“translated” from English to English--that is, from\nhard English to plain English. Nineteen years after the\npublication of Cawdrey's book, an enterprising fellow\nnamed Henry Cockeram published his <em>English Dictionarie,</em>\na three-volume work of which the second\nvolume converted “vulgar words” into “more refined\nand elegant speech,” thereby completing the pattern\nset by the earlier dictionaries that had translated from\nLatin to English and from English to Latin.</p>\n<p>Other prominent dictionaries of this period that\nfollowed the tradition of defining only the hard words\nwere John Bullokar's <em>English Expositor</em> (1616),\nThomas Blount's <em>Glossographia</em> (1656), Edward\nPhillips' <em>New World of English Words</em> (1658), and\nJohn Kersey's <em>New World of Words</em> (1706), a revision\nof Phillips, later abridged by Kersey and republished\nas the <em>Dictionarium Anglo-Brittanicum</em> (1708). Each\nof these books enlarged the scope of the English dictionary.\nBullokar, with his inclusion of “olde words\nnow growne out of use, and divers termes of art,\nproper to the learned in Logicke, Philosophy, Law,\nPhysicke, Astronomie, etc.,” was the first to list obsolete\nwords and to indicate the field in which a technical\nterm had application. Phillips expanded the treatment\nof technical terms by availing himself of the services\nof a large number of specialists (“Antiquities, Elias\nAshmole, Esq.; Law Terms, Mr. Hern; Magick, Mr.\nTurner; Physick, Dr. Sparks...). Kersey revised\nPhillips, enlarged the vocabulary by 20,000 additional\nentries, and added “a whole new scientific and technical\nvocabulary.”</p>\n<p>In 1721 there appeared the first dictionary that\nattempted to treat the entire range of English vocabulary--the\ncommon as well as the difficult words. This\nwas Nathan Bailey's <em>Universal Etymological Dictionary,</em>\nwhose stated purpose was to give “the Derivations\nof the Generality of Words in the English Tongue,”\nin addition to “a brief and clear explication of all\ndifficult Words.” As Bailey's interest in etymology\napplied to simple as well as learned words, he became\nthe first English lexicographer to enter and define the\ncommon words of the language. The policy set by him\nin this matter is followed in most modern dictionaries,\nand the “dictionary of hard words” is no longer the\nusual kind.</p>\n<p>The impossible inkhorn terms of Anglicized Latin\n(<em>e.g., adolescenturate</em> to play the fool; <em>basiate</em> to kiss;\n<em>obequitate</em> to ride about) continued to clutter English\ndictionaries until Samuel Johnson, declaring that these\nhad not “been seen in any book but the works of lexicographers,”\nwisely chose to eliminate most of them\nfrom his masterwork, <em>A Dictionary of the English\nLanguage</em> (London, 1755). Building on the work of\nBailey as Bailey had built on that of Phillips, Dr.\nJohnson brought to lexicography a more realistic approach\nto English vocabulary, and a new thoroughness\nand precision of definition. “The rigour of interpretative\nlexicography requires,” he states in his preface,\n“that the explanation and the word explained, should\nbe always reciprocal.” In this, and in all major respects,\nlexicography truly came of age with Samuel Johnson.\nOn his early work was built the <em>Oxford English Dictionary,</em>\nand through his influence on Noah Webster\nin this country he set the pattern for the modern\nAmerican dictionary.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
