Bernstein, rev. David Grambs, (2nd ed., Times Books, 1988), 278 pp.</p>\n<p>As a practicing lexicographer (I have complied\ntwo Arabic bilingual dictionaries with illustrative\nsentences), but more important, as one who continually\nhas trouble retrieving certain English words\nfrom my mental lexicon, I consider this book a real\ngold mine.  The blurb on the back of has it\nabsolutely right: “A new and expanded edition of\nthe popular 'reinvention' of the standard dictionary\nfirst created by legendary <em>New York Times</em> language\nexpert Theodore Bernstein.”  Although I seldom\nwork crossword puzzles, this is a must book for the\ncrossword-puzzle addict or even the occasional\nplayer.</p>\n<p>I like this dictionary because, like most people,\nI often find myself groping for words that are right\n“on the tip of my tongue.”  How many of you, like\nme, cannot always remember that a <em>rhinologist</em> is the\nmedical specialist dealing with nasal problems?\n(Why not a <em>nasologist</em>?) Even after memorizing <em>osteologist</em>\n(skeleton), <em>heterologist</em> (tissue), or <em>helcologist</em>\n(ulcers), I have difficulty in remembering these particular\nwords.  I have occasionally confused a <em>hematologist</em>\n(blood) with a <em>hepatologist</em> (liver).  And many\nof my students in introductory linguistics courses\nconfuse <em>etymology</em> (word origins) with <em>entomology</em>\n(the study of insects).  Now that I have succeeded in\ngetting you to see that a reserve dictionary is much\nmore than a thesaurus with which, of course, it\nshares some similarities, its purpose is really to list\ndefinations in alphabetical order which, in turn, will\ngive you the word that you have forgotten, confused,\nor just plain do not know or cannot recall.</p>\n<p>One can quibble, as always, with some of the\ndefinitions presented in any dictionary, so this work\nis not different from many others in this respect.  For\ninstance, a 'wrestler or boxer over 175 pounds' is\ncalled a <em>heavyweight</em> (p.274). I do not think I have\never seen (on TV's professional wrestling) a heavyweight\nwrester who weighted 175; most of them\nweight over 200.  Although this is a picayunish point,\nconsider that wrestlers are also divided up, according\nto the author, into <em>lightweight, featherweight,\nwelterweight, middleweight</em>, and <em>heavyweight</em>, as are\nboxers.  To my knowledge, these terms are not <em>normally</em>\nused in professional (dare we call it “entertainment”)\nwrestling as they are in professional and\namateur boxing.</p>\n<p>Under <em>language expert</em> (p. 133 and p. 271), one\nfinds <em>logogogue</em> whereas I would have thought the\nproper choice to be <em>linguist</em> or perhaps even the\nawkward <em>linguistician</em> (a term to be avoided).  Also,\nI fail to see how <em>polyglot</em> (p.133) can be defined as\n'language mixture' since it merely refers to a multilingual\nperson.  'Language mixture' may refer to\nwhat linguists call <em>pidginization</em> and <em>creolization</em> of\nlanguages, a process of language simplification (although\neven this is misleading and not the entire\nstory).</p>\n<p>To illustrate how useful the volume can be, let\nus assume that you have heard the two common Yiddish\nloanwords used in English, <em>schlimazel</em> and <em>schlemiel</em>.\nHow do you find them in a reserve dictionary?\nYou have to remember that both refer to a <em>bungler</em>\nor <em>bungling</em> person, and that is indeed what you have\nto look under to find them.</p>\n<p>Bernstein explains in the introduction (p. vii)\nhow he got the idea for the book in the first place.\nHe was chatting with a friend about Chinese food,\nand in the course of the conversation he remarked\nthat the words <em>won ton</em> (a Chinese dumpling used as\nan ingredient in a soup of the same name) “made\nperhaps even more sense if they were read backward.”\nHis friend immediately replied “— just\nlike in <em>Madam</em>, <em>I'm Adam</em>.”  And neither one could\nretrieve the word for something which read the\nsame forwards or backwards.  (<em>Palindrome,</em> of\ncourse!)  If you are still <em>addeled, addle-brained</em>, or <em>addlepated</em>\n(p. 49), do not be: look up 'confused' in this\ndictionary!  If you like words (and are looking for a\ngreat game to play at your next coctail party), this\nbook is definitely for you.  About the nicest compliment\nI could give Bernstein (and Grambs) for producing\nthis excellent work is to remark, why did I\nnot think of doing it first?</p>\n<p><em>[Alan S.
