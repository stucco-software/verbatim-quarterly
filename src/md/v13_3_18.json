The first thought that came\nto my mind reading the review was—you're definitely\nnot into Yiddish.</p>\n<p>For starters, <em>enjoy</em> is definitely not Yiddish.\nMaybe a Jewish college student waiting tables in a\nCalifornia Health Food Bistro might say “Hi, my\nname is Bruce; I'll be your waiter for the evening.\nEnjoy.”  But even <em>that</em> scenario is unlikely if the kid is\nreally Jewish and not <em>formisched</em> (i.e., 'mixed up').</p>\n<p>As to your statement that Yiddish owes its dissemination\nto New York publishing houses and other New\nYork training grounds for Hollywood types.  Well,\nmaybe.  Still, Yiddish outside Jewish circles is a relatively\nnew phenomenon, not more than 25 years old.\nBefore that it was rather uncool to be Jewish, especially\nif one wanted a job, or a house in certain neighborhoods,\nor membership in clubs.</p>\n<p>I think the main dissemination was accomplished\nby the <em>schmatte schleppers</em> (manufacturers' representatives\nin the ready-to-wear industry) about the same\ntime an anti-discrimination movement in the U.S. was\ntaking place.  Many of the salesmen who spread\nthroughout the U.S. promoting their wares originated\nfrom New York.  They used Yiddish words such as\n<em>tineff</em> for 'shoddy goods,' <em>goniff</em> for 'thief,' <em>mumser</em> for\nan 'unpleasant person' (usually the head merchandise\nbuyer), <em>zu viel gelt</em> for 'too much money,' <em>schlock</em> for\n'junk,' and so on.  The words caught on with the store\npersonnel and owners, even in the department\nstores—and even with the <em>goyishe</em>—i.e., the 'gentiles.'</p>\n<p>At trade exhibits and other gatherings of the\n<em>schmatte</em> industry, Yiddish words became part of the\nunwritten trade lexicon.  I think being Jewish became\nsomewhat in vogue (people I had never suspected—\nand had known for many years—admitted to being\nJewish) and Yiddish found its way into conversational\nEnglish, especially among the intelligentsia.</p>\n<p>Yet, hearing Yiddish from the mouths of gentiles\ndoesn't always sit well with many Jews, because the\ngentile simply does not understand the delicate meanings\nof some of those words—words created in the\nghettos of European communities to describe situations,\nthings, and people unfamiliar to American culture.\nAs a collector of Jewish humor, I cannot resist\ntelling good Jewish jokes to my gentile friends—only\nto regret it moments later.  They simply do not “get\nit,” although those of Italian heritage often surprise\nme with their insight into such humor.</p>\n<p>There are many dialects of Yiddish.  For example,\nJews who lived in the German sector of Czechoslovakia\n(Sudetenland) all spoke German, most also Yiddish\nand Czech.  Their Yiddish was a localized version; but\nthey also spoke “proper” Yiddish.  They spoke German\nin dialect, but they all could also speak “hoch\nDeutsch.”  And the same with Czech—the dialect of\nthe region as well as the Prague (classic) Czech.  Surely\na nightmare for a linguist, no?  The moment he opened\nhis mouth, a stranger could be instantly classified as to\nhis station in life, his politics, religion, and the reason\nfor his presence.</p>\n<p>So, Mr. Urdang, enjoy... and <em>Bleib gesund</em>\n('Stay healthy!')</p>\n<p><em>[John F.
