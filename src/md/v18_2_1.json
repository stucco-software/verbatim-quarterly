Not only was the\nmentioning of a man's (or woman's) leg taboo, but\nthe garment covering it was also forbidden to be\nspoken of in polite conversation.  In modern dialogue,\nwhich in no sense approaches the gentility of\nthe perfumed puritanicals, the denotation of <em>unmentionables</em>\nhas broadened to include body organs,\ncurses, and biological functions.  How clever it is,\nthough, that metaphor, the great facilitating factor in\nthe changing of word meanings, has carefully camouflaged\nthe unmentionables of the current day.</p>\n<p>Consider the following vignette, apparently\nvoid of any hint of an unmentionable:</p>\n<p>Mrs. Eleanor Sutherland, the vivacious wife of\nthe petroleum magnate, H. R. Sutherland, is hosting\na midsummer patio brunch with her friend of many a\nsocial season, Grace Walthum, wife of Sam Walthum,\nconsidered by many to be the richest man in the\nstate, in honor of Sandra Chapman, the young Illinois\ndebutante and intended wife of Tom Weed, Republican\ncandidate for governor.</p>\n<p>“Girls, the treat for this morning is avocado finger\nsandwiches.  Fanny made them for the first time\nlast week, and H. R. thought they were simply\nsumptuous.  Only today, she made them with German\npumpernickel.  I do hope you like them.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Eleanor, you must pencil this off for me on\none of your personalized recipe cards.  These are\npurely delicious.  Don't you agree, Sandra?”</p>\n<p>“Indeed, I do.  I might serve them as hors\nd'oeuvres for Tom's political science seminar at the\nuniversity next week.”</p>\n<p>“You two are testimony enough for Fanny's culinary\npowers, although I do detest her slicing the\nbread so thick.  After finishing off the sandwiches,\nwe'll savor some vanilla mousse.”</p>\n<p>“That's a lovely centerpiece of bachelor's buttons\nand cowslips, Eleanor.  Wherever did you find\nsuch exquisite flowers?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and the cubicle you have them arranged\nin is just gorgeous.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Frank, the gardener, grew them on the\nfront lawn.  He's hoping to have mistletoe by Christmas,\nand if the spring orchids don't fizzle, Sandra\ncan use them in her nuptial ceremony.  By the way,\nSandra, where will you and Tom honeymoon?”</p>\n<p>“We're going to spend two weeks in the Grand\nTetons.  Then we're off to the ocean where Tom says\nhe's going to swim stark nude.  Would you believe\nit?”</p>\n<p>At this moment, there is a disturbing noise\nnearby.</p>\n<p>“Jeepers creepers, Eleanor, what is that whirring\ncommotion?”</p>\n<p>“Why, Grace, look across the lawn to the orchard.\nIt's a feisty covey of flatulent partridges taking\nflight.  Aren't they beautiful, girls?”</p>\n<p>“Tom's greyhound would certainly think they\nwere a beautiful sight.”</p>\n<p>“My, how the time has slipped away.  We must\nbe going, Sandra.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we must, and Mrs. Sutherland, I\nhave so enjoyed being a part of such a stimulating\nconversation.”</p>\n<p>“Girls, it was my deepest pleasure.  Please do\ncome again.”</p>\n<p>Actually, in the preceding dialogue, three ladies\nfrom the highest level of society can be cited for\ninnocently mentioning the unmentionables in no less\nthan twenty-plus instances, to wit:</p>\n<p><em>Avocado</em> was borrowed from Spanish and was\noriginally spelled <em>aguacate</em>.  The word's origin is Nahuatl\n<em>ahuacatl</em>, a word meaning 'testicle,' because of\nthe similarity of the shape of the fruit.</p>\n<p><em>Pumpernickel</em> was borrowed directly from German,\na compound of <em>pumpern</em> 'to fart' and <em>Nickel</em> the\n'devil.'  The allusion could be to a hand slapping the\nloaf, thereby producing a deep, hollow, fartlike\nsound.  On the other hand (pun intended), the root\nsense might be implying the bread is so hard to digest\nit would make the devil fart.</p>\n<p><em>Pencil</em> (as well as <em>penicillin</em>) was borrowed from\nLatin <em>pēnicillus</em> 'paintbrush,' a diminutive of <em>peniculus</em>\n'brush,' which is also a diminutive of <em>penis</em>, which\nin Latin (also) meant 'tail.'  Figuratively, a brush is a\npenis is a tail.</p>\n<p><em>Seminar</em> came through German from Latin\n<em>sēminārium</em> 'plant nursery.'  The word's ultimate origin\nis Latin <em>semen</em> 'seed.'  Since the testicles are producers\nof semen, they are often referred to in slang\nas <em>seed</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Testimony</em> and <em>detest</em> are both based on Latin\n<em>testis</em> 'witness, testicle.'  In the final analysis, a man\ncan only witness to his virility by his testicles.  The\nroot sense of <em>testimony</em>, then, is 'a laying of the testes\non the evidence table' and of <em>detest</em> is to 'hate to the\nextent of losing one's testicles.'</p>\n<p><em>Vanilla</em>, extracted from the seedpods of a tropical\nplant, was borrowed from Spanish <em>vainilla</em>, which\ndenoted the flower, the pod, or the flavoring.  Spanish\nhad formed <em>vainilla</em> from <em>vaina</em> 'sheath,' a word it\nhad borrowed from Latin <em>vāgina</em> 'sheath for a\nsword.' Later, vagina was borrowed into English\nand assigned its present meaning from the similarity\nof the functions.</p>\n<p>Bachelor's buttons, a term that denotes a plant\nwith spherical-shaped flowers, was created as a metaphor\nof the male testes.</p>\n<p>Cowslip is not “cow's lip.”  It is from Old English\ncūslyppe 'cow manure,' literally, 'cow slip.'  The\nflower is aptly named, since it grows well in profusely\nmanured pastures.</p>\n<p>Cubicle is from Latin cubāre 'to bend over in\npreparation for sexual activity.'  The word now\ndesignates a space so small a person might be required\nto bend over to enter it.</p>\n<p>In its root sense, mistletoe is the 'bird-shit\nplant.'  The word is cognate with Old High German\nmist 'manure, shit, dung.'  The seed of the plant was\ndispensed in the dung of birds.</p>\n<p>Orchid is from the Greek orchis 'testicle.'  The\nflower was so called by Pliny the Elder because the\ndouble root resembled two hairy testicles.</p>\n<p>Fizzle is probably from Middle English fisten 'to\nfart.'  In 1532 the word is recorded with the meaning\nto 'fart noiselessly.'</p>\n<p>The Grand Tetons is a mountain range in Wyoming.\nThey were coarsely named from their root\nsense, 'big tits,' from French teton 'tit,' because of\ntheir shape.</p>\n<p>Stark nude is euphemistic for stark naked.  The\nterm was originally start naked (Middle English stert,\nfrom Old English steart 'tail, ass') and is preserved in\nredstart 'bird with red tail feathers.'</p>\n<p>Jeepers creepers is nothing other than a euphemistic\ncover-up for the curse Jesus Christ.  The term\nwas actually used as early as 1937.</p>\n<p>Feisty, like fizzle, began as Middle English fysten,\nfisten 'to fart.' At one time, fysting curre referred\nto a stinking dog, and feist named a small dog\nof mixed breed.</p>\n<p>Covey, like cubicle, is from Latin cubāre 'to bend\nover for sexual purposes.' The word came through\nMiddle French cover 'to incubate.'</p>\n<p>Flatulent “having stomach gas” came through\nFrench from Latin flatus 'a farting.'</p>\n<p>Partridge came through Old French and Latin\nperdīcem, from Greek pérdīx 'partridge,' which is\nrelated to pérdesthai 'to fart.'  The partridge is a\n“farting bird” because of the noise made by its being\nflushed.</p>\n<p>Finally, the first element of greyhound probably\nmeans 'bitch.'  Old Icelandic greyhundr is 'bitch\nhound.'</p>\n<p>Most will agree that euphemism is an acceptable\nmeans of avoiding the unmentionables, unutterables,\ninexplicables, ineffables, inexpressibles, and\nwhatever else they have been called.  While it is the\nfunction of metaphor to conceal the unmentionables,\nit is likewise the pleasurable business of etymology\nto expose them.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
