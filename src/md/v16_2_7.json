(I have ignored all notations\nof tone since they would not affect the analysis.\nThe Vietnamese example is from the word quoc-ngu\nwhich I understand to be the same as the Chinese\nKuoyu = 'National Language')</p>\n<p>It is at this point that another problem arises.\nNelson gives no entry for bi-koku 'beautiful country'\n('The United States of America').  In fact the Japanese\nfor 'The United States of America' is beikoku = 'rice-country.'\nThis brings Amerigo Vespucci into the\npicture.</p>\n<p>Consulting my Tz'u Hai (tz'u 'word or phrase' +\nhai 'sea' = “a sea of words/phrases”), I discover that\nthe Chinese meikuo is actually short for mei-li chienho-chung-kuo.\nThe mei from mei-li = 'American' and\nthe kuo from chien-ho-chung-kuo = 'firm(ly)-enclosing-all-nations'\n= 'United States.'  In Nelson, a few\nentries after beikoku, I read that Meriken means\n'American,' that the character for 'rice' in this case is\npronounced “Me” not “bei.”  Backtracking to the Chinese\ndictionary I find that mei-li comes from ya-mei-lichia.\nIn other words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amerigo (Italian) = Americus (Latin) thus to\nAmerica [the New World] = Ya-Mei-Li-Chia (Chinese)\n= “A-Me-Ri-Ka” (one possible Sino-Japanese\npronunciation) = “A-Bei-Ri-Ka” (Japanese).  The\nfirst, third and fourth characters are the same in\nboth Japanese and Chinese.  The second characters\ndiffer.  In Chinese it is the character for 'beautiful,'\nin Japanese for 'rice or grain.'  The phonetic nature\nof Chinese (and Sino-Japanese) is demonstrated\nagain!  [See my letter in XV,2.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on the above I believe that Mr. Henn is\nprobably correct in attributing Gook to an East Asian\nMee Gook, for all of the area by the time of the T'ang\nwas culturally if not politically under the sway of the\nCentral Kingdom (Chungkuo).</p>\n<p><em>[Charles G.
