The speaker\nprobably thinks “taking it for granite” is correct, justifying\nit as meaning “as solid and stable as a slab of\ngranite.”  Similar faulty justification could be made for\n“intensive purposes.”  In fact, such expressions may be\nperpetuated by others who hear the wrong version of\nthe cliché, take it for granite, and, for all intensive\npurposes, use it as the genuine expression.</p>\n<p><em>Mayan</em> (as in “What's yours is yours, and what's\nMayan is Mayan”) is another of Mr. Lederer's more\ndubious examples.  He maintains <em>Mayan</em> is a rare form\nof Slurvian created by adding an extra syllable.  I\nmaintain it is not Slurvian at all.  It is regional dialect.\nHow do we judge <em>all</em> as in “I need to get some all for\nmy car”?  <em>All</em> is Alabama dialect; is it also Slurvian?  I\nwould judge that it isn't, no more so than <em>Earl</em>, as in “I\nneed to get some Earl for my car,” as stated in the\nNinth Ward of New Orleans.  I have heard <em>milk</em> pronounced\n“meowk” by one of my Georgia relatives, but\nI would hesitate to label “meowk” as an example of\ndouble-syllable Slurvian.  That pronunciation can\nprobably be traced to familial/regional roots, not to\nlazy mouth disease.  In fact, I should doubt that a lazy\nmouth would bother to add an extra syllable.\nWouldn't the Slurvian tongue take the most slothful\nroute, avoiding waggle where waggle is avoidable?</p>\n<p>Before we Slurvophobian sleuths begin our hunt,\nsome rules of the game need to be defined.  I suggest\nthat each Slurvian term should have <em>one or more</em> of the\nfollowing characteristics to distinguish it from some\nother form of (mis) pronunciation:</p>\n<p>1.  Consonants and/or vowels are left out.  Examples\ntaken from Mr. Lederer's list are “lining” for <em>lightning</em>,\n“lays” for <em>ladies</em>, “forced” for <em>forest</em>, “please”\nfor <em>police</em>, and “torment” for <em>tournament</em>.</p>\n<p>2.  Vowels are squashed.  Whereas “Mayan” is dialect,\n“mahn,” bearing a squashed <em>i</em>, could certainly be\nconsidered an impure Slurvian form of the word.\n“Whir” is pure Slurvian for <em>where</em>.</p>\n<p>3.  Combinations of sounds that ordinarily require\nmovement from both lips and tongue are compromised\nso that all the work is done by only the lips or\nonly the tongue.  Consider the case of the three\nSams—Sam Witch, Sam Ridge, and Sam Itch.  Any\nway you slice it, the Earl of Sandwich was responsible,\nbut only two of the three examples fit the Slurvian\nrule of swallow and squash.  Sam Witch and\nSam Itch are pure Slurvian.  The lips took away the\nduty of the tongue by substituting an <em>m</em> for an <em>n</em>.\nBut what about Sam Ridge?  The tongue hoisted\nitself up and bothered to put in an unnecessary <em>r</em>.\nWouldn't Sam Ridge, then, be just plain mispronunciation?\nSand Ridge, on the other hand ...</p>\n<p>4.  Combinations of sounds requiring two or more consecutive\ntongue movements are distorted into one\ncompromised sound.  <em>What are you doing</em> becomes\n“Watch a dune.”  How much easier for the tongue to\nsplat itself against the palate and make a <em>ch</em> sound\nrather than make three more delicate maneuvers to\nform the sounds of a <em>t</em>, and an <em>r</em>, and a <em>y</em>.</p>\n<p>Removed from cliché, could there be pure Slurvian\nwords that have become exalted by repetition—perhaps\nan elevated Slurvian of the upper\nplane?  “Bob wire” (for <em>barbed wire</em>) may qualify as\nelevated Slurvian.  At first I was prepared to offer\n“sparrow grass” (for <em>asparagus</em>) as elevated Slurvian; I\nnow retract the offer.  Is it Slurvian or is it wondrous\nmispronunciation?  It doesn't fit the Slurvian, rule of\nconsonant deletion.  The tongue has added an <em>r</em> after\nthe <em>g</em>; would a lazy tongue go to that much trouble?\nLike “sparrow grass,” “calvary” for <em>cavalry</em>, one of Mr.\nLederer's questionable examples of Slurvian, falls midway\nbetween pure mispronunciation and misunderstood\nexpression, perpetuated by a massive misuse.  A\nSlurv who knew the difference would say “cavry.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps we Slurvophobes should be alert to three\ntypes of pure Slurvian; regular, elevated, and complete\nsentence.  I offer the following examples of completesentence\nSlurvian:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I moan ohm; I mow Nome: <em>I'm going home</em>.)</p>\n<p>Watch a dune: (<em>What are you doing?</em>)</p>\n<p>Watch a Seine: (<em>What are you saying?</em>)</p>\n<p>Whirred ego; Word ego: (<em>Where did he go</em>?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Below are more examples of regular pure Slurvian,\nto add to the collection:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A myrrh can</em> 'from the United States': “I can tell\nshe's A myrrh can ...”.</p>\n<p><em>ever</em> 'each': “Bless us, ever one.”</p>\n<p><em>fern</em> 'not A myrrh can': “I have some fern currency.”</p>\n<p><em>gum mint</em> 'ruling body': “That's against gum mint\npolicy.”</p>\n<p><em>pearl</em> 'more than one': “What's the pearl of hex?”\n(see VERBATIM XI, 3)</p>\n<p><em>sits in</em> 'inhabitant': “I'm an A myrrh can sits in, as\nopposed to a fern sits in.”</p>\n<p><em>to mar</em> 'the day after today': “I'll think about that\nto mar.”</p>\n<p><em>twin knee</em> 'one more than nineteen': “Less play\nTwin Knee Questions.”</p>\n<p><em>whir</em> 'in what place?': “Whir am I?”</p>\n<p><em>yes D</em> 'the day before today': “He's gone today, but\nhe was here yes D and will be back to mar.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>[Virginia Howard, Metairie, Louisiana]</em></p>\n<h2></h2>",
