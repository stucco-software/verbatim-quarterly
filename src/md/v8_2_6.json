Before one\nknows it, one's proud family name can be turned into an\nunfortunate adjective.  On first sight, proofreader's error\nmight seem to save this one, but a second look (and\nattempted utterance) reveals a five-syllable throat-stopper.</p>\n<p>Oh, we have become quite used to <em>Shakespearean</em>\nand <em>Freudian and Einsteinian,</em> and maybe “getting used\nto” is what it takes, because some “proper adjectives”\nthat have recently appeared in print or on the air are not\neasily assimilable, and not only for reasons of sheer\npronounceability.  I submit the following examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Saul Bellow and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\nhave been modified into the modifiers <em>Bellovian</em> and\n<em>Longfellovian.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Film directors have been said to work “in the\n<em>Mankiewiczian</em> style” or “the <em>Hitchcokian</em> tradition.”</p>\n<p>Composer Gustav Mahler transmutes to <em>Mahlerian,</em>\nand this sentence appears in a review: “Conductor\nGeorge Solti knows the secret of tightening the <em>Mahlerian</em>\nsprawl and tempering the <em>Mahlerian</em> bombast without\ndevaluing the <em>Mahlerian</em> spirit.”  After reading this,\none feels vaguely overcome by a tropical disease.</p>\n<p>Those who follow in the footsteps of or are likened\nto Swiss learning theorist Jean Piaget (pee-ah-ZHAY)\nhave been called in print <em>Piagetian</em>.  Now, is this to be\nsaid “pee-ah-ZHAY-shun” or “pee-ah-ZHAY-tee-uhn” or\nperhaps, to honor the original pronunciation of the\nname, “pee-ah-ZHAY-ee-uhn”?  This last repeats the case\nof <em>Fonsecaian</em>.  The mouth wants to say “fon-SECK-ee-uhn”\nand “pee-ah-ZHAY-uhn,” but the spelling won't let\nit.</p>\n<p>It is somehow demeaning to the reputation and\nmemory of one of the world's greatest conductors when\nhis style is referred to as <em>Toscaninian</em>.</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way <em>Aristotelian</em> stopped\nsounding peculiar, and perhaps the same happy fate\nawaits author Bernard Malamud.  Meanwhile,\n<em>Malamudian</em> doesn't quite make it.  Maybe a little inventiveness\nis in order for some of these newly famous\nnames.  In this instance, how about <em>Malamudic?</em>  That\nseems to me perfect, borrowed from the manner of\n<em>Platonic,</em> yet with <em>Talmudic</em> overtones.</p>\n<p>Now, I have seen <em>Frostean</em> for Robert Frost, which\ndoesn't ring quite right, at least yet.  So one tries out\n“Frostlike,” gets playful with “Frosted,” and hurtles\nahead to “Frozen.”</p>\n<p>And what about philosopher Martin Buber?  I have\nheard <em>Buberian</em> on the radio, which is pretty bad.\n“Buberic” would be no better.  “Bubonic?”  At this point,\nI rise to my <em>Salperean</em> heights (“Look, Ma, I'm\nfamous!”) ... and quit.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
