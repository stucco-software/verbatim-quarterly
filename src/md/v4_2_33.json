Said Deacon Stebbins,\n“Unabridged dictionaries are dangerous books.  In their\npages men's evilest thoughts find means of expression.\nTerms denoting all that is blasphemous, foul or obscene are\nprinted there for men, women, and children to read and\nponder.  Such books should have their covers padlocked and\nbe chained to reading desks, in the custody of responsible\nlibrarians, preferably church members in good standing.\nPermission to open such books should be granted only after\ncareful inquiry as to which word a reader plans to look up\nand how he plans to use it.”</p>\n<p>I derived my appreciation of the language very early\nfrom my father who was a merciless critic.  My mother was\na church organist, and the current minister telephoned our\nhome once and asked my father, “Is your wife convenient?”\nMy father replied, “A strange question, and for what\npurpose I cannot imagine, but yes, I believe I would say\nthat she is quite convenient,” and hung up.  My mother\ncried, the minister called again, and all turned out well\nafter my parents were finally speaking. [<em>Marianne B. Garland, Wellington, Kansas</em>].</p>\n<h2></h2>",
