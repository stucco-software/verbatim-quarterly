His articles, “On\nLanguage,” have appeared weekly (except when he\nwas taking a holiday) in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>\nsince 1979.  As American language buffs\nknow—even those who do not take <em>The New York\nTimes</em>—he is a fearless commentator on every aspect\nof English who has gathered behind him not\nonly an army of admires but a cadre of contributors,\ndubbed “the Lexicographic Irregulars,” who send\nhim citations, comments, and queries.  I call him\n“Bill” partly because most people do and partly because\nwe have known each other since about 1967\nwhen his <em>New Language of Politics</em> was edited under\nmy direction at Random House.  Although he is not a\nprofessional linguist, Bill knows a great deal about\nlanguage and, notwithstanding some of the comments\nhe makes in his column, is very sensitive to it.\nHe is a very good writer, too, though I sometimes\nfind his arch approach unnecessary and a bit annoying:\nhe seems in a perpetual pursuit of the pun, an\naffliction not entirely unknown in these hallowed\nhalls.  However, I have the same criticism of Philip\nHoward's commentaries on language published,\nfrom time to time, in <em>The Times</em> and, formerly, in\nthese pages, and I can only attribute attrition among\nVERBATIM subscribers to that and other weaknesses\nin myself.</p>\n<p>Because of the enormous variety of the pieces\ncollected here, the anthology is virtually impossible\nto review.  It doesn't, of course, deal with every aspect\nof language, but it does cover a very broad\nspectrum.  In fact, anyone who pretends to have an\ninterest in language and who has a library of worthwhile\nworks on the subject must have all of Safire's\nlanguage books in his library.  This is the sixth, to\nwhich must be added <em>Words of Wisdom</em> and <em>Good\nAdvice</em>, which he wrote with his brother, Leonard\nSafir.  The indexes are quite good, though not as exhaustive\nas one might have wished; yet one is likely\nto find what he is looking for without difficulty.\nMoreover, the books are attractively set out, which\nadds to their readability.  Even the title design is\nclever: it is shown on the jacket (over his photo,\nwhich the wretch clearly got his son to pose for),\ncover, and title page as,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>William Safire<br>\nLanguage Maven Strikes Again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is a pity that the articles are not provided with\nthe dates of their publication, though it is not difficult\nto understand why the publisher might be reluctant\nto do so.  Yet, when I read that a subscription\nto VERBATIM costs $10.00, while I am grateful for\nthe plug, I realize that the piece must have appeared\nquite some time ago.  A certain amount of updating\nmight be in order, perhaps by enclosing in square\nbrackets subscription rates in effect at the time of\npublication of the book.  Occasionally wrong, not\nonly is Bill not reluctant to admit his errors, he may\nbe one of the few who literally profited from their\nmistakes by compiling a book containing many of\nthem: called <em>I Stand Corrected</em> (Times Books, 1984),\nit actually contains other matter, too.</p>\n<p>To a subject that is treated in the most turgid\nfashion by linguists and with unusually irresponsible\nscholarship by many other commentators, Bill Safire\nbrings just the right, literate, human touch, often\nfunny, ever lively, and always friendly, informative,\nand entertaining.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
