We corresponded, and I persuaded Bob to write for VERBATIM. His lively, friendly, perceptive, well-written column appeared several times under the heading he chose, VERBUM SAP.

Alas, he succumbed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Five of the articles reprinted here are from VERBATIM, and that speaks for the high esteem I have of Bob's writing.

Perhaps I may be allowed to quote from that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is... an unalloyed delight to see Robertson Cochrane's cogent commentaries cap tured in book form, a less transitory medium than the periodicals in which they originally appeared....</p>\n<p>...[W]riting well is only half the task; one must also have something to say. Owing to the vastness of the English language, it is impossible to believe that one would run out of things to say about its myriad aspects. Indeed, the scholarly journals have been overflowing with turgid prose for decades, and it is particularly refreshing to know that comment on virtually any aspect of language can still be offered in language that, glowing with respectability, cleaving to the well-turned phrase, punctuated by the provocative pun, can be so engagingly presented.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>",
