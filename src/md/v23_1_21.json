The essays are brief and interesting and range throughout the entire spectrum of the subject, including literature. There is, for example, a piece on spoofs in which Rose cites several that are well known, omits others (like Poe's “The Great Balloon Hoax”), and includes at least one that is a satire, which is a different sort of animal: <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> is not, to my mind, a spoof. I am all in favor of weekly columns on language, but one must be careful.</p>\n<p>Rose is now seventy-six and, evidently, going strong. The book is informative and entertaining, but the reader should check the validity of some of Rose's comments before incorporating it into a doctoral dissertation or other important work. That admonition applies also to the blurb on the back cover, which, presumably, was composed by somebody at Kangaroo Press but not submitted to Rose for approval. It refers to “His vulgar vocabulary and facility in slang,” but—more important—it offers oddities like a reference to learning by rote on page 105 and to Pidgin on page 41: upon looking both up, I found nothing about rote learning on page 105 and nothing about Pidgin on page 41; nor was either listed in the sparse index. The cover copy also refers to his “endlessly entertaining analyses of literary terms such hypocorism [<em>sic</em>] palindrome, clerihew, idiom, [and] acronym”: of these, <em>acronym</em> and <em>hypocorism</em> are as absent from the index as the <em>as</em> between “such” and “hypocorism.” Perhaps such curiosities will make the book a collector's item, but whoever wrote the text for it at Kangaroo ought to be relegated to the outback.</p>\n<p>I am prejudiced, I know, but while I find the use of <em>impact</em> as a verb an interesting linguistic development, I consider it execrable style for literate speakers and (especially) writers; yet it appears in Rose's Preface, where one can also find a transitive use for <em>coruscate</em> (<em>OED2e</em> please note). It is not de rigueur for linguists or lexicographers to utter judgments about language, just as doctors are not supposed to react with revulsion should a patient reveal a particularly revolting affliction. But it seems to me (occasionally—like now) that it is just such prejudices that I am being paid to express. Otherwise, why bother reading a review?</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
