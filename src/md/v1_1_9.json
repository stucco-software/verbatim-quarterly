On\n4 August 1666 he writes, “Up and to the office, where all\nthe morning; and at noon to dinner, and Mr. Cooke dined\nwith us, who is lately come from Hinchingbrooke, who is\nalso come to town.” (<em>The Diary of Samuel Pepys,</em> ed.\nRobert Latham and William Matthew, University of California\nPress, VII, 234.)</p>\n<p>This is the only sentence I know of in English where a\nsingle proper noun designates at once a place and a person.\nLest the reader boggle, the editors put a superscript\nnumber after <em>who</em> and footnotes “I.e.
