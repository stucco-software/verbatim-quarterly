<p>Large corporations elicit little sympathy in our society.
Despite their employment of large numbers of people, their
providing of income and security to many who are shareholders,
their contributions to charity and worthwhile causes, and
their other activities that directly and indirectly affect the lives
of many with whom they have no discernible connection, large
corporations are often criticized, chiefly because they tend to
be impersonal and offer little in the way of individuals with
whom the man-in-the-street can identify.  The days of Henry
Ford, DuPont, and the unfortunate theme, “What's good for
General Motors is good for America,” are behind us, replaced
by the instant millionaires of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>This is not an apologia for corporations, large or small,
personal or impersonal; rather, it is to point out that all
companies share one concern: the protection of their rights and
property.  The governments of most countries that offer patent
and copyright registration make no claims of protection of
those registrations: it is the responsibility of every company to
protect itself, and the larger companies, with more resources at
their disposal, are generally better able to cope with what their
lawyers deem to be infringements.</p>
<p>This publication was first published in the spring of 1974,
and its name, VERBATIM, was immediately registered with the
U.S. Patent Office as a tradename.  That did not stop a western
manufacturer of computer media (mainly floppy discs) from
calling its product “Verbatim” several years later.  We filed a
formal protest attempting to block their registration of the
name, but we did not get very far because a quarterly
periodical on language was too remote from computer media to
be directly competitive.  (Thus, duPont cigarette lighters do not
“interfere” with DuPont chemicals or other products.)  A
settlement agreement was reached providing, basically, that
Verbatim media would not be sold containing any text or
information on them and VERBATIM would not go into the
computer media manufacturing business (at least, not using
that name).  (Several years after that agreement, we received a
firm note from theâevidentlyânew law firm for the manufacturer
who had just noticed our quarterly and wanted us to stop
using “their” name.  A quick note brought them up to date.  All
this is prompted by an advertisement in <em>Publishers Weekly</em> for
June 10, 1983, in which the Xerox Corporation (which, incidentally,
owns R.R. Bowker, the publisher of <em>PW</em>) reproduced a
part of a page from “a leading Roget's Thesaurus” in which
noun and verb synonyms for <em>duplicate</em> are given as “Xerox.”
The copyright notice indicates that the publisher is Doubleday
&amp; Company and, if I know anything about such matters, I can
vouch for Xerox's having written a firm but friendly letter to
Doubleday about the listings.  (The same listings appear in the
<em>Synonym Finder</em>, edited by someone named Laurence Urdang,
and published by Rodale Press, but those carry the label
“<em>Trademark</em>.”)  Protectors of trademarks insist that their
charges are adjectives.  Although people may say “Make a
Xerox copy of this, Miss Phoebelfinger,” when they do it is
likely that they are thinking about <em>Xerox</em> as a noun in
attributive position modifying <em>copy</em>, in much the same way as
one might analyze <em>house call, baby boom, paper profits,</em> or any
of the myriad other such combinations.  Yet the authors of the
Xerox advertisement write the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... But we'd like to bring up a grammatical point.</p>
<p>• The Xerox trademark is not a noun.  Nor is it a verb.  It
is a proper adjective and should always be followed by
a word or phrase describing one of our products.  Such
as a Xerox copier, Xerox word processor, Xerox electronic
printing system, etc.</p>
<p>• So please check your Thesaurus and, if necessary, make
these corrections.  And please feel free to use Xeroxâthe
proper adjectiveâas a part of your speech.</p>
<p>• That way you can be sure that when you ask for a
Xerox product, you'll get only a Xerox product.  And not
just a synonym.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sympathetic though we may be toward the protection of
trademarks and copyrights and patents, it seems obvious to all
that the entire matter, whatever its legal weight, is merely a
trivial token of protest: language cannot be legislated (except,
perhaps, in France) nor can its grammar or even its “grammatical
points.”  It is unlikely that any analysis by a grammarian or
other linguist would yield the information that <em>Xerox</em> is only a
proper adjective.  Moreover, adjectives are identified not by
legislation but by analysis of text; in such circumstances
<em>English</em> is a proper adjective in <em>English muffin, French</em> is one in
<em>French letter</em>, and <em>American</em> is one in <em>American English</em>.  But
<em>English</em> is a noun in <em>He speaks English</em> and <em>French</em> is a verb in
<em>Let's French Oswald's bed</em>.</p>
<p>Besides all this, language is usually considered as essentially
spoken, written language being merely an adjunct form.
To be sure, writing has been around long enough to have
acquired various styles of its own (in the sense that we have
formalized certain kinds of writing so that they differ from
what almost anyone is likely to say, viva voce), but that is not
at issue here.  The proverbial fly on the wall would probably be
able to cite <em>Xerox</em> as a verb and as a noun millions of times a
day in offices all over the world.</p>
<p>That fact dismays trademark lawyers.  Imagine starting a
company that manufactures a particular product.  Surely, your
dream would be to make the name of that product a “household
word,” uttered by anyone in preference to any other term
that might exist for the product or the process it performs.  In
this way, the British use <em>hoover</em> for <em>vacuum</em> (verb) and <em>vacuum
cleaner</em>, and Americans use <em>thermos</em> for <em>vacuum bottle</em>.
(Although <em>Thermos</em> is still a trademark of the Thermos Company,
it is also a generic used to describe a Pelican vacuum
bottle.)  As the story goes, <em>Cellophane</em> was once a trademark, a
status that was lost when, at a legal proceeding, the company's
attorney was asked, “If this product were not called 'Cellophane,'
then what would you call it?”  At a loss to offer a
suitable generic, the case was lost, and <em>cellophane</em> became a
generic name.</p>
<p>Such is not the problem with <em>Xerox</em>, for there are generics
that can be substitutedâ<em>machine copy</em> or just <em>copy</em>.  The
difficulty arises because the Xerox Corporation has been so
successful in promoting its copiers that the word <em>Xerox</em> is on
everyone's lips, even for copying done on machines that do not
employ the xerographic process.  Trying to remove a word from
everyone's lips is like trying to persuade women everywhere to
stop wearing lipstick.  Such are the vicissitudes of success.</p>
