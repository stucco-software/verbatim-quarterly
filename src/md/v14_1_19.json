In\nsome instances, one might criticize a bit of overwriting,\noften the result of the authors' attempt at\nlightening the burden of scholarship that inevitably\nattends the research into word origins.  No one who has\nbeen frustrated by the telegraphic, often cryptic style\nimposed on etymologists <em>in vitro</em>—that is, in their dictionaries—will\nfail to be satisfied by the full <em>in vivo</em>\ntreatment offered here.  The choice of entries (“more\nthan 500”) is eclectic if viewed superficially: as someone\nwho has worked on more etymologies than I can\nshake my <em>shtick</em> at, it seems to me that the words have\nbeen chosen because their histories are interesting, surprising,\ntypical of a particular category of word generation\nor borrowing, or “all of the above.”  The editors\nhave the enormous advantage of an available citation\nfile, which must be a good one; they also have lost\nneither their sense of humor nor their perspective in\ndiscussing the words selected.  Not only is the style\nrefreshing but every page reflects original scholarship,\nnot just the same old turf plowed over again.  The\neditors took the trouble to find out about <em>Quaaludes</em>,\nfor example, and did not just guess at its source.
