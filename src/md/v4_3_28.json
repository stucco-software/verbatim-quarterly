But — let us\nrejoice — one need not go stravaiging from the sea-coast of\nIreland to that of Bohemia to be charmed by the gulls of\nJoyce quarking for Muster Mark or to be gulled by the charms\nof Germanic etymology.  In any case, when Irish gulls talk\nabout cottage cheese, they have the decency to call it bonnyclabber. [<em>Frederic G.
