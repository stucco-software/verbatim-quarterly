It was a source of satisfaction to this author therefore, to read the interesting and comprehensive article “The Celtic Element in English” by Cornelius J. Crowley of St. Louis University [VERBATIM II, 2, 9].  I certainly wish to add my voice to his, in decrying the minimizing of the Celtic contribution. Herewith are some further examples of words used in English whose etymological roots stem from an original Celtic influence: <em>ambassador</em>, from the original Celtic <em>ambi-actus</em>, 'messenger' (lit. 'one sent around'), by way of the Latin <em>ambactus</em>, 'helper or henchman'; <em>andiron</em>, from the Gaulish <em>andera</em>, 'heifer' (through association with cow's horns as decorations); <em>ballyhoo</em>, from the name of the village (<em>Ballyhooly</em>) in Ireland noted for its brawls; <em>bug</em>, from the Welsh <em>bwg</em>, 'bogie' or 'ghost'; <em>bunny</em>, from the Gaelic <em>bun</em>, meaning 'bottom' (the tail of a hare or a rabbit); <em>coracle</em>, from the Welsh <em>corwgl</em>, 'boat'; <em>corgi</em>, this Welsh word consists of <em>corr</em> 'dwarf' and <em>ci</em> 'dog'; <em>cwm</em>, Welsh for 'valley,' used as a geographic term; <em>eistoddfod</em>, 'Welsh musical or poetic competition' from the Welsh <em>eisteddfodau</em>, 'sitting' or 'session'; <em>flannel</em>, from the Welsh <em>gwlanen</em>, which comes from the word <em>gwlan</em> meaning 'wool'; <em>gab</em>, Gaelic for 'mouth' (and hence 'chatter') from which we also get the word <em>gob</em> (in England a popular form of candy for children is “gobstoppers”), and its derivatives <em>gobble</em> and <em>goblet; galore</em>, from the Gaelic <em>gu</em> 'to' and <em>leor</em> 'sufficiency'; <em>galosh</em>, from the Gaulish <em>gallica</em>, 'sandal' (cf. Latin <em>calligula</em>, 'soldier's boot'); <em>German</em>, from the Celtic <em>gairm</em>, a battle cry transmitted via the Latin <em>Germanus; golf</em>, from the Gaelic <em>gowf</em> 'blow with the hand' (an acceptable pronunciation for <em>golf</em> is “gof”); <em>gull</em>, from the Welsh <em>gwylan</em> or the Breton <em>gwelan</em>, 'sea bird'; <em>havoc</em>, from the Welsh <em>hafog</em> 'devastation'; <em>hooligan</em>, a variant of the personal Irish surname <em>Houlihan; hulla-baloo</em>, the Irish name given to 'wailing at funeral ceremonies'; <em>humbug</em>, from the Irish <em>uim</em> bog 'soft copper' (which was used to debase and counterfeit official coinage); <em>key</em>, from the Celtic <em>cai</em> 'reef' or 'low island' (cf. <em>quay</em> and Spanish <em>cayo</em>); <em>lag</em>, from the Cornish <em>lag</em> 'wet and soiled'; <em>Limerick</em>, from the place name in Ireland; <em>mallarkey</em>, from the Irish personal surname which became associated with insincere or meaningless speech; <em>minion</em>, from a Celtic word meaning 'small,' hence 'follower' or 'servile'; <em>palfrey</em>, from the Gaulish <em>voredos</em> (cf. Latin <em>veredus</em> 'fast horse') and related to Welsh <em>gorwydd</em> 'horse'; <em>penguin</em>, from the Welsh <em>pen</em> 'head,' and <em>gwyn</em> 'white'; <em>plaid</em>, from Gaelic <em>plaide</em> meaning a blanket or a woolen cloth; <em>poteen</em>, from the Irish <em>poiteen</em>, diminutive of <em>pota</em> 'pot,' and associated with the illicit distillation of whiskey; <em>shenanigan</em>, from the Irish <em>sionnachuighim</em>, 'I play the fox' connoting 'deceit,' 'trickery,' or 'nonsense,' <em>shinny</em>, from the Gaelic <em>sinteag</em> 'skip' or 'jump,' from which we also get <em>shindig</em>, 'type of dance' or 'social affair'; <em>sporran</em>, from the Gaelic <em>sporan</em> 'purse' or 'pouch'; <em>Strathspey</em> a Scottish place name, and the name of a dance; <em>truant</em>, from the Welsh <em>truan</em> 'wretch' or 'vagabond'; <em>tory</em>, from the Irish <em>toriudhe</em> 'robber' or 'highwayman,' or from the Gaelic <em>toir</em> 'pursuit' (in origin the word referred to 17th century Irishmen who, having been dispossessed, became outlaws).</p>\n<p>A number of place names in Cornwall appear to be English, but are actually Anglicized forms of the original Cornish.
