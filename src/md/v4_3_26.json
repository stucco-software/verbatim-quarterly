Not\ntoo long ago, Gödel showed (roughly speaking) that within\nany discipline of logic or mathematics, theorems could be\nvalidly formulated which could not conceivably be proven\ntrue or proven false.  The prototypical such theorem is the\nfamous, “This theorem cannot be proven true,” which poses\nobvious difficulties to someone trying to prove or disprove it.\nThe theorem quoted is simply a formalization of the similar\none, “This sentence is false,” which opens Mr. Pollock's article.\nGödel's work is taken as demonstrating that mathematics is\nintrinsically 'incomplete' in that questions may be posed\nwhich cannot be answered.</p>\n<p>There is a related question: is mathematics consistent?\nThat is, having proven some theorem, say, Theorem X, are\nwe sure that the antithesis of Theorem X, say, Theorem anti-X,\ncannot be proven?  It would be unfortunate if we could deduce\nboth X and anti-X from valid argument.  But there is\nnow reason to believe that a proof of consistency cannot be\nachieved—not simply that we do not know one at the moment,\nbut that one cannot conceivably exist.  As someone said,\n“We know God exists, for mathematics is consistent; but we\nknow the Devil exists, for we cannot prove that consistency.” [<em>Alan A. Grometstein, Stoneham, Massachusetts</em>].</p>\n<h2></h2>",
