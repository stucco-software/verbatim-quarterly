<p>“Revising a dictionary?” my friends say, “That must be a
pretty straightforward sort of job.”  In some ways it is;
dictionaries feed on other dictionaries.  Daniel Fenning's <em>Royal
English Dictionary</em> in 1761 inadvertently omitted the word
<em>uncle</em> and a succession of dictionaries after his had the same
tell-tale gap.  A revision is of course even more openly derivative.
But it is not without its problems.</p>
<p>Take one example.  <em>The Australian Pocket Oxford Dictionary</em>,
which I am currently revising, has as a definition of
<em>quinine-tree</em> 'horse-radish tree (<em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em>) or
native quince, with bitter bark.'  Seems straightforward enough.
Need to check a couple of cross-references and the Latin
name.  These scientific names in Australia seem to be almost as
unreliable as vernacular names.  Snakes called <em>Demansia</em> a while
ago are <em>Pseudonaja</em> now.  A pretty little green bird called a
<em>greenie</em> or <em>chickowee</em> used to be officially <em>Meliphaga</em> and is now
<em>Lichenostomus</em>, and three species of Australian magpies,
because they were found to interbreed, are now one species
with the old specific names retained as varietal names, so that
South Australia's emblem, the white-backed magpie, <em>maggie</em> to
his friends, is in full dress <em>Gymnorhina tibicens hypoleuca</em>.  So
back to <em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em>.</p>
<p>First we put to one side, as a separate problem, the
<em>quinine bush (Alstonia constricta)</em> and concentrate on the
quinine-<em>tree</em>.  A useful up-to-date guide to botanical names is
Jean Galbraith's <em>Collins Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of
South-East Australia</em>, so we try that for <em>quinine-tree</em>.  It is there
along with another alternative name, <em>cracker-bush</em>, but the
botanical name is given as <em>Petalostigma glabrescens</em> (not
<em>quadriloculare</em>); there is no mention of horse-radish trees.  We
go to the new <em>Macquarie Dictionary</em>.  It does include <em>horse-radish
tree</em> but identifies it as <em>Moringa pterygosperma</em>; it does
not mention quinine-trees or cracker-bushes.  <em>The Australian
Encyclopaedia</em> (the older and fuller 1956 edition) is probably
the source of the entry for <em>quinine-tree</em> in the first edition of
my dictionary; it also identifies <em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em> as
<em>quinine-tree</em> but adds the names <em>crab-tree, native quince</em>, and
<em>emu-apple</em>, mentioning that all these names are shared by other
plants.  <em>The Australian Pocket Oxford Dictionary</em> already has an
entry for <em>emu-apple</em> but calls it <em>Owenia acidula</em> (also called
<em>native nectarine</em> or <em>native peach</em>).  It doesn't have <em>crab-tree</em>.  The
<em>Macquarie</em> agrees with it about <em>emu-apple</em> but doesn't have
<em>crab-tree</em> either.  Galbraith can't be referred to for <em>Owenia</em>
because it is not a south-eastern plant.</p>
<p><em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</em> gives <em>quinine-tree</em>
as an alternative name for three separate trees.  One is
the <em>horse-radish tree</em> (which is where we came in), but
reference to its entry reveals that it refers to two trees.  One of
them does have the generic name <em>Moringa</em>, but it is an East
Indian tree <em>(M. oleifera)</em>; the other is Australian, but it has the
generic name <em>Codonocarpus</em>.  The other two references are to
<em>hop tree</em> (an American tree) and <em>native quince</em> which does
indeed lead us back to the Australian tree and the name
<em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em>.  But is their information up to
date?  The search goes on.  There are botanists to write to,
library lists of taxonomical names to consult.  But sooner or
later a decision must be reached and all the available information
condensed into an allowable line or two before the next
word is attacked.</p>
<p>And, similarly condensing my newsletter in a line or so,
you will be patient next time you find one of those apparently
vague but in fact very precise dictionary definitions of the kind
'any of various Australian trees or shrubs.'</p>
