The operation was a\ngreat success, and a couple of days afterward my father\nreceived a get-well card from Mr. Kaplan.  The\npicture was suitable enough, but the handwritten\nmessage read, “Dear Harry - Hoping this will be\nyour last illness....”</p>\n<p>Alas, one rarely hears the echt Litvisch accent\nthese days.  Mr. Kaplan's generation has largely died\noff, and its progeny have become Americanized.  We\nlose in color what we gain in homogeneity.</p>\n<h1></h1>",
