Though seemingly self-explanatory, it is also possible that the word is a fusion of two separate <em>flash</em>es, one meaning 'a sudden outburst or issuing forth of flame or light,' the other a term describing a body of water.</p>\n<p>The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> has little information on “flash flood” besides listing it as a vocabulary item; no dates are given for its earliest use. <em>Random House</em> <em>Dictionary of the English Language</em> (2nd ed) describes a <em>flash flood</em> in more topographical terms, viz., “a sudden and destructive rush of water down a narrow gully or over a sloping surface, caused by heavy rainfall,” and lists its first occurrence as between 1935 and 1940.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b2\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">1</a></sup> The National Weather Service characterizes a <em>flash</em> flood as a sudden rushing of water which follows heavy storms, and which is likely to recede in less than six hours. The term is used in opposition to <em>river</em> flooding, which is of a significantly longer duration.</p>\n<p>A homonym of <em>flash,</em> however, is worthy of note. The <em>English Dialect Dictionary</em> includes a term <em>flash</em> (Middle English <em>flasshe</em>) with the definition “[a] pool, shallow sheet of water; a swamp, marshy pond.” Among the many quotations found under the entry are “a hollow boggy place, grown over with rushes and flags,” and “the waters that lodge in wet seasons on Brumby West-common.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b3\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">2</a></sup> That the term could also be linked specifically to flooding is suggested in a report found in the <em>Dublin Review</em> on the dangers of over-mining, where we find the following:</p>\n<p>The market-place, after sinking 30 feet, and requiring reconstruction, has now found a solid foundation, the entire salt bed beneath it having been worked out. Near the Station Road, which has sunk 40 feet, is to be seen a house with its ridge tiles and chimneys a few feet above ground, the remainder of the premises having gone down. In some places large lakes, called “flashes” are formed, some of them more than 200 acres in area and gradually extending.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b4\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>The term (in various forms) is found in many northern and central English place names, usually ones denoting swampy areas or low fields.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b5\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b5\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">4</a></sup> Indeed, the doublet <em>flass</em> does exist, indicating a depression or low-lying area. In a discussion in <em>Notes and Queries</em> concerning the place-name <em>Flass</em> (also known as <em>Flask</em>), a river village near Durham, derivations from both meanings are suggested: Chevallier and “Ceyrep” see the name as relating to its position in the low area of the river plain<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b6\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b6\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">5</a></sup> ; “Wulstan,” however, connects it with the Celtic root <em>esc, usc</em> 'water' (cf. Irish <em>uisce,</em> <em>whiskey</em>), which is preceded by an (unexplained) sequence <em>fl-.</em> He refers to the Swedish lake <em>Flasjon,</em> the river name <em>Flesh</em> in County Kerry, and the term <em>flash</em> “a sluice erected upon rivers.”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b7\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b7\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>The combination <em>fl-</em> + <em>ash</em> is conceivable though unlikely, especially given some of the over-enthusiastic derivations of English words from Celtic in the nineteenth century. On the other hand, it is possible that the <em>fl-</em> sequence is sound-symbolic, either for the meaning 'moving [water]' (<em>flow, flood, float,</em> Latin <em>fluere</em>) or for the group that contains English <em>flat</em> and German <em>flach</em> (thus the sense or a 'collection of water in lowlands').<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-b8\" id=\"user-content-user-content-fnref-b8\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"user-content-footnote-label\">7</a></sup> The meaning 'to flow,' however, seems to be the more likely: it would support the primary sense of “small lake, pool” (especially one that exists seasonally), but also the designation for a 'sluice,' as well as providing a derivation for <em>flashing</em> 'a metallic sealant for roofs to guide water away.'</p>\n<p>Flash floods are sudden floods, but they may also be ones that initially had to do with actual <em>flashes.</em> True, the term <em>flash flood</em> is more than a little reminiscent of <em>flash fire</em> 'a sudden and destructive fire,' but it is possible that the original sense of the <em>flash flood</em> was a kind of flood which affected lowland areas (or was simply a collection of water in low areas), as in the reference to salt-mines. Later, through the influence of the other <em>flash</em> 'sudden outburst,' it took on its current meaning.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>[Ari Hoptman is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Minnesota.
