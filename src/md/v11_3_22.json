This relationship\nis more easily perceptible in the German word for chess,\n<em>Schach.  Checkmate</em> comes from <em>shah mat</em> 'the king is dead.'</p>\n<p>From c.1650 to c.1850 many Persian words entered the\nEnglish vocabulary.  Some came directly, but most did not, this\ntime being filtered through Turkish and Hindi.  Included in this\ngroup are such words as <em>shawl, seersucker</em> and <em>khaki</em>—all of\nwhich indicate Iran's longstanding importance as a textile and\nfashion center.  Also belonging to this group is <em>cummerbund</em>,\nfirst coined by the Hindus but coming from Persian <em>kamar</em>\n'waist' + <em>band</em> 'band.'  Very few western words entered Persian\nduring this period, the notable exception being the French\n<em>merci</em>—no Persian word for “thank you” had existed prior to\nthe late seventeenth century.  I wonder what a (socio)linguist\nwould make of that.</p>\n<p><em>Poló</em>, the Iranian word for 'rice,' took perhaps the longest\nand most difficult route.  Picked up by Arabs in the ninth\ncentury, it somehow spread to Arab-controlled Spain by the\nearly 11th century.  By the early 15th century it had become\nthe Castilian <em>paella</em>, now referring to a rice-based dish usually\nmade with seafood.  On to France where, in the mid 16th\ncentury, it became <em>pilaf</em>.  By now, both <em>pilaf</em> and <em>paella</em> are\nstandard English.</p>\n<p><em>Peach</em>, coming from the Latin <em>mālus persica</em> 'Persian\napple,' cannot, of course, be described as originating in Persia,\nbut is still an interesting toponym.</p>\n<p>Other words of cultural significance include <em>drum, tambourine</em>,\nand <em>guitar</em>, all of which seem to have their earliest\nroots in Farsee.</p>\n<p>The more recent alleged contributions are less plausible.\n<em>Haägen-Dazs</em>, for example, means nothing in any language\nexcept Persian, where <em>hokh-an-dause</em> means 'garbage can.'  That\nparticular brand of ice cream would probably sell even worse\nin Iran than Perdue chickens would in France.</p>\n<p>Equally interesting is the insight Persian gives into a\ncertain surname.  Philologists have woodenly assumed that\n<em>Urdang</em> originally comes from Middle High Germany, presumably\nmeaning “primordial wisdom,” “original knowledge,” or\nthe like.  Yet I will now assert that perhaps it comes from\nFarsee: <em>urdang-ee</em> means 'kick in the ass.' (Mr. Urdang should\nconsider himself far more fortunate than the NCAA soccer\ncoach of the year, Diether Ficken: German <em>ficken</em> 'to fuck'; and\ncertainly no worse off than former CBS anchorman Walter\nCronkite: German <em>Krankheit</em>, 'sickness, disease.')</p>\n<p>[Which may be why I ran.—<em>Ed</em>.]</p>",
