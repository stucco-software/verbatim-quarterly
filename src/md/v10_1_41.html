<p>There is only one “<em>The Times</em>,” and that is the newspaper
published six days a week in London.  <em>The Sunday Times</em>,
published weekly, also in London, and <em>The New York Times</em>,
published seven days a week in You-know-where, are not the
same.</p>
<p><em>The Times</em> takes some pride in the care with which it is
written and edited, and the results are quite obvious most of
the time.  As Lord Deming remarked at a recent awards dinner
for journalists, the journalistic tradition is strong in England,
where every effort is made to uphold a high standard of
language style and usage.  My second clue that something might
be awry was revealed when I distinctly heard Lord Deming say
“viligent” (presumably for <em>vigilant</em>).  The first clue came a few
days earlier, when <em>The Times</em> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sandra Jackson, aged 19, who is expecting her second
child in three months' time...  [16 February 1983]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can it be, I asked myself, that the birth rate in Britain (which,
I noted earlier in January, stood at zero) is in for a change?  Or,
perhaps, Mrs. Jackson had been got to by the test-tube baby
crowd?</p>
<p>Clues continued to accumulate.  On 18 February appeared
the information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a plastic bag over his head when Sir Trevor
[Dawson], aged 51, was found by his chauffeur.  An
inquest will be held, but the police said there was [<em>sic</em>]
no suspicious circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interesting point here is not the singular verb/plural noun
problem, but what the police in England might consider
“suspicious circumstances” to be.  Perhaps it is/they are something
like “Mr. Aâis helping the police in their enquiries,”
usually translated into real English as “Mr. Aâ is under
suspicion of [whatever the crime might be].”</p>
<p>Maintaining the talent for curious juxtapositions of information,
<em>The Times</em> (again on 18 February) reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Peter Bird] will have broken the world record for
staying at sea in a rowing boat when he celebrates his
37th birthday tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That must, indeed, be a record.</p>
<p>“PHS,” author of “The Times Diary,” a regular feature of
the page facing the editorials, is not known to be above
apostrophizing.  Yet the column for 28 February carries the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those whose interests David has now bought include
his brothers, Jonathan and Nicholas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who live in or have visited England are aware of
the weight of the coins one accumulates in a jacket pocket or a
purse; notwithstanding the parlous state of the pound these
days, a pocketful of change worth £1 would appear to weigh at
least 18 ounces, giving male residents and visitors to that
seafaring nation a perceptible list to starboard.  Always sensitive
to the comforts of the commoner, the House of Lords, as
reported in <em>The Times</em> of 4 March, has heard debate on the
Currency Bill suggesting that, because of this financial burden
carried by citizens, trouser pockets should be free of VAT
(value added tax) charges.  Lord Lyell, in response to this
suggestion, pointed out that, as people in Scotland carried their
money in sporrans when they were not wearing trousers, the
proposal should be extended to highland dress.</p>
<p>A photograph in the same issue of the newspaper shows
workers contemplating strike at the Citroën plant in France, a
country recently plagued by workers' walkouts.  <em>The Times</em>
captions the photo, “The French Disease?”  Perhaps someone
will send in a French letter explaining what the French disease
is.</p>
<p>In the caption on another photograph, we learn that the
tarsier is a “member of a little-known zoological group called
Asiatic profimians,” prompting us to wonder whether that
group, if in favor of “fimians,” is anti something.  In any event,
it is probably a fringe group and, in fact, so little is known as to
be nonexistent.</p>
