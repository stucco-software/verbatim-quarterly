Permissible to whom?  Surely not to linguists or other\nlanguage professionals or to society.  Otherwise, Freeman's\nadvice seems rather bland.  If you collect such books, you might\nfind some justification in adding this one to your stock; as a\nguide, there are others that are more interestingly written,\nmore authoritative, and more thorough in their treatment of\nthose bothersome ambiguities and unresolved questions of style\nthat, sooner or later, nettle us all.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
