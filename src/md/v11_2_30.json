Letter Loose!</h1>\n<p><em><span data-rel=\"author\">Alma Denny</span> <span data-rel=\"location\">New York, New York</span></em></p>\n<p>“Anger is only one letter away from danger,” reminds\nmy philosopher-friend in the homily he mails to me\neach month.</p>\n<p>Only one letter, but what havoc it can cause when\nomitted, added, misplaced, changed!  Wars may have been\naverted, marriages saved, jobs preserved simply because of\nconscientious proofreaders who rescued <em>marital</em> from <em>martial,\nuniformed</em> from <em>uninformed</em>, and <em>singers</em> from <em>sinners</em>, in the\nnick.</p>\n<p>But one-letter-mayhem still abounds, whether fresh from\nthe typist or the typesetter, and everyone has lists of examples\nwhich amuse, shock, amaze, and shake, at the power of that\nsmall one twenty-sixth of the alphabet.  For example, it can\nturn:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Friend into Fiend</p>\n<p>Lots of talent into Loss of talent</p>\n<p>Hire into Fire</p>\n<p>Million into Billion</p>\n<p>Engaged girl into Enraged girl</p>\n<p>United into Untied</p>\n<p>Nuclear into Unclear</p>\n<p>Comely into Homely</p>\n<p>Wool business into Woo business</p>\n<p>Married into Marred</p>\n<p>Milestone into Millstone</p>\n<p>Inducting a judge into Indicting a judge</p>\n<p>Deifying into Defying</p>\n<p>Venial into Venal</p>\n<p>Moral into Amoral</p>\n<p>Brother into Bother</p>\n<p>Recital into Rectal</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Years ago, while a senator, Hubert H. Humphrey was\nquoted in print as having called the then Vice-President,\nRichard M. Nixon, a “slocker,” and was forced to insist that\nthe term he used was “slicker,” a form of palatable rhubarb\nduring Presidential campaigns.  But just that one letter could\nhave conceivably promoted a libel suit or, in Aaron Burr's time,\neven a duel.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the one-letter gremlin forces a double-take as\nwe encounter him in context, as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the fire broke out, 20-year-old Russell was alone\nin the house with his baby sitter.</p>\n<p>For several reasons, Clarinda LaRue has played leading\nrôles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the victims of slips such as these there may be some\ncomfort in the knowledge that most people don't read very\ncritically, just scan lines of print to “get the drift,” and may not\nnotice that what is said may, thanks to one errant letter, be not\nat all what is meant.  The absolutely hapless victim, however, is\nthe one caught up in a headline—big bold print that's inescapable.\nWhat could John Doe do when his picture appeared\non the Financial Page of his local newspaper under this banner:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>John Doe Chosen to Ruin Machine Works Corp.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only person we know who didn't object to an error in\na headline was Harry S. Truman when an early edition of a\nnewspaper declared Thomas E. Dewey the winner in the 1948\nPresidential election.  Copies of that error are preserved under\nglass and treasured.</p>\n<p>As for the one-letter mischief afoot, let us rejoice that\nthere are only 26 possible culprits.  The Polish alphabet has 45\nletters,—but censors, rather than proofreaders, keep them all in\nplace.</p>",
