Legal: “The terms used by those not legally married range from the legal\n( common law marriage ) to the jocular ( shacking\nup ).” Wrong: Those who are found by a court to\nhave entered into a valid common law marriage are\nlegally married. As I tell my law students, being\nmarried is rather like being pregnant: you either\nare, or you aren't. Verbiage: “ Cohabitating is a clinical, sterile word used by statisticians.” Poorly educated statisticians, perhaps. The preferred word is, of course, cohabiting. One inhabits a house rather\nthan inhabitates it. Oversight: “Now that many\nsame-sex couples can have their relationships registered in Vermont and New York and in some Scandinavian countries as a civil union or registered\npartnership , new terms should emerge.” They\nalready have. I guess that no one has ever suggested, suggestively, to the author, “I'll 'C U' in Vermont.”</p>\n<p><em>[Robert E. Rains]</em></p>",
