And it has this for <em>quantum jump</em> (or <em>leap</em>): “an abrupt transition in an atom or molecule from one quantum state to another.” Of course.</p>\n<p>For many years <em>quantum leap</em> (or <em>jump</em>) belonged exclusively to the physicists, but during the past quarter-century or so it has come to be used metaphorically by speakers and writers who like to flaunt that sort of thing. It now designates a sudden, spectacular, extensive change in a program or policy or process—“a major breakthrough,” or something along that line. But long before the physicists got hold of <em>quantum</em> it was used by ordinary writers. The <em>OED</em> reports that <em>quantum</em> (from the Latin <em>quantus:</em> 'how much, how great') has been used in English since early in the 17th century.</p>\n<p>In 1786 Robert Burns used it in his poem, “Epistle to a Young Friend,” in which he, interestingly, warned against casual sexual indulgence: “I waive the quantum o' the sin, / The hazard of concealing; / But, och! it hardens a' within, / And petrifies the feeling.” The <em>OED</em> does not give Burns's use of the word as an example, but other Scots may have been influenced by it. Thomas Carlyle in 1857, wrote of “Some smaller quantum of earthly enjoyment.” Edward Caird, theologian and philosopher, in 1877 offered this observation: “All phenomena, as perceived, are extensive quanta.” (I must memorize that: it could useful as a conversation muddler.) The <em>OED Supplement</em> devotes nearly seven columns to <em>quantum</em> and compounds in which it is used.</p>\n<p>Critics point out that in physics a quantum leap is actually a very small change, but nevertheless a significant one. Despite the illogical element in the popular, metaphorical use of the phrase, it does seem to have become firmly imbedded in current discourse. But perhaps it has already become what Fowler called a “battered ornament.”</p>\n<p>While reading about <em>quantum</em> in the <em>OED Supplement</em>, I noticed the preceding word, <em>quantophrenia</em>, which is defined as “A term used for an obsession with and exaggerated reliance upon mathematical methods or results, especially in research connected with the social sciences.” It also gives <em>quantophrenic</em>. Useful words, clinically.</p>",
