Language, in its function as a\nmedium for communicating ideas, necessarily is subject\nto the dictates of convention.  If a particular usage\ncomes to be established in the broad community of\nlanguage users, the railings of purists, schoolmarms,\neditors, or TV commentators will be likely to have little\neffect on that usage.  Language does not necessarily\noperate according to the strictures of logic, reason, or\nauthority.  As Mr. Koppel is aware, convention seems\nto be favoring the pronunciation “HAL-ee,” and it is\nquite futile to go against such a trend.  Those who\nwrangle with language convention do so at the risk of\nbeing written off as pedants, stick-in-the-muds, or\nelitists.</p>",
