Therefore, in\norder to derive the best use from this extremely sane, useful\nwork the reader must first look through it to familiarize\nhimself with its contents, then go back to use it as a\nreference guide; when the appropriate occasion arises, he\nmay be fortunate enough to remember what it contains\n(e.g., MNEMONIC).</p>\n<p>The information in the entries is clearly set forth.

Also, <em>kidnaped, kidnaping,</em>\nbecause of the secondary stress on the -<em>nap of kidnap</em>, are\nmore often spelled with double p (Brenner to the contrary).\nAnd what of <em>cancellation</em> and the many other words like\n<em>cancel and benefit?</em> It isn't apparent that the author has\ngiven a role with some illustrations, but that opacity may be\nowing more to the style of the book than to its writing.\nBesides, emphasis that such a rule is followed in American\nEnglish but not in British would have been useful.</p>\n<p>Generally, the entries cover topics traditionally treated\nin usage books and manuals; but it is the extra added attractions\nthat make the book interesting, even though I am not\nalways sure why they have been included. For example,\nwhy an entry on COSMO- (as in <em>cosmetic, cosmology,</em> etc.)\nunless it is because Brenner likes it? And the entry\nCOSELLISM is amusing and to the point, but I have never encountered\nthe word, hence would never think to look it up.\nSimilarly, the entry EDUCANTO/EDUCATIONIST offers some\ntelling comments, but who ever heard the term outside of\nKoerner's book (which I never heard of and which seems to\nbe missing from the credits in the introduction)?</p>\n<p>The book's style has a friendly, though admonitory,\npractical ring to it, and it contains a lot of solid information\nand advice. If you can afford it and/or like to collect such\nworks, it is a worthwhile book to have around.</p>\n<p><em>Laurence Urdang</em></p>\n<h1></h1>",
