  <h3>Antipodean English: <em>Harmless Drudgery</em></h3>
  <p><span data-rel="author">G.W. Turner</span></p>
  <p>“Revising a dictionary?” my friends say, “That must be a
  pretty straightforward sort of job.”  In some ways it is;
  dictionaries feed on other dictionaries.  Daniel Fenning's <em>Royal
  English Dictionary</em> in 1761 inadvertently omitted the word
  <em>uncle</em> and a succession of dictionaries after his had the same
  tell-tale gap.  A revision is of course even more openly derivative.
  But it is not without its problems.</p>
  <p>Take one example.  <em>The Australian Pocket Oxford Dictionary</em>,
  which I am currently revising, has as a definition of
  <em>quinine-tree</em> 'horse-radish tree (<em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em>) or
  native quince, with bitter bark.'  Seems straightforward enough.
  Need to check a couple of cross-referencesâand the Latin
  name.  These scientific names in Australia seem to be almost as
  unreliable as vernacular names.  Snakes called <em>Demansia</em> a while
  ago are <em>Pseudonaja</em> now.  A pretty little green bird called a
  <em>greenie</em> or <em>chickowee</em> used to be officially <em>Meliphaga</em> and is now
  <em>Lichenostomus</em>, and three species of Australian magpies,
  because they were found to interbreed, are now one species
  with the old specific names retained as varietal names, so that
  South Australia's emblem, the white-backed magpie, <em>maggie</em> to
  his friends, is in full dress <em>Gymnorhina tibicens hypoleuca</em>.  So
  back to <em>Petalostigma quadriloculare</em>.</p>
